"Currently used adaptive equalizers for the minimization of mean-square error in digital communications commonly employ a fixed-step-size gradient-search procedure. The algorithm to be described here employs variable step sizes designed to minimize the error after a specified number of iterations. The resultant convergence rate provides considerable improvement over the fixed-step-size approach. Bounds on the variance, valid for large signal-to-noise ratios, indicate that the new algorithm not only converges faster, but also has a smaller variance asymptotically than the present algorithm for moderate intersymbol interference and the same variance asymptotically for large intersymbol interference. Computer simulation studies have verified these results."
"Two nonparametric methods to estimate the Bayes risk using classified sample sets are described and compared. The first method uses the nearest neighbor error rate as an estimate to bound the Bayes risk. The second method estimates the Bayes decision regions by applying Parzen probability-density function estimates and counts errors made using these regions. This estimate is shown to be asymptotically consistent in mean square. The results of experiments with these estimators on simulated and empirical data imply that the estimators both have acceptable small-sample properties; however, small-sample convergence of both estimators depends strongly on the choice of metric and local area or window size in the measurement space."
"Some recognizers for stochastic time-varying patterns with additive noise are studied. As in binary communication channels with fading, it is supposed that the fluctuation of a pattern (or signal) may be approximated by a stationary Gaussian autoregressive process with known parameters. Each measurement belongs to either of two classes: the pattern plus noise or noise alone. Under these assumptions, optimum dichotomizers with supervized learning are discussed. To the nonsupervised problems, the decision-directed approach and the modified-decision-directed approach are applied. Also some experimental results are presented."
"A situation of great practical importance in pattern recognition is the case where the designer has only a finite number of sample patterns from each class and the class-conditional density functions are not completely known. Recent results indicate that in this case the dimensionality of the pattern vector, i.e., the number of measurements, should not be arbitrarily increased, since above a certain value (corresponding to the optimal measurement complexity), the performance starts to deteriorate instead of improving steadily. However, whether this phenomenon occurs in the case of independent measurements has been an open question until now. In this paper the following result of practical importance is derived. When the measurements are independent, and a Bayesian approach is taken, one can add extra measurements without fear of this peaking of performance; i.e., the optimal measurement complexity is infinite. In fact, under certain conditions, having just one sample from class 1, and none at all from class 2, can result in a recognition accuracy arbitrarily close to unity for a large enough number of measurements. The implication of these results to practice is discussed, along with the general question of dimensionality and sample size."
"A definition for channels with asymptotically decreasing memory and anticipation is given. The relation to indecomposable finite-state channels and to a certain class of infinite-state channels is established. It is shown that for channels with asymptotically decreasing memory and anticipation every ergodic input source is admissible and that the coding theorem holds."
"Most methods of encoding images require complicated implementation. Thus it is of interest to compare the transmission rates that can be achieved by classes of encoding methods of different complexity. We consider two classes of encoding operations. The first class allows any possible operation on the two-dimensional image source output. The second class allows only certain restricted operations on the image. In acquisition of images by electronic means, the image intensity is in general scanned line by line, resulting in data that appear as a sequence of ordinary time series. In encoding, a simpler implementation results if one accepts the time series from a single scan line and encodes it independently of adjacent scan lines. This limits storage requirements to a single scan line and limits processing to operations on a one-parameter time series instead of operations on a two-dimensional field. This is the second class of encoding operations that we consider. We choose a distortion measure and discuss the rate-distortion function, which represents the minimum rate required by any encoding method in the first (arbitrary complex encoding). We then derive the minimum rate that can be achieved by any encoder from the second class. These rates are compared for a specific example."
"The concept of invariance in hypothesis testing is brought to bear on the problem of detecting signals of known form and unknown energy in Gaussian noise of unknown level. The noise covariance function is assumed to beK(t,u) = \\sigma^2 \\pho(t,u)where\\rho(t,u)is the known form of the covariance function and\\sigma^2is the unknown level. Classical approaches to signal detection depend on the assumption thatK(t,u)is known completely. Then, a correlation-type receiver that is the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test ofH_o(signal absent) versusH_1(signal present) can be derived. When\\sigma^2is unknown, there exists no UMP test. However, it is shown in this paper that there exists a test ofH_oversusH_1that is UMP-invariant for a very natural group of transformations on the space of observations. The derived test is found to be independent of knowledge about the noise level\\sigma^2, since the derived test (receiver) contains an error-free estimate of\\sigma^2. This utopian conclusion is reconciled by noting that the derived receiver can never be physically realized. It is shown that any physically realizable version of the receiver has at-distributed test statistic. This permits choice of operating receiver thresholds and evaluation of performance characteristics."
"The probability of error for binary permutation modulation with diversity on fading Gaussian channels is considered. Upper bounds on the probability of error are found in a simple manner. These bounds indicate that the probability of error decreases exponentially with increasing transmitter memory as long as the transmitter's rate is less than the ratio of average received signal power to noise power per unit bandwidth. This asymptotic behavior is true for any form of binary permutation modulation with the proper order of diversity. Furthermore, orthogonal signals are found to be the most efficient form of binary permutation modulation."
"The following model for the white Gaussian channel with or without feedback is considered: \\begin{equation} Y(t) = \\int_o ^{t} \\phi (s, Y_o ^{s} ,m) ds + W(t) \\end{equation} wheremdenotes the message,Y(t)denotes the channel output at timet,Y_o ^ {t}denotes the sample pathY(\\theta), 0 \\leq \\theta \\leq t. W(t)is the Brownian motion representing noise, and\\phi(s, y_o ^ {s} ,m)is the channel input (modulator output). It is shown that, under some general assumptions, the amount of mutual informationI(Y_o ^{T} ,m)between the messagemand the output pathY_o ^ {T}is directly related to the mean-square causal filtering error of estimating\\phi (t, Y_o ^{t} ,m)from the received dataY_o ^{T} , 0 \\leq t \\leq T. It follows, as a corollary to the result forI(Y_o ^ {T} ,m), that feedback can not increase the capacity of the nonband-limited additive white Gaussian noise channel."
"Shannon showed that the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel can not be increased by noiseless feedback. It has been conjectured that this should be true for a continuous memoryless channel, provided such a channel is appropriately defined. We precisely define such a channel from two mathematically different points of view and rigorously prove that its capacity can not be increased by feedback."
"A fundamental spatial property is noted that relates the likelihood ratio for random signals in Gaussian noise to conditional-mean parameter estimation. This allows a geometric interpretation of the estimation-correlation operation. Some additional properties exhibited by the likelihood ratio are also presented."
"First it is shown how the Karhunen-Loève approach to the detection of a deterministic signal can be given a coordinate-free and geometric interpretation in a particular Hilbert space of functions that is uniquely determined by the covariance function of the additive Gaussian noise. This Hilbert space, which is called a reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), has many special properties that appear to make it a natural space of functions to associate with a second-order random process. A mapping between the RKHS and the linear Hilbert space of random variables generated by the random process is studied in some detail. This mapping enables one to give a geometric treatment of the detection problem. The relations to the usual integral-equation approach to this problem are also discussed. Some of the special properties of the RKHS are developed and then used to study the singularity and stability of the detection problem and also to suggest simple means of approximating the detectability of the signal. The RKHS for several multidimensional and multivariable processes is presented; by going to the RKHS of functionals rather than functions it is also shown how generalized random processes, including white noise and stationary processes whose spectra grow at infinity, are treated."
"This correspondence provides counterexamples to two frequently proposed conjectures concerning group codes for the Gaussian channel. It is shown 1) that a code for which the list of distances from codewordito all other words is independent ofiis not necessarily a group code, and 2) a group code ofMwords need not possess a transitive symmetry group of orderM."
"A decision-directed unsupervised estimation algorithm is used in a receiver that processes signals with unknown intersymbol interference. The estimator utilizes the statistical structure of this dependent sample problem to reduce the computational complexity. Asymptotic and experimental dynamic probability of error results are presented."
"The performances of various redundancy-reduction schemes for digital transmission of analog signals from stationary Gaussian-Markov sources are compared. The rate-distortion function for a source with a band-limited one-pole spectrum is given. It is shown that for nonband-limited sources, the signals should be passed through a low-pass filter of proper bandwidth."
"A Bayesian learning algorithm for statistically optimum adaptive gain control (AGC) is derived in which the receiver gain is adjusted during the learning process so that the average cost of excluding the received signal from the receiver's dynamic range is minimized. Application of the approach to the frequently occurring situation of Rayleigh-distributed signals of unknown strength yields a recursive algorithm that can be easily implemented."
 "The maximum-likelihood estimate based on order statistics for both a single-sample and anM-sample estimate are derived for the first-order Reed-Muller code sent over a zero-mean white Gaussian noise channel. The estimation method is subject to an equipment-complexity constraint. The constraint imposed requires that the estimates be obtained from successive comparisons of the correlations in a serial system, without the use of arithmetic operations. The maximum-likelihood estimates obtained here are compared to that of Posner [1], Posner et aL [2], and also the unrestricted maximum-likelihood estimate."
"Described here is a linear code that has a maximum distance between codewords ofkfor a code of order2^k. Since the minimum-maximum distance iskfor a code of order2^k, a class of minimum-maximum distance codes results. For an(n,k)linear code,k \\leq n \\leq k + k/2forkeven andk \\leq n \\leq k + (k - 1)/2forkodd. Maximum-distance codes are found useful in encoding the states of sequential circuits."
"The entropy at the output of a quantizer is equal to the average mutual information between unquantized and quantized random variables. Thus, for a fixed number of quantization levels, output entropy is a reasonable information-theoretic criterion of quantizer fidelity. It is shown that, for a class of signal distributions, which includes the Gaussian, the quantizers with maximum output entropy (MOE) and minimum average error (MAE) are approximately the same within a multiplicative constant."
"This correspondence discusses the transformations between the output autocorrelation functions of functionally related zero-memory nonlinear devices excited by signal plus Gaussian noise. The results are applied to show how output autocorrelation functions can easily be obtained for exponential and half-wave power law devices."
 "Two different problems of estimating a discrete stochastic process, in the face of Markov dependent uncertainty regarding the presence of the process at each stage of the observation sequence, are considered. Recursive Bayes optimal estimator algorithms are derived for the two cases considered, and the differences between them brought out explicitly."
"Given a set of conditionally independent binary-valued features, a counter example is given to a possible claim that the best subset of features must contain the best single feature."
 "This paper is concerned with the design of second-order algorithms for an equalizer in a training or a tracking mode. The algorithms govern the iterative adjustment of the equalizer parameters for the minimization of the mean-squared error. On the basis of estimated bounds for the eigenvalues of the signal plus noise correlation matrix, an optimal second-order algorithm is derived. The resultant convergence is considerably faster than the commonly used first-order fixed-size gradient-search procedure. The variance of the optimal algorithm is shown to have a slightly larger bound than the present first-order fixed-step algorithm. However, a computer simulation for an input signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB shows that for large intersymbol interference the improvement in the convergence of the mean more than compensates for the small increase in variance. For moderate intersymbol interference the simulation shows no variance increase. Suboptimum second-order algorithms with smaller improvement in the convergence rate and smaller increase in the variance bound are also considered. The results indicate that, on the average, the new algorithms lead to faster tracking of changes in the channel characteristics and thereby result in a smaller error rate."
"Intermediate frequency (IF) and video limiting are evaluated and compared for a two-channel coherent digital signal processor, where the video limiting is that of the analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, occurring separately in each channel. The input is a narrow-band random signal. Video limiting is shown to produce considerably higher distortion sidebands outside the input signal band. Within the input signal band, video-limiting distortion is about 1 dB worse. The results are useful for both the radar moving target indicator (MTI) and mapping applications."
"Modems for digital communication often adopt the so-called correlative level coding or the partial-response signaling, which attains a desired spectral shaping by introducing controlled intersymbol interference terms. In this paper, a correlative level encoder is treated as a linear finite-state machine and an application of the maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm, which was originally proposed by Viterbi in decoding convolutional codes, is discussed. Asymptotic expressions for the probability of decoding error are obtained for a class of correlative level coding systems, and the results are confirmed by computer simulations. It is shown that a substantial performance gain is attainable by this probabilistic decoding method."
"The direct product ofpsingle parity-check codes of block lengthsn_1,n_2, \\cdots ,n_pis a cyclic code of block lengthn_1 \\times n_2 \\times \\cdots \\times n_pwith(n_1 - 1) \\times (n_2 - 1) \\times \\cdots \\times (n_p - 1)information symbols per block, if the integersn_1,n_2 \\cdots ,n_pare relatively prime in pairs. A lower bound for the single-burst-correction (SBC) capability of these codes is obtained. Then, a detailed analysis is made forp = 3, and it is shown that the codes can correct one long burst or two short bursts of errors. A lower bound for the double-burst-correction (DBC) capability is derived, and a simple decoding algorithm is obtained. The generalization to correcting an arbitrary number of bursts is discussed."
"The attractiveness of majority-logic decoding is its simple implementation. Several classes of majority-logic decodable block codes have been discovered for the past two decades. In this paper, a method of constructing a new class of majority-logic decodable block codes is presented. Each code in this class is formed by combining majority-logic decodable codes of shorter lengths. A procedure for orthogonalizing codes of this class is formulated. For each code, a lower bound on the number of correctable errors with majority-logic decoding is obtained. An upper bound on the number of orthogonalization steps for decoding each code is derived. Several majority-logic decodable codes that have more information digits than the Reed-Muller codes of the same length and the same minimum distance are found. Some results presented in this paper are extensions of the results of Lin and Weldon [11] and Gore [12] on the majority-logic decoding of direct product codes."
"A three-alternative step-function process on two dimensions, with step size constrained in both directions, is considered. The maximum specific entropy is found to be only 1.02 bits/interval, compared with the 1.59 bits/interval that would be obtained if step size were constrained in only one direction."
"We consider the class of sequential estimation systems containing additive Gaussian noise channels. Letmbe a random variable representing the source andx(t),y(t)be stochastic processes representing the signal and the channel output, respectively. Denote by\\hat{m}an estimate ofmbased on observingy(t)from 0 to\\tau, where\\tauis a random variable determined by a certain stopping rule of the decoder depending on a realization ofy. Letd(m,\\hat{m})be the distortion of\\hat{m}relative tomandR(\\cdot)be the rate distortion function ofmwith respect to the distortion measured. Denote byP_oandN_othe available average signal power and the noise power level, respectively. We show thatE_{\\tau} \\geq (2 N_o / P_o)R. (Ed(m,\\hat{m}))and henceEd(m,\\hat{m}) \\geq R ^ {-1} (P_o E_ \\tau /2N_o ).. That is, given the average distortionEd(m,\\hat{m}), the average transmission time required can be no smaller than(2N_o/P_o)R(Ed(m,\\hat{m})). Conversely, given the average transmission timeE_{\\tau}, the average distortion can be no smaller thanR ^ {-1} (P_o E _ {\\tau} /2N_o)."
"The generalized Shannon lower bound to the rate-distortion functionR(D)for stationary sources with memory is extended to a wide class of distortion measures involving no symmetry conditions. The lower boundR_{L} (D)is a reasonably simple function of the entropy and marginal probabilities of the source and the per-letter distortion measure. Sufficient conditions only slightly less general than necessary conditions are given for the existence of a strictly positive cutoff distortionD_csuch thatR(D) = R_{L} (D)forD \\leq D_c. The sufficient conditions are the most general to date and include all previously known examples. This provides a nearly complete resolution of the question of when the Shannon-type lower bound to the rate-distortion function of a source with memory is tight. The results are applied to generalize earlier results for balanced distortion measures and Markov sources to nonbalanced distortion measures and wide-sense Markov sources. As a special case, it is shown thatD_c > 0for all finite-alphabet autoregressive sources. As an example,R_{L} (D)is evaluated for the first-order ternary autoregressive source for a balanced (Hamming) and a nonbalanced (modular distance) distortion measure. A simple lower bound toD_cis derived for this example."
"Generally, the synthesis of coherent spatial filters is restricted to the linear region of the transfer characteristic of a photographic film. However, a technique of synthesizing a nonlinear spatial filter such that the signal detection may be optimum will be described. In this paper, a generalized linear optimization technique is formulated. The application of this optimization technique toward a simple nonlinear spatial filter is demonstrated, and the extension of this optimization technique for a more complicated nonlinear spatial filter is also given. The signal detection by nonlinear optimum spatial filtering is analyzed. Finally, it is concluded that, instead of restricting the spatial-filter recording to the linear region of the transfer characteristic of the photographic film, an optimum nonlinear spatial filter may be achieved."
"This paper is concerned with stochastic-approximation algorithms for estimating signal parameters. Emphasis will be on the performance of the algorithm for a finite number of observations as opposed to the asymptotic convergence rate. We use as an upper bound a result due to Dvoretzky. A lower bound on the average mean-square error is derived. This new bound is based on the Cramér-Rao inequality. The conventional Cramér-Rao bound is not directly applicable, because it requires the knowledge of the bias function, which is difficult to find in a recursive estimation scheme. To avoid this difficulty, we introduce the concept of most favorable bias function and use the calculus of variations to derive the lower bound. The new bound also serves as a standard to judge the merits of the stochastic-estimation algorithm, since under some general conditions no estimate can yield smaller error. It is shown that under some conditions the two bounds are nearly equal, and hence the algorithm is near optimal. The asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm is compared with Sakrison's result. A stochastic-estimation algorithm is derived for estimating Doppler frequency, and performance curves in terms of the error bounds are presented."
"Signals transmitted over certain randomly time-varying linear channels undergo spreading both in time and in frequency. This paper considers a particular class of doubly spread channels: those with an impulse response that can be represented as the output of a distributed linear system, the dynamics of which are governed by partial differential state equations driven by a white noise process. The model is shown to include channels characterized by wide-sense stationary scattering (WSS), uncorrelated scattering (US), or both (WSSUS). When reception takes place in white Gaussian noise, the optimum, quadratic detector can be realized as an estimator-correlator. For the doubly spread channels encompassed by the model, the causal least-squares estimator of the channel response is obtained in the form of a linear filter with a distributed-parameter state-variable description. Certain error probability bounds and approximations can be evaluated upon solution of the receiver equations. Numerical results are given for an example: binary frequency-shift-keying (FSK) signaling over a particular WSSUS channel. The effects of the channel's frequency-time spread factor (BL) and the signaling interval on the optimum receiver performance, as measured by the Bhattacharyya distance, are investigated."
"If the nearest neighbor rule (NNR) is used to classify unknown samples, then Cover and Hart [1] have shown that the average probability of error usingnknown samples (denoted byR_n) converges to a numberRasntends to infinity, whereR^ {\\ast} \\leq R \\leq 2R^ {\\ast} (1 - R^ {\\ast}), andR^ {\\ast}is the Bayes probability of error. Here it is shown that when the samples lie inn-dimensional Euclidean space, the probability of error for the NNR conditioned on thenknown samples (denoted byL_n. so thatEL_n = R_n)converges toRwith probability 1 for mild continuity and moment assumptions on the class densities. Two estimates ofRfrom thenknown samples are shown to be consistent. Rates of convergence ofL_ntoRare also given."
"In this paper, we study discrete-time stationary sourcesSwith memory. The rateR(\\beta)of the source relative to a distortion measure is compared withR^ \\ast (\\beta), the rate of the memoryless sourceS^ /astwith the same marginal statistics asS. We show thatR^ \\ast (\\beta) - \\Delta \\leq R(\\beta) \\leq R^ \\ast (\\beta), where\\Deltais a measure of the memory of the source. A number of interesting applications of these bounds are given."
 "The enumeration of the incorrectly decoded bursts for cyclic burst error-correcting codes is reported here. The enumeration yields closed formulas for long bursts, whereas an efficient algorithm for the enumeration is given for the short bursts. The enumeration is carried out for two different decoding rules. Under the first rule, the cyclic code is a full length code, and split decodable patterns are decoded by the decoder in spite of the fact that a split decodable pattern can be a burst that exceeds the decoding capability of the decoder. The analysis for the second rule assumes split patterns are not decoded. This analysis is valid for the class of shortened cyclic codes."
"A procedure is defined for coding the binary symmetric first-order Markov source with the probability of error fidelity criterion. Since the rate-distortion functionR(d)for this source has not yet been formulated, the coding performance provides an apparently tight upper bound forR(d)."
"This correspondence develops tools for comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of unitary transformations in signal processing applications. Performance measures for the tasks of optimal filters and optimal coding are exemplified, and measures of similarity among representations are proposed."
"In this correspondence a complete decoding algorithm for double-error-correcting binary BCH codes of lengthn = 2^m - 1is introduced. It corrects all patterns of one and two errors and all patterns of three errors that belong to cosets that have a coset leader of weight three. This algorithm is based on the step-by-step decoding algorithm introduced by Prange and the decoding algorithm introduced by Meggitt, which makes use of the cyclic properties of the code. A comparison between this method and previously existing ones is also given."
"In this correspondence a new decoding algorithm using majority logic is proposed. This scheme, called \"pseudostep orthogonalization,\" is basically a hybrid version of the existing majority-logic decoding methods, namely, Reed-Massey's algorithm and Rudolph's algorithm. An example is given for the (21, 5) binary cyclic code, which can correct up to four independent errors."
"Much of the redundancy in a speech or television signal is eliminated when it is encoded into digital form by a differential pulse-code-modulation (DPCM) encoder. Additional coding of the DPCM output using entropy coding techniques (Huffman or Shannon-Fano coding) can result in a further increase in the signal-to-quantizing-noise ratio of 5.6 dB without increasing the transmission rate."
"A bound and construction are presented for high-rate burst-error-correcting recurrent codes. The bound is an upper bound on the block length in terms of the total redundancy used in decoding, the redundancy per block, and the burst length. The construction uses a block-code parity-check matrix as the first block of the recurrent code parity-check matrix. For a block code it is typical to find that only a portion of the redundancy need be used to detect a burst. Any block code for which this is true can be used in the construction. The recurrent code is then related as follows to the block code from which it is constructed. 1) The recurrent code block length is the same as the block-code block length. 2) The total redundancy used in decoding the recurrent code is the same as the block-code redundancy per block. 3) The recurrent code redundancy per block is the same as the block-code redundancy required for burst detection only. 4) The recurrent code is of higher rate than the block code. 5) The recurrent code requires a guard space between bursts but otherwise corrects the same bursts as the block code. It is shown that, when certain well-known cyclic codes are used in the construction, the resulting recurrent codes are close to the upper bound."
"The burst-trapping error control technique developed by Tong [1] corrects both random and burst errors adaptively. A generalization of this scheme, called generalized burst trapping (GBT), is presented here. Generalized burst-trapping codes (GBTC) also correct both random and burst errors adaptively but, in addition, are capable of correcting random errors in the guard space following a correctable burst. This added capability is obtained at the expense of a longer guard space or a lower rate and a modest increase in complexity of implementation. Nevertheless, these codes are simple to encode and decode and, in particular, the storage-saving technique used with the original burst-trapping codes is directly applicable to the generalized codes. Also it is shown that at most one block of error propagation can occur if a simple and reasonable condition is met. Thus the generalized codes have better propagation properties than the original burst-trapping codes. This new error control technique is well suited to error correction on channels where it cannot be assumed that bursts are isolated events separated by error-free intervals. Thus, for example, this technique appears well suited to error correction on telephone facilities that incorporate multiple-level signaling."
"One of the simplest, yet most effective schemes thus far devised for the correction of errors on compound channels is the adaptive decoding scheme invented by Gallager. In this paper we present a generalization of this scheme which, at a modest sacrifice in rate, enables the decoder to correct a burst even when the guard space following the burst contains random errors. This is accomplished with the use of two convolutional codes,CandC^ {\\ast}, whereC^ {\\ast}containsC. At the encoder, the information sequence is first encoded withCand then, after a fixed delay, is encoded with a \"shortened\" version ofC^ {\\ast}, which is added to the parity sequences ofC. At the decoder there are two modes of operation, a random mode and a burst mode. In the random mode errors are corrected withCin a manner similar to that of the Gallager scheme. In the burst mode, the information bits in the bursty blocks are recovered from the later blocks where they have been superimposed on the parity bits. In this mode a decoder forC^ {\\ast}, which precedes the decoder forC, removes random errors from these later blocks, thereby greatly increasing the probability of recovery from the burst."
 "An upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of an estimator-correlator receiver is derived, and the nature of the transmitted signals and random channels that realize this bound is investigated."
"The structure of a class of rate\\frac{1}{2}convolutional codes called complementary codes is investigated. Of special interest are properties that permit a simplified evaluation of free distance. Methods for finding the codes with largest free distance in this class are obtained. A synthesis procedure and a search procedure that result in good codes up to constraint lengths of 24 are described. The free and minimum distances of the best complementary codes are compared with the best known bounds and with the distances of other known codes."
"This paper presents an algebraic technique for decoding binary block codes in situations where the demodulator quantizes the received signal space intoQ > 2regions. The method, referred to as weighted erasure decoding (WED), is applicable in principle to any block code for which a binary decoding procedure is known."
"Every admissible linear decision boundary for the two-class multivariate normal recognition problem is known to be a hyperplane that is tangent to two tangent ellipsoids at their point of tangency. The ellipsoids are equiprobability surfaces for the distributions describing the classes. In this correspondence, the locus of tangent points is parameterized in a manner similar to that of Clunies-Ross and Riffenburgh.^1Anderson and Bahadur's work2 is then used to indicate which points on the locus give rise to admissible linear decision boundaries. A simple geometric proof is given for the characterization of admissible linear decision boundaries as tangent hyperplanes."
 "For an arbitrary band-limited generalized functionH(t)a representation is obtained that is a combination of a Taylor series and a conventional sampling series. A parameterNthat enters can be chosen such as to make the series rapidly convergent. Furthermore, it is shown that, for suitably restricted test functions,H(t)can be represented by a conventional sampling series and by a series of delta functions with weights equal to the sampling values. The results apply also to ordinary band-limited functions."
"A class of lower bounds for the generalized mean-square error (MSE), the probability of error, and the accuracy of domain decisions is derived. The derivation is based on the well-known properties of the functional \\begin{equation} \\Lambda \\equiv \\int _ {\\mathcal{H}} - [\\ln p_2 (x) - \\ln p_1 (x)]p_1(x)d \\gamma. \\end{equation} The bounds depend on the mutual information between the channel's input and output signals and on the loss of information due to making the decision. It is shown that further bounding of mutual information gives as special cases bounds for the generalized MSE. These special cases almost coincide with a special case of the we!l-known Shannon bound, which is based on information rate relative to a fidelity criterion, and with a special case of the Cramér-Rao bound. The derived bound for the probability of error and the accuracy is valid both in the continuous case, in particular for interval decisions and in the discrete case for list decisions. In another special case the bound turns out to be the well-known Fano bound. The problem of the uniqueness of the derived bounds is also considered and it is shown that in a certain sense they are unique bounds based only on mutual information. As by-products a new extremal property of the entropy and a uniqueness property of functional\\Lambdaare proved."
"This paper contains an analysis of the performance of Bayes conditional-mean parameter estimators. The main result is that on a finite parameter space such estimates exhibit a mean-square error that diminishes exponentially with the number of observations, the observations being assumed to be independent. Two situations are discussed: true parameter included in the parameter space and true parameter not included in the parameter space. In the former instance only very general assumptions are required to demonstrate the exponential convergence rate. In the latter case the existence of an information function must be invoked. Comments on the continuous-parameter-space realization of the estimator and a discussion of the convergence mechanism are also included."
"The Schwarz inequality is used to derive the Barankin lower bounds on the covariance matrix of unbiased estimates of a vector parameter. The bound is applied to communications and radar problems in which the unknown parameter is embedded in a signal of known form and observed in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Within this context it is shown that the Barankin bound reduces to the Cramér-Rao bound when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large. However, as the SNR is reduced beyond a critical value, the Barankin bound deviates radically from the Cramér-Rao bound, exhibiting the so-called threshold effect. The bounds were applied to the linear FM waveform, and within the resulting class of bounds it was possible to select one that led to a closed-form expression for the lower bound on the variance of an unbiased range estimate. This expression clearly demonstrates the threshold behavior one must expect when using a nonlinear modulation system. Tighter bounds were easily obtained, but these had to be evaluated numerically. The sidelobe structure of the linear FM compressed pulse leads to a significant increase in the variance of the estimate. For a practical linear FM pulse of 1-\\mu sduration and 40-MHz bandwidth, the radar must operate at an SNR greater than 10 dB if meaningful unbiased range estimates are to be obtained."
"This paper considers the solution of a Fredholm equation occurring in detection theory problems. A solution procedure, based on solving differential equations with nonmixed boundary conditions, is described for the case when the kernel of the integral equation is known to be the output covariance of a linear finite-dimensional system excited by white noise. Solutions with discontinuities are considered."
"In this paper a class of system identification problems of nonparametric type is considered. Specifically, given an unknown deterministic system, some basic structural aspects related to the problem of estimating its weighting function are discussed. The model adopted for the system input-output relation is general enough to cover a number of situations ranging from problems of identification of linear time-invariant systems to those where the system is nonlinear and time varying. The emphasis is on establishing what, in principle, can be recovered of the system weighting function through a noiseless identification process and the ultimate limitations imposed by the presence of observation or measurement noise."
"In a multiple-target environment a radar signal processor often uses weighting filters that are not matched to the transmitted waveform. In this paper the mean-square range-estimation error, the detection Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the effects of sidelobes are expressed in terms of the impulse response of an arbitrary mismatched filter. It is desired to find that impulse response that results in the minimum range-estimate variance subject to preassigned constraints on the side-lobes and the detection SNR. It is shown that for detecting the radar target and estimating its range, the form of the optimum filter is a modified transversal equalizer. If only detection is required, the optimum filter reduces to the transversal equalizer. Certain parameters upon which the solution depends can be found by solving a nonlinear programming problem. Numerical results are given for an interesting class of transmitted waveforms."
"Adaptive algorithms for designing two-category linear pattern classifiers have been developed and studied in recent years. When the pattern sets are nonseparable, the adaptive algorithms do not directly minimize the number of classification errors, which is the usual goal in pattern classifier design: furthermore, they also are not minimum-error optimal, i.e., they do not generally minimize the probability of error for the classifier. However, the least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive algorithm has been shown to yield classifiers that are asymptotically minimum-error optimal for patterns from Gaussian equal-covariance distributions. A technique is also known for designing asymptotically minimum-error optimal linear classifiers for patterns from Gaussian distributions with unequal covariance matrices. This paper shows that classifiers designed with the \"error-correction\" algorithms have these same asymptotic properties: the error-correction algorithms are asymptotically minimum-error optimal for patterns drawn from Gaussian equal-covariance distributions and they can be used to design asymptotically minimum-error optimal linear classifiers for patterns from Gaussian distributions with unequal covariance matrices. In addition, because the error-correction algorithms use only part of the patterns in determining the classifier weights, they are asymptotically minimum-error optimal for patterns from distributions that have only Gaussian tails in the regions where their patterns are misclassified or close to misclassified, and that are almost arbitrary elsewhere."
"It is shown how nonsystematic Reed-Solomon (RS) codes encoded by means of the Chinese remainder theorem can be decoded using the Berlekamp algorithm. The Chien search and calculation of error values are not needed but are replaced by a polynomial division and added calculation in determining the syndrome. It is shown that for certain cases of low-rate RS codes, the total decoding computation may be less than the usual method used with cyclic codes. Encoding and decoding for shorter length codes is presented."
"Consider a stochastic system with output Y whose probability density (pY \\mid \\Lambda) is a known function of the parameter \\Lambda whose true value is unknown. Our aim is to assign a prior probability density  b(\\Lambda) for \\Lambda using all the available knowledge so that we can assess the probabilistic behavior of Y from the corresponding marginal density q(Y). Usually the range of \\Lambda is known. In addition, by considering the distribution of \\Lambda in similar systems, we can define the density f(\\Lambda), about which we may have some knowledge such as E(\\Lambda _ 1 ^ {2}) \\geq 1/2, etc. We derive an expression for the uncertainty functional \\phi(\\cdot) involving f(\\Lambda) andb(\\Lambda) to quantify the discrepancy between the actual behavior of Y and our assessment of its behavior. We pose a two-person zero-sum game with\\phias the payoff function so thatb(\\Lambda)is chosen by us to minimize\\phi, whereas f(\\Lambda)is chosen by nature to maximize \\phi. We derive an asymptotic expression for the prior density, work out a few examples, and discuss the advantages of this method over others."

"Pulse transformers capable of transmitting substantially rectangular voltage pulses, with durations of less than one microsecond, were developed for radar applications during World War II. Their primary functions were to match the impedances of high-power microwave radio-frequency electron-tube generators to electronic pulse generators and coaxial transmission cables, and to provide polarity reversal and impedance matching functions within pulse generator circuitry. The principle contributor to the development of satisfactory pulse transformers was the development of cores of thin-gauge magnetic materials having 1 μs pulse permeabilities in the range of 500 to 3500 for flux-density changes of 10 000 G. The development of void free dry-type insulation systems made it possible to produce dry-type pulse transformers for operation at pulse voltages below 12 kV. The pulse transformer development work was paralleled by analytical work which enabled pulse transformer designers to make designs to meet the requirements of the radar circuit designers. The analysis relates the three principle pulse transformer parameters, which are magnetizing inductance, leakage inductance, and effective distributed capacitance, in combination with the circuit parameters which are source resistance, effective load resistance, and load shunt capacitance, to the rise time, top ripple and droop, and fall time of the output pulse. Pulse transformers now cover a wide range of sizes and power levels and pulse widths. Small units in computer applications may deliver only a few volts at pulse widths less than 0.1 μs. Large units in linear accelerators, however, may deliver pulse powers of 70 MW at 270 kV with a pulse width of about 3 μs."
"The amplitude and distribution of the external fields emanating from recorded transitions are of great interest to technologists in the field of information storage and retrieval and, more particularly, to those studying alternate readout techniques to the conventional inductive readout method. Such areas include the magnetic transfer process, Hall probe techniques, and the magneto-optic and Lorentz beam readout techniques. In this paper we used a harmonic analysis simulation of the non-linear digital recording process, and calculated the amplitude and distribution of external bit fields for a wide range of media magnetic properties and thicknesses, and as a function of bit density and spacing above the surface of the media. Justification for using the harmonic analysis model is based upon the good agreement obtained with the reported spatial behavior of the external bit fields measured directly by a scanning electron microscope. In addition, calculations based on simpler models of a line, step, and linear transition show that the harmonic model is a superior first-order approximation of the nonlinear nature of digital magnetic recording."
"The hard axis magnetic field distribution within the uniaxial magnetic film element of a thin film memory device is calculated. In the memory device considered, the driving stripline and magnetic film are located between a magnetic keeper and a conducting ground plane. The difficulty encountered in the keeper-ground plane problem arises from the requirement of satisfying boundary conditions at the keeper and ground plane surfaces simultaneously, or in other words, from considering an infinite set of film and stripline images. A method of solution using Fourier transforms proves satisfactory. The dependence of the magnetic field distribution on the relative position of the elements and on variations in material properties is assessed."
"This review of the saturation magnetic recording process is tutorial in approach. The emphasis throughout is on the development of intuitive understanding as well as the development of a first-order analysis (good to 10-20 percent) of the process. By means of treating two different functional approximations to the magnetization distribution in the medium, linear and arctangent, it is shown that the peak output voltage and half-amplitude pulse width of a transition are nearly independent of the distribution. Thus good estimates of these important system parameters may be made without reliance upon a specific model. It is made apparent that head-to-medium spacing and effective-medium thickness are of dominant importance in system density considerations."
"The principal soft ferromagnetic materials in use today are still iron and silicon-iron alloys. Factors affecting magnetic properties of importance in practical use are evaluated and related to properties attainable in iron and electrical steels. Developments in metallurgy and technology leading up to the present status of com-merical materials in the principal categories of iron, low-carbon steel, nonoriented silicon-iron and grain-oriented silicon-iron are described. Improvements in magnetic properties have been achieved primarily by minimizing chemical impurities and controlling crystal orientation. The relation of material properties to applications is discussed and an evaluation of possible future developments is made."
"The basic readout and write-in characteristics of NDRO analog memory elements composed of electrodeposited Permalloy wires were reported previously by the authors. The output signal was the second harmonic voltage of the interrogation sinusoidal-wave field (225 kHz) applied along the hard axis, and the amplitude was proportional to the product of the set flux level and square of the interrogation field. This report deals with some details of the write-in characteristics, linearization of write-in characteristics by a negative feedback circuit, and readout of the stored flux level by a fundamental component of the induced voltage, selection schemes are also discussed for practical use."
"A four-transistor circuit is described for a battery operated magnetometer that has 0.1γ resolution using 1-in diameter 4-79 or 6-81 Mo-Permalloy tape cores of 20-40 Mx capacity. The center-tapped drive winding also serves as the sense winding, simplifying the sensor assembly. Some signal-to-noise results are presented to illustrate the fairly wide difference that may exist between cores of the same cross section and to demonstrate the advantage of reducing core area."
"Eddy currents in tape-wound cores are classified into microscopic and macroscopic eddy currents. The latter, denoted by ie, exists during mode II among three switching modes. Inherent peak\\dot{\\phi}versusFfor a highF = F_{D}drive is computed from measured\\dot{\\phi}_{m}(F_{D})and\\phi_{m}(F_{D}), the\\dot{\\phi}and φ when\\dot{\\phi}is maximum. The expected line density of reversed-domain nucleation centers is computed from\\phi_{m}(F_{D}). A switching tape-wound core is equivalent to one with \"ferrite-core\" characteristics that is loaded by a resistanceR_{e} = \\dot{\\phi}/i_{e}. A special computer program was developed to computei_{e}(\\phi,F_{D})andR_{e}(\\phi,F_{D}), the higher FD, the wider and lower the resulting U shapedR_{e}(\\phi). Domain-pattern models are proposed. Accordingly,n_{p}(\\phi,F_{D})domains in which\\phi \\cdot p(\\phi,F_{D})is generated are encircled by macroscopic eddy currents wheren_{p} \\geq 0and1 \\geq p \\geq 0. The semiempirical modelR_{e}(\\phi,F_{D}) = R_{ez}(F_{D})/{1 - [\\phi/\\phi_{m}(F_{D})]}, where Rezis Reat\\phi = 0, is proposed. The functions describing\\phi_{m}(F_{D})andR_{ez}(F_{D})include a total of five parameters besides."
"A very high resolution Bitter pattern technique is used to observe the motion of Bloch walls in Permalloy films excited by slowly rising and slowly falling hard-axis fields. For low coercive force films, the basic motion consists of approximately equal and opposite jumps induced by simultaneous wall structure changes at two transition fields. Net motion begins with the application of small easy-axis bias fields. For high coercive force films, although the wall structure changes continue to occur, the wall jumps and a net displacement do net occur until the easy-axis bias field exceeds a certain critical value which is a function of the wall coercive force."
"A technique of stroboscopic observation has been applied to the examination of the dynamic behavior of cylindrical magnetic domains, in a single crystal platelet of Sm0.55Tb0.45FeO3, propagating around a closed path Permalloy film T-bar structured overlay. Domain propagation is achieved by means of the time-varying magnetic pole configuration induced by a rotating magnetic field in the plane of the Permalloy film. Semiquantitative measurements under conditions of continuous propagation show instantaneous wall velocities varying from almost zero to greater than six times the time-averaged domain velocity. The speed of propagation in this T-bar structure is limited by the design of the comer where domains become trapped. The stroboscopic technique used here should find important application in the dynamic evaluation of designs for domain-propagation structures."
"The phenomenon of magnetostriction, or the change in a body's dimensions during the magnetization process, was first reported by Joule. Since then, the interaction between strain and the magnetization process has been studied extensively, particularly in the magnetic metals and alloys that have been found to be of technological importance. The purpose of this paper is to review magnetostrictive phenomena in metallic materials and to discuss a number of devices making use of magnetostriction. After presenting some fundamentals of magnetostriction, a review is given of magnetoelastic effects and magnetoelastically induced anisotropies in magnetic films. Some of the domain patterns and domain visualization techniques that have been found to be related to the magnetostrictive properties of magnetic materials are discussed. The application of magnetostrictive materials to memory devices is reviewed. Included are such areas as magnetostrictive delay lines, ferroacoustic memories of both the flat film and wire type, thermo-strictive recording, and fiat film displays and display memories."
"Multidomain ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for Permalloy magnetic fills (thickness 2700 Å) 83 percent Ni with rotatable anisotropy was experimentally observed with an external magnetic field applied normal to the sample surface. The lower frequency branch of multidomain FMR was excited when the RF magnetic fieldhwas oriented along the film plane; forhoriented parallel to the fieldH_{\\perp}the higher frequency branch was excited. The dependence of the resonant fieldH_{\\perp}on the frequency of fieldhfor multidomain and single-domain FMR was determined. Increasing the RF fieldhoriented alongH_{\\perp}gave rise to oscillations of magnetization with the frequency(1/2)f, wherefis the pumping frequency. The dependence of the amplitude of these oscillations on the strength of the RF fieldhand on the magnetizing fieldH_{\\perp}was investigated."
"A process for applying coatings to conductive materials by means of electrophoresis has been used for coating ferrites on printed circuit conductors as a magnetic keeper material for cylindrical thin film wire memories. This process is also known as electrocoating when used in this manner. The advantage of this process is the ability to obtain consistently a uniform coating of predetermined thickness and density on parts of any configuration. Another feature of this process is that good adhesion of the ferrites to the conductor is obtained. This is accomplished by use of a heterogeneous nitrogen resin as a suspension media for ferrites in an electrocoating bath The thickness of the coating increased with voltage and the density of the ferrites in the coating was dependent upon the concentration of ferrites in the coating bath. The denser the ferrites the higher the permeability. Word straps on a small piece of tunnel structure were electrocoated. Evaluation of these coatings were made in a cylindrical thin film tester. The keepered word straps had a much wider operating margin and a lower write threshold than unkeepered word straps. Complete units were then selectively keepered by this process and tested. These units were compared to those keepered with ferrite sheets and without keepers. The results of these tests indicated an overall improvement in the performance of the discrete keepered wire memory, i.e., lower word drive current, lower write threshold, improved adjacent bit disturb threshold, and increased output voltage with noise and cross talk levels of the discrete keeper lower than those with sheet keepers."
"A new method of measuring the losses in saturated solid magnetic cores subjected to alternating magnetization is described. The method is based on the measurement of an alternative Poynting vector in the region between the surface of the iron core and the magnetizing winding. The two constituent components of this power-flow vector are the partial electric field and the magnetic field. A brief description of suitable probes for measuring these two field components and the associated measuring circuit is given. Loss measurements are made on two cores, a long rod, and a toroid; the results are compared with those calculated using analytical and numerical methods and also with those predicted by linear electromagnetic theory."
"Ferrimagnetic resonance line width in slowly cooled and quenched samples of polycrystalline NiFe2O4has been measured in theXband in the range 4.2 to 373°K. Results confirm that the porosity contribution to the line width is best described by the relation\\Delta H_{p} = [K.4 \\pi M/(V/\\upsilon) + 1)]withK = 1, though this overestimates\\Delta H_{p}in certain cases. The anisotropy contribution to the line width according to Schlömann is\\Delta H_{a} = C \\cdot H_{a^{1}}/4 \\pi M, withC \\cong 2.07whenH_{a}\\ll 4M. But our results show thatCdepends upon the sign of K1. ForK_{1} < 0, C = 2.5and forK_{1} > 0 , C \\cong 1.2in range180 Oe \\leq K/M \\leq 360Oe. For very low values ofK_{1}/M,Cdeviates very much from 2, and particularly so forK_{1} < 0. The effect of K2is shown to be negligible. Hence the result is interpreted in terms of an effective anisotropy field which takes into account the magnetoelastic energy as well."
"Design equations for the most commonly used ferroresonant regulators and regulated rectifiers are derived. Expressions relating the physical size of the components and the short circuit characteristic of the circuit to the output power, frequency, input power factor, and voltage levels are developed. Frem these expressions, design equations that optimize the design are obtained and specific component values are recommended. For regulated rectifiers, the design of the filter and the effect of the filter on the design of the basic regulator are discussed. The effect of deviating from the recommended values and the effects of nonlinearities not considered in the derivations are discussed, Design examples and data are presented."
"The aim of this paper is the analysis of dry reed relay with a special stress put on the possibility of closing without bounces. The assumed mathematical model is the case with one degree of freedom. Three dimensionless parameters have been introduced. They fully characterize the dynamics of the relay, and at the same time simplify the form of the differential equation. When this equation is being analyzed on the analog computer, one obtains the condition of bounceless operation of the dry reed relay. These conditions are related with dimensionless parameters, which is very convenient in practice since they are very easy to measure. The obtained theoretical results have been confirmed by experiments described in this paper."
"Results on Co-P films are presented which show a strong correlation between film coercivity and grain size, providing the latter is appropriately interpreted."
"The common physical basis of the Mossbauer effect (ME) and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods is shortly reviewed by discussing the relevant physical properties of nuclei and the interactions of atomic nuclei with electric and magnetic fields. A survey is given of the measurement methods. In principle all those properties of materials can be measured by ME and NMR which influence the energy levels of atomic nuclei and change the shape and intensity of ME and NMR spectra. These properties include the magnetic hyperfine field present in magnetically ordered materials, the valency state of atoms influencing the charge density at the nucleus, the local symmetry of the neighborhood of an atom resulting in electric field gradients at the nucleus, etc. Macroscopic properties connected with these microscopic properties are the magnetization, the magnetic, electric and structural order of crystals, lattice imperfections, and size, shape, and texture of crystallites. Most of these physical properties are closely related to the magnetic properties of matter. Both ME and NMR are limited to specific isotopes and therefore only special groups of' materials are accessible for investigation by these methods. Extensive data about NMR investigations on these materials in the last five years and complementary information about ME investigations on these materials are presented in tabular form and are discussed for selected examples."
"Metallurgical efforts to develop a soft magnetic material suitable for application in the rotor of a generator or motor in advanced aerospace electric systems are reviewed. Commercial materials which have been considered include AISI 4340 steel, H-11 steel, Nivco alloy, and 15- and 18-percent Ni maraging steels. Developments described have led to several new materials with combination of good mechanical and magnetic properties at elevated temperature. Such materials include an improved maraging steel a precipitation hardenable cobalt-base alloy, a carbide strengthened Co-W alloy, dispersion-strengthened soft magnetic alloys, and unidirectionally solidified Co-Nb-Fe eutectic alloys."
"During the past two decades, improved understanding of the fundamental magnetic behavior of Fe-Ni alloys has made them one of the most versatile class of soft magnetic materials. No longer is the concern limited to high permeability and low coercfve force at room temperature. Alloys have now been custom-crafted to meet high permeability requirements at cryogenic temperatures, exhibit a skewed hysteresis loop for pulse transformer use, or a square hysteresis loop combined with stress insensitivity and controlled coercive force for memory applications. These examples are discussed in terms of the relationship of magnetic properties to structure and composition in Fe-Ni alloys."
"A brief résumé of basic magnetism is followed by a consideration of the magnetization process in the absence of applied mechanical stress, in which the importance of internal stresses and inclusions is emphasized and which leads to the introduction of Néel's disperse field theory. The Rayleigh laws are interpreted in terms of \"Preisach loops.\" Early work on the influence of stress on the magnetization process is discussed, leading on to a detailed consideration of this phenomenon in terms of three mechanisms which, for simplicity, are taken to be essentially distinct. These are, first, the alteration of the pressure on 90° domain walls by the application of stress; second, the alteration in the opposition term, which must clearly be in balance with this pressure for domain-wall equilibrium, and, finally, large-scale alterations in the overall domain structure. Existing experimental observations, on both magnetically soft and hard materials, are interpreted in terms of these three mechanisms."
"A YIG disk with parallel and polished surfaces was bonded onto a quartz rod with a transducer attached to it. The YIG sample was placed in a microwave cavity in a parallel-pumping configuration. For microwave power several decibels above the threshold for spin-wave instability, parametric generation of low-frequency acoustic waves was observed, and was accompanied by the simultaneous appearance of low-frequency modulation of the microwave reflected power. The effects were attributed to the beating of spin-wave side bands with the central band. The existence of side bands was confirmed by measuring the spin-wave spectrum. In the mode-locking experiment, a low-frequency acoustic wave was sent into the YIG sample through the transducer. Experimental evidences show that the acoustic wave, through magnetoelastic coupling, not only locks the phase but also enhances the amplitude of the sidebands relative to the central band."
"In ferrimagnets, under a dc magnetic field, magnon-phonon coupling can result in such effects as acoustic birefringence and Faraday rotation. From our work on acoustic Faraday rotation in nonellipsoidal samples of YIG, we found three regions of rotation. The low field region has an internal magnetic field insufficient for effective phonon-magnon conversion. Fitting the rotation observed to the theory we find values for the second magnetoelastic constant and the average demagnetizing field. Between the low and middle field regions a decrease in the amplitude of the transmitted elastic wave was observed and attributed to spin-wave losses. The middle field region was characterized by conversion of elastic energy into spin waves. Regions of inefficient conversion were observed. Faraday rotation was again observed in the high field region."
"A new type of integrated magnetic recording head has been developed. The head is made completely from thin films by vacuum deposition through a mask. This technology enables us to make many heads in one vacuum cycle. A special study has been carried out on the geometrical forms and on the anisotropic magnetic material. The demagnetizing fields require that we make magnetostatic coupling layers for each magnetic leg of the head. Also, the results indicate that the heads can be used for writing and reading."
"A new type of reproduce transducer for reading magnetically recorded tapes is described. The device structure, which utilizes the magnetoresistive effect in a thin magnetic film deposited onto a nonmagnetic substrate, provides wavelength response characteristics comparable to existing technology. Indigenous noise effects are subordinate to tape noise. No intrinsic frequency limitations are experienced for recording bandwidths in existence today. Since the device detects the tape's fringing fields directly, the output is not a function of tape velocity. The device construction lends itself nicely to multichannel head assemblies. The transducer may also be used to detect digitally recorded information."
"Fine particles of cobalt and an iron-cobalt alloy were prepared and encapsulated in a plastic film to protect them from oxidation. The magnetic properties of the coated powders were determined and compared with the properties of coated iron powders studied previously. The thermal degradation of magnetic properties was also investigated. Polymer-coated iron and cobalt powders were incorporated in a Hypalon rubber matrix to obtain additional magnetic property data and to study recording characteristics. The experimental materials exhibited better high-frequency response in magnetic recording than a standard γ-Fe2O3material, and one material had a higher signal output as well."
 "A computer simulation is described which uses the approximation that the output voltage derives from longitudinal tape magnetization acquired solely from the longitudinal head field. Using a simple noninteractingM_{r}-Hmodel, the remanent state of 200 points per half-wavelength of tape is calculated by following each point's field history as it passes the record head. We discuss the amplitude and phase angle of the magnetization sinusoids obtained by harmonic analysis. At short wavelengths (wavelength less than coating thickness) we find, for regular γ-Fe2O3tape, that although the peak output is limited by record head field gradient effects, the over-recording phenomenon is attributable to the field shape. The process of \"optimizing\" the record current is thus shown to be explicable in terms of the record head field geometry. These conclusions hold equally for \"partial penetration\" recording of high density digital waveforms."
"The signal-to-noise ratio of a magnetic tape reproduce system is discussed. An expression for the theoretical value of the signal-to-average-band-limited-noise is developed in terms of the statistical properties of the signal and the probable noise sources. The concept of power spectral density is used to simplify the discussion and to develop insight into system behavior. The resultant system equations are then recast in terms of the physical properties of the system to demonstrate the effects of materials construction geometry, and electronics noise on the SNR. The theoretical discussion is correlated with experimental data for verification."
"The theory of the motion of magnetic particles in a viscous Newtonian medium, first outlined by Newman and Yar-brough, has been extended to include both low and high field orientation modes. It is shown that the equations of motion can be solved analytically, i.e., without resort to numerical integration. The results of the analysis are used to predict values for easily measured parameters of recording media, such as the initial remanence ratio and squareness ratio."
"The origin of magnetic anisotropy of thin films deposited at oblique incidence is investigated. Electron micrographs of such films prepared at various incident angles demonstrate a characteristic particle structure. A model of the film developed on this basis is composed of identical elongated rotation ellipsoids whose long axes are oriented parallel to the beam direction. The energy densityFis calculated for all orientations of magnetization, taking into account the shape anisotropy of the particles and the interaction of their stray fields. Hence the anisotropic properties of the film are obtained. The comparison of calculated and experimental results verifies the assumption that anisotropy is caused preferably by effects of shape induced by technological processes. The parameters of films with optimal storage properties (maximum energy product) can be determined theoretically by the suggested method."
"A new measurement technique using a bandpass filter structure, called a filter-orienter, allows determination of magnetic properties of single crystal ferrimagnetic samples at arbitrary crystallographic directions. Materials properties can be conveniently measured over several octaves in field and over a considerable temperature rang. This technique was utilized to examine the ferromagnetic resonance thermal compensation axes of YIG and GaYIG spheres. An optimum thermal compensation axis was found which for GaYIG is an order of magnitude more stable over a multi-octave field range than the thermal compensation axis usually identified in the {110} crystal plane. Experimental results were explained by ferromagnetic resonance theory wheng-factor temperature dependence, propagation scattering, and other frequency perturbation effects were included."
"With the increasing use of ferrites in microwave integrated circuits, it becomes important to determine the temperature stability of the effective values of dielectric constant and unmagnetized permeability of ferrites in this application. This paper reports the results of such measurements on several ferrites. The test samples were slabs 2 × 0.5 × 0.032 in. In order to provide a basis for understanding the intrinsic properties of the ferrites, the slabs were tested first by completely copper plating the sample except for an iris at each end. The resonant frequencies of the samples were measured at room temperature and at an elevated temperature, first without a bias field, then with a bias field. From the measurements, data were obtained on the intrinsic dielectric constant and the unmagnetized permeability, and their temperature coefficients. Formulas are given to calculate the effective values from the intrinsic values. The original plating was then removed and the sample replated as a microstrip line. The magnetic filling factor was obtained from measurements on the microstrip line."
"Since the development of high-energy product Sm-Co magnets, ring type Sin-Co magnets have been producted for TWTs at Raytheon. A direct correlation between hysteresis loop measurements and the functional measurements made on the periodic permanent magnet (PPM) stacks of TWT ring magnets is highly desirable. A vibrating sample magnetometer which is capable of measuring theB-Hloop directly on ring magnets has been developed. A correlation between the measuredB-Hvalues as compared to the measured values in PPM stacks is presented. The PPM stacks are normally given a stabilizing thermal treatment at a temperature as required by the operating conditions of the TWT. It is shown that for a given thermal treatment, the higher the intrinsic maximum energy product -(4π MH)max the higher the axial field as measured in PPM array."
"Co-rare earth permanent magnets generally display a high intrinsic coercive force. In order to make magnetic measurements with such materials fully saturated, we have found it necessary to use magnetizing fields in excess of 50 kOe. The superconducting solenoid is ideally suited for generating such fields. In this study, we have used a 100 kOe Nb3-Sn superconducting solenoid for magnetizing samples and for measuring saturation magnetization. Demagnetization properties of long cylindrical samples have been measured in the superconducting solenoid, and also with a conventional hysteresigraph after the samples have been saturated with the superconducting solenoid or in some cases with a pulsed field solenoid. Short disk samples or ring magnets such as are used in traveling wave tube (TWT) designs are difficult to measure by these techniques. We have found torque magnetometry to be useful for such shapes. Open circuit magnetization is measured in this case. Results for ring magnets will be compared with peak axial field measurements for a periodic TWT structure. Reversible and irreversible changes in magnetization with temperature are also of interest. Techniques for measuring these changes are discussed."
"A family of sintered Co-rare earth alloys utilizing Sm, Pr, La, or Ce mischmetal has been developed. Each alloy is designed to optimize one of the following characteristics: 1) Magnets which exhibit magnetic energy products in excess of 20 MG . Oe; 2) Magnets which exhibit reversible demagnetization behavior in adverse fields up to 14 000 Oe; 3) Magnets using inexpensive rare earth metals to maximize the magnetic energy per unit cost. These alloys should extend the range of use of Co-rare earth magnets for microwave devices."
"In a dc motor with permanent magnet stator, the mean no-load working point of the magnet material can, after stabilization by stall current, be represented by a pointB_{m},H_{m}on a recoil line inside the demagnetization curve. The point results from the application during stall of an effective mean field Hadue to armature reaction in addition to the self-demagnetizing field due to circuit reluctance. It is shown that the motor specification and sizes lead to a specific value forH_{m}/H_{a}. The limiting values of this ratio (Hmzero or Hazero) imply that the corresponding optimum magnet designs for minimum magnet volume should be based either on maximum recoil energy or on(BH)_{max}. In practice, the best extreme working point during stall should lie between the points for these two criteria, dependent on the actualH_{m}/H_{a}. In some existing motorsH_{m}/H_{a}has been found to be between 0.5 and 1.5. For such values ofH_{m}/H_{a}, the variation of Bmand ofB_{m},H_{m}with working point is illustrated for high coercivity ferrite and for two grades of cast alnico alloy. A note on design methods is appended"
"Conventional voltage sharing networks for series-connected thyristors have serious deficiencies with forced commutation. It is shown that great improvement in turn-off performance over that attainable with the usual shunt resistive and capacitive components can be achieved by using an additional series saturating inductor, transformer(s) connected across the thyristors, or a combination of these. The latter methods pose a severe insulation problem and methods of reducing this are described. Sufficient reasoning is given to form a design basis for the arrangements considered and justifying experimental results are quoted. These methods of voltage control, while applicable generally to series operation of thyristors, are mainly aimed at future applications of long strings of thyristors to high-voltage invertors and choppers."
"The diffusion of stray magnetic fields into conductors is modeled. By considering only the perpendicular axis of a planar magnetic film, then by assuming a rectangular approximation to the stray flux density, the analysis is greatly simplified while identifying the dominant aspects of the interaction. Use of analogous RC transmission line equations permits the representation of instantaneous film switching by the step-response of an electric circuit, which facilitates the estimation of dominant time constants."

"The critical field strength at which a classical domain wall moves through a perfect ferromagnetic crystal of simplified structure is calculated as a function of the ratio between anisotropy energyKand ferromagnetic coupling energyC, taking into account the discrete nature of the spins. WhenKapproachesCintrinsic wall pinning becomes appreciable with critical fields approaching the anisotropy field whenK \\gg C. ForK/C \\geq 2/3, the wall has a thickness of one atomic distance and thus resembles a ferroelectric wall."
"The behavior of the coercive force of two Fe-Ni alloys with 51 and 72 percent Ni as a function of plastic strain was studied, both with a static tensile stress applied and released. It was found that the coercive force depends on the interaction between dislocations and 180° domain walls when the tensile stress was applied, and therefore increases linearly with the square root of the strain. When the tensile stress was released, however, the coercive force showed an anomalous behavior: it increased rapidly at the beginning of the plastic deformation up to maximum, then decreased or remained constant."
"A magnetic memory is described that can be produced by batch fabrication techniques in some respects similar to those developed for the production of semiconductors. Drive requirements and sense signals are such as to make this approach completely compatible with integrated circuits. Production and operation of the device is explained and the functioning of a complete memory system is discussed."
"We have extended the self-consistent calculation of a magnetic transition recorded on a thin film disk to where the head has been removed. The calculated transition width is compared with experiment and its functional dependences on the magnetic parameters of the medium are compared with previous theories."
"A technique is described for producing anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) in situ on an endless loop tape recorder. A comparison of noise from ARM with dc noise, arising from room temperature isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) is presented in the form of demagnetization curves. By these methods, tape properties can be studied under conditions simulating \"ideal\" ac biased recording."
"Magnetically coupled thin films have proven useful in the development of high density NDRO magnetic thin film memory devices. This communication reports the variation in magnetic properties of both films comprising the film pair as a function of the interlayer thickness."
  "The magnetization process in contact printing is considered to be the same process as an ideal anhysteretic magnetization process. In the anhysteretic magnetization process a self-demagnetization effect by an internal field is an important factor, especially at short wavelength. Therefore, the internal field effect should be evaluated dynamically depending on the instantaneous strength of the diminishing bias field. It was shown that such an anhysteretic magnetization process including the internal field effect can be represented as a first-order feedback system in an automatic control theory. Thus the numerical analyzing method for the anhysteretic magnetization was established, and excellent coincidence between the numerically computed result and the experimental result in the contact printing was obtained. Consequently the distribution patterns of the magnetization and the internal field in the duplicated tape was computed."
"H_{c), J_{s}, and Jrwere measured on Ni-Fe-Mo films at low temperatures. As the temperature dropped from 300 to 80°K, the Hccoercive field of Ni-Fe-Mo films with 0 percent content of Mo decreases from 1800 to 680 A/m. On the contrary, for the films with 5 and 10 percent Mo, the Hcincreases. The magnetization Jsvaries with temperature in the same sense as Hc. From the curvesJ = f(H/T)atT_{1} = 300\\degK andT_{2} = 80\\degK, it is found that the Ni-Fe-Mo electrolytic films with a concentration of over 10 percent Mo present properties characteristic of the superparamagnetic state."
"A two-transfluxor analog memory is described. It uses single coincident-current pulses on separate signal and bais windings to store a flux level analogous to the input signal sample in about 10 μs. An additional winding senses the set flux level and permits further linearization of the storage characteristic by means of negative feedback."
 "Performance of magnetic film memory arrays is limited by various disturb mechanisms that can completely erode written information if the array design inadequately provides for process variations, strip line attenuation, power supply variations, etc. This paper reports on several particularly relevant disturb mechanisms in coupled-film closed-easy-axis (CFCEA) arrays [1] intended for large capacity NDRO multiple-write bulk memory application. Two new design guidelines for densities\\gsim 25 000bit/in2are presented: 1) minimization of creep sensitivity to alternating interrogate and bit disturbs and 2) prevention of the formation of uncoupled interbit domains. Both can be achieved by mismatching the effective coercive fields of the coupled films in the same ratio as the applied easy-axis fields."
"Foils of 4-79 molybdenum Permalloy have been measured for permeability-frequency characteristics as a function of heat treatment and foil thickness for frequencies up to 30 MHz. The slope of the permeability-frequency curve was found to be -0.7 instead of the -0.5 expected from classical theory. The low-frequency permeability of foils thinner than 0.5 mil decreases rapidly with decreasing thickness. This decrease may be connected with changes in texture, surface roughness, or grain size, all of which were observed."
"Some of the factors which affect domain structures in magnetic materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy include crystal perfection, nonmagnetic or weakly magnetic inclusions, and the nature of grain boundaries. In whisker-like barium ferrite crystals about 3 μm in thickness straight (180°) domain walls were observed in the basal plane. Reverse domains did not nucleate at fields of over -5000 Oe after first saturating the crystals in a positive magnetic field. In less perfect crystal platelets of about the same thickness the domain structures form in what may be described as a convoluted pattern, and after saturating in a positive magnetic field, reverse domains nucleate in positive fields of from +100 to +1000 Oe. An analysis of the convoluted patterns has shown disclination structures of several types. The influence of internal defects as well as the effect of surfaces, nonmagnetic inclusions, and grain boundaries on domain structures in magnetic materials with high crystalline anisotropy are described and discussed."
"The thermal variation of lattice parameters of rare earth-transition metal intermetallic compounds rich in Fe, Co or Ni in the temperature range of 25-900°K is studied. For the Fe compounds, negative thermal expansion is observed below their magnetic ordering temperatures regardless of the nature of substitutional ordering. For Co and Ni compounds, the thermal expansion behavior is normal. It is then concluded that for the Fe compounds, the magnetic properties are mainly determined by the Fe-Fe interatomic distances and the number of Fe nearest neighbors, whereas for Co and Ni compounds the magnetic properties are determined by the conduction electron transfer from the rare earth to the3dband of Co or Ni, The anomalous thermal expansion of Fe compounds and the metamagnetic transition of the Lu compound is explained in terms of the distance dependence of the interaction energy as proposed by Néel."
"The Stoner-Wohlfarth coherent rotation model has been extended to particle sizes approaching the superparamagnetic critical size Scfor the case of barium ferrite. It is shown that at particle volumes up to100 S_{c}, the coercivity factor will be lower than the Stoner-Wohlfarth factor of 0.48. Experimentally, micro-powders of barium ferrite with variable particle size have been formed using the glass-ceramic process. The particle size was determined with X-ray and electron microscope techniques. Although coercivities in excess of 5000 Oe were measured, the comparison between experiment and theory is not good. This has been attributed to the fact that the particles are poorly crystallized even though formation proceeded by a precipitation and crystal growth process."
"The magnetic behavior of single particles of Co5Sm is being studied in an effort to understand the origin of the coercive force in cobalt rare earths. It has been found that the complex hysteresis loops often observed, containing several magnetization discontinuities, can be analyzed as the linear sum of single-discontinuity hysteresis loops, implying that regions of a particle can act magnetically independently."
"In order to investigate the magnetization process in hard-magnetic RCo5compounds (where R = Y, Ce, Pr and Sm), their magnetic domain structures were studied in the demagnetized state and in different magnetized states in an external magnetic field. The domains in small (10-100μm) RCo5particles were revealed using the magnetooptic Kerr technique. The observed domain structure is typical for a hexagonal material showing high crystalline anisotropy and having its direction of easy magnetization parallel to thecaxis. Demagnetized particles even as small as 10 μm consist of a few domains. The demagnetization process of an initially fully magnetized particle thus proceeds by nucleation and subsequent growth of domains of reversed magnetization. We have observed the nucleation and growth of reverse domains in SmCo5and YCo5particles under the action of an external magnetic field."
 "Using a film of doped europum oxide as a storage medium, a disk memory has been demonstrated. Since the Curie temperature of this material is approximately 150°K, liquid nitrogen temperature (77°K) was chosen as the operating point for the disk assembly."
            "The nondestructive readout (NDRO) capability of 2.2- mil diameter wires has been examined for Permalloy films 700- 4000 Å thick. The substrates were prepared by deposition of Cu and Au to produce a number of different combinations of grain sizes and metal exposed on the surface. The Permalloy was deposited onto these substrates from a sulfate bath containing various concentrations of thiourea. The results show that the substrate parameters controlling the NDRO quality of plated wires are roughness, grain size, and metal exposed. A combination of Au islands on rough Cu greatly enhances all NDRO characteristics. With decreasing Permalloy thickness, the NDRO characteristics on an optimum substrate become poorer. With decreasing concentrations of thiourea in the Permalloy deposition bath the properties improve. These results are discussed in terms of a phenomenological model based on composition fluctuations in the Permalloy which result in local high-anisotropy regions. The distribution of anisotropy is controlled by the composition fluctuation and stress, while the coupling between regions is controlled by the grain size. These high-anisotropy regions, which are exchanged coupled to the remainder of the film, retain the original information and provide the restoring torque needed for NDRO performance."
"To obtain lower drive requirements and higher densities, plated-wire memory must use thinner films on smaller diameter substrate. The memory element characteristics of thin (1000-3000 Å) Permalloy film on 2.2-mil tungsten wire substrate are reported here. Nondestructive readout as well as destructive read-out properties and the effect of a simple keeper structure will be described. The determination of a valid test program in terms of pulse aud Belsen tests will also be discussed."
"A technique is described for the preparation of fine particle rare earth orthoferrites in a wide range of compositions. These compositions include those containing a single rare earth, multiple rare earths, single and multiple rare earths with excess iron or excess rare earth, and these same combinations with partial substitution of iron with cobalt. The technique is relatively simple and involves a precipitation and decomposition of the precipitate in a muffle furnace."
"Nonmagnetic optical birefringence for light propagated along the direction of magnetization can be reduced to low levels in orthoferrite compositions such as NdxPr1-xFeO3. This results in a significant improvement in Faraday rotation detection of magnetic domains in thin single crystal orthoferrite platelets. For a simple two polarizer detection scheme, one can obtain light transmitted in the ON state of 10-20 percent of the incident light for contrasts between the ON and OFF states of greater than 20/1, for He-Ne laser light at\\lambda = 0.633 \\mum and for platelet thicknesses of 0.001- 0.003 in. The low birefringent orthoferrites can be used in optical memory and display devices employing mobile magnetic bubble domains or reversible localized domains which act as binary optical shutters."
"Magnetic bubbles have been reported in bulk grown, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) garnets, implying the existence of noncubic anisotropies in all of these materials. Anisotropy magnitudes, directions, nonuniformities, and annealing behaviors and effects of strain relief on the anisotropies of several potentially useful garnet materials are presented and compared. These observations indicate that the noncubic anisotropies in the bulk materials and LPE films are similar, and are consistent with the pair-ordered model. Annealing reduces the growth induced anisotropy of LPE films and may be useful for increasing wall mobility, decreasing coercivity, and altering bubble sizes to match circuits."
"A partially populated model of a 10-million-bit magnetic-film memory was tested at 0.36 μs access time and 0.9-μs cycle time. The integral word conductor enclosed by magnetic film was formed by evaporation and plating with 200 000 bit on each substrate. Digit lines were made by laminating sheet copper onto 50-in long glass substrates and scribing into lines. The use of rigid substrates for both the word and digit lines gave low parasitic noise. The design required a keepered digit line; several different configurations were demonstrated to provide adequate closure. Cost per bit was reduced from an earlier design through sharing of the sense circuit by 32 000 bit and simplification of the digit line balance circuit."
"A new digital magnetic temperature transducer is reported. The device utilizes the discontinuous behavior of the initial permeability with temperature at the Curie temperature of some magnetic materials. Since the Curie temperature is determined by the chemical and crystallographic composition of the particular material only, the transducer requires no calibration and has extremely high stability and reproducibility with time. The output of the transducer is inherently digital and, therefore, is directly compatible with the digital information processing and control without A/D conversion. The temperature-sensing portion of the transducer consists only of magnetic cores and wire and, therefore, has extremely high reliability, is shock and radiation insensitive, small, and virtually indestructible."
"In order to eliminate the tedious task of measurement and data plotting in the design of an inductor having a specified minimum inductance at a given level of direct current, two computer programs have been developed. We need only to determine the effect of magetizing force on the permeability of a sample closed core with no air gap. One computer program accepts this information and generates the characteristics of a variety of uniform core sizes, displaying the results by means of a plotting routine. Another program, using the same information, accepts requirements in terms of minimum inductance at a specified direct current and calculates the number of turns, wire size, and necessary air gap for as many as ten suitable configurations."
"A dispersion technique is shown which prepares powdered (particulate) materials for measurement in a 60-Hz hysteresis loop tracer (B-Hmeter). The material is proportioned and wet out with linseed oil in a Hoover Automatic Muller, packed in a glass tube, and weighed. The space gradient of an ac magnetic field is used to orient the sample to a high squareness ratio. The only two physical measurements which need be made are the weight and the length of the mixture in the tube. The tube cross section need not be determined. The absolute intrinsic flux density of the material can then be calculated, using the flux determination from the hysteresis loop tracer. If the tube cross section is determined, the apparent flux density can be calculated."
"Stable magnetic bubbles have been formed and propagated in films of mixed terbium erbium iron garnet, grown by chemical vapor deposition on substrates of samarium gallium garnet and mixed samarium gadolinium gallium garnet. Smooth films were obtained with growth rates of 2-5 μm/h. A 20-μm period Y-bar circuit was deposited on a film of approximate composition Tb2.5Er0.5Fe5O12on a Sm3Ga5O12"
"Yttrium iron garnet films were deposited by chemical transport using a solid Fe2O3source and an additional YCl3vapor delivery. Layers deposited on GdGaG were epitaxial. At the low deposition rates employed, substitution of substrate by film components was observed. The deposition method was applicable also to rare-earth garnets; GdIg and DyIG were prepared."
"The development of an electronic wattmeter for use in power circuits with very low power factors and nonsinusoidal waveforms is reported. The wattmeter is constructed of commercially available components which include a high-accuracy electronic multiplier and appropriate amplifying, averaging, and compensating circuitry. It is a portable laboratory instrument with provisions for direct reading of both instantaneous and average power. A thermal standard has been used to calibrate the wattmeter over a wide range of current pulse magnitudes and pulsewidths and at power factors down to 0.01. Several applications of power measurements in typical solid-state power controller circuits are discussed."
"A new hysteresis loop tracer (B-Hmeter), operating at 60 Hz, has been developed for use in the quality control of magnetic materials for magnetic recording. The instrument is suitable for making hysteresis measurements of hard magnetic materials with coercivities ranging from about 2.5 Oe (200 A/m) to 2.5 kOe (200 kA/m), which can be saturated (or nearly so) in fields up to -5.5 kOe (450 kA/m). Materials may be tapes, rods, or packed tubes. Precise measurements may be made by relatively untrained personnel. The pertinent specifications are as follows : 1) maximum applied field (Hm) to 5.5 kOe (450 kA/m) ; 2) sample flux range from 50 mMx (0.5 nWb) to 1 kMx (10 μWb) ; 3) direct digital readout of Hm, coercive force (Hci), maximum flux (\\varphi_{mi}), remanent flux (\\varphi_{r}), and loop squareness (box$^b$); 4) X-Y plotting of the hysteresis loop, the differentiated loop, orH_{ci}, \\varphi_{mi}, \\varphi_{r}, box$^b$, etc., versus Hm; 5) precision of flux and field measurements to the order of 1 percent. Contributing to the performance is a novel main coil design which generates a field constant to within 0.5 percent in a volume containing the sample and the pickup coils. The electronics package makes extensive use of analog function modules to process the signal information."
"In anhysteretic contact printing, a high-frequency transfer field is used to promote the acquisition, by a low-coercivity slave tape, of information prerecorded on a high-coercivity master tape. The slave tape is thus magnetized anhysteretically in the fringing field of the master and its own demagnetizing field. The slave tape magnetization and output voltage may be obtained by solving an integral equation. For master tapes of normal output, the integral equation is linear, and an exact closed-form solution for the slave tape output voltage valid at all wavelengths is presented; the contact printing efficiency exhibits the - 6 dB/octave loss at long wavelengths known previously and, for the first time, the specific dependency of slave tape output on its anhysteretic susceptibility. With master tapes of substantially greater than normal output, nonlinearities become significant and-results of numerical solutions are given. Some of the factors governing the choice of transfer field direction, magnitude, and decrement are discussed. Finally, since anhysteresis and thermoremanence are known to be similar processes, the theory is shown to be adaptable immediately to thermoremanent contact printing."
"The anhysteretic contact printing process was simulated by a computer with the Preisach diagram which was modified by the Onsager field effect. The printed magnetization was determined by successive magnetizations at each peak of the decreasing transfer field. The second quadrant demagnetization was also discussed afterward, but the effect of the reproducing head was not included. The actual magnetization will be situated between the magnetization before and after the second quadrant demagnetization. As a result of the simulation, considerable saturation was found at the surface layer of the printed tape when the input signal intensity of the recorded master tape becomes large. The transfer efficiency decreases rapidly, corresponding to the increase of the signal field intensity. These results show qualitatively good agreement with experimental results published heretofore."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"The hypothesis that in orthoferrites walls parallel to theaaxis are Bloch walls while walls parallel to thebaxis are Néel walls is investigated by measuring the wall-energy anisotropy as a function of the quality factorqby varying the temperature of the sample. One of the methods of measuring the temperature dependence ofquses vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Also, a simple method for obtaining the temperature dependence ofqand the material characteristic length using an isolated bubble domain without collapsing it is described. It is found that at high temperatures, whereqis large, the wall-energy anisotropy increases asymptotically to approximately 3.8 percent of the average wall energy, presumably due to a difference in exchange interactions aloug different crystalline axes. The measurements seem to verify the predicted dependence of wall-energy anisotropy onqand the hypothesis."
 "Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
 "An analysis has been made of the number and types of logical functions which can be performed using the interaction of circular magnetic domains in rare earth iron oxides. Multiple logic functions are found to be produced simultaneously at any logical area. These conjunctive output sets have been categorized. Several conjunctive logic gates have been designed, fabricated, and tested successfully in Sm0.55Tb0.45FeO3using Permalloy overlays. Utilizing a circuit in which AND/OR logic gates are coupled to a dynamic memory bank, the total correlation of two data streams has been performed. It is shown how this multiply accessed dynamic memory serves to establish the correlation threshold."
"Hot-pressed ferrites have been studied in connection with fabrication of a high quality head material. A two-step hot-pressing technique has enabled the preparation of hot-pressed ferrite with a porosity lower than 0.1 percent and an adjusted average grain size between 0.1 μm and 500 μm. The largest available ingot of hot-pressed ferrite is 120 mm in diameter and 20 mm in thickness. A hot-pressed Mn-Zn ferrite with an adjusted microstructure can be made with a μmof 40 000 and an Hclower than 0.02 Oe. A hot-pressed Mn-Zn ferrite of another composition will have a Bmgreater than 5000 G and a μ0of 700 at 10 MHz. The effect of mechanical working on magnetic properties of hot-pressed ferrites, single-crystal ferrites, and high-density ferrites is also described. The lapping characteristics and the wear problems in a ferrite head of hot-pressed, single-crystal, and high-density ferrite are also discussed."
"A reference pattern and control system were examined for specifications given to automatic train stop position control equipment for Japan's Expo'70 site. A constant braking instruction was given after a train passed the final landmark, and the train was proportionally controlled to trace pattern 1 (deceleration 2.8 km/h/s) and pattern 2 (deceleration 1.5 km/h/s). A high-reliability automatic operation control equipment was developed by using magnetically controlled transistor logic elements. Field tests satisfied specifications for controlling action and stopping accuracy. Practicability of the system was proven by operation results for six months."
"Fairly large sized Mn-Zn single crystals with growing axis nearly parallel to"
"Polycrystalline MnZn and NiZn ferrites suitable for recording-head applications have been prepared by pressure sintering (hotpressing). General conditions for pressure sintering and details of the apparatus are described. Also discussed are the effects of grain size and temperature, in the normal range of glass bonding, on the magnetic and physical properties of pressure-sintered MnZn ferrite. It was observed that the strength of the ferrite increased with decreasing grain size in the range studied (15 to 500 μm). An opposite effect was noted for resistance to material wear. Increases in permeability up to 30 percent were obtained by relieving residual machining stresses with anneals in the 500 to 900°C range. Similar increases in strength were observed for low-temperature anneals. However, at temperatures higher than 500°C, the strength was reduced strongly, with the amount of the reduction being dependent upon the surface finish of the ferrite and its geometry. In general, strength was reduced with coarser surface finish and increasing surface-to-volume ratios. Data on material wear and hardness as functions of grain size and composition are presented. Improvement in performance of video recording heads fabricated of pressure-sintered MnZn ferrite as compared to Alfesil and single-crystal MnZn ferrite is also demonstrated."
"Cylindrical magnetic domain (CMD) propagation actually comes to the generation of magnetostatic traps (MST) which successively \"capture\" the domains on their way along the propagation path. There are three types of MST which correspond to three types of magnetostatic interactions between a domain magnetization and \"active\" elements of propagation circuits. An interaction of CMD magnetization with ferromagnetic overlay (the third type of an interaction) can generate MST with the maximum depth of approximately 16 Oe. NIST depth in practical propagation circuits is bound to be 6-10 Oe. The data rate upper limit for the techniques using the interaction of CMD and ferromagnetic overlay is determined by the minimum time interval necessary for domain capture by MST and for orthoferrites, which is approximately 1 Mbit/s. The rare-earth orthoferrite single crystals synthesized by the floating zone technique were used throughout the experiments."
"Experiments and calculations are reported about some aspects of the repulsive interactions of cylindrical magnetic bubble domains. Experiments were done on hexagonal lattices of bubbles in which, for one case, the stable positions of the bubbles were determined by a Permalloy overlay. The calculations refer to different structures and Show that from a point of view of bubble interactions the maximum bubble density for a square lattice is almost the same as for a hexagonal lattice. It is also shown that a preferred thickness of the bubble material sheet exists."
"The ferromagnetic properties of manganese antimony (MnSb), in contrast to the corresponding compounds of arsenic and bismuth, do not show instabilities associated with first-order phase transitions near the magnetic ordering temperature. However, the magnetic properties of the manganese-antimony system are sensitive to the presence of interstitial cations. For example, Mn1+xSb phases have been reported (0 < x < 0.2) with Curie temperatures varying between 300 and 90°C. Although MnSb is free from first-order phase changes, bulk samples of Mn1.2Sb were found to be magnetically unstable on thermal cycling through their Curie temperature. Repeated thermal cycling resulted in a shift of the Curie temperature from 90 to ∼300°C ; a value typical of stoichiometric MnSb. Lattice constant and magnetization measurements are consistent with this magnetic aging being associated with the migration of manganese ions away from the bipyramidal interstices in which they are known to couple antiferromagnetically with the octahedral lattice site manganese ions. Polycrystalline films of stoichiometric MnSb were prepared by RF sputtering and were shown to have optical absorption and Faraday rotation comparable to isostructural MnBi. Attempts to prepare films of Mn1.2Sb with a Curie temperature of 90°C always resulted in material with the magnetic properties of stoichiometric MnSb, and lattice constant data strongly suggest that we were unable to populate the interstitial cation sites in the films."
"Domain-wall velocity was measured for vacuum-deposited permalloy films in the thickness range of from 310 to 3000 Å. The dependence of the velocity on drive field amplitude was non-linear for all of the forty-two films. The ν-H characteristics were clearly separated into two regions (low and high field), except for the thick films ( > 2500 Å). The high field regions were fairly linear, and the interpolated lines intersected theHaxis at much lower fields than the coercive force and often at the origin. The wall mobilities that were determined from the slope of the high field regions were found to be about one third of the mobilities reported by other authors. These were compared with the theoretical value and found to be in fair agreement. As one of the characteristics of wall motion under fields lower than the coercive force, the mean-free-path of a wall was measured as a function of the easy axis field."
"An experimental optical memory system is described for evaluating the optical memory characteristics of MnBi films. The preparation procedure for obtaining large uniform films is discussed. These films require about 10 mW of laser power to write 1-μm bits and a coincident field of 600 Oe to erase them. A packing density of 1.5 × 108bit/in2with a typical signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is readily achieved. Large area films have been sample tested and found to be of usable quality over 99.9 percent of the area. Test bits have been repeatedly cycled to the Curie point more than 106times retaining an adequate signal-to-noise ratio."
"Polycrystalline films of Fe5Si3have been prepared by RF sputtering from a sintered target composed of 62.5 at% Fe and 37.5 at% Si. The Faraday rotation and optical absorption were measured for these films in the visible and near infrared. At a wavelength of 6328Å, room-temperature absorption (corrected for reflection) and specific Faraday rotation are 3.7 × 105cm-1and 1.3 × 105deg/cm, respectively. The rotation decreases with rising temperature and vanishes around 120°C, the Curie temperature of the films. From polar and in-plane hysteresis loop measurements the spontaneous magnetization is found to lie in the film plane. Square hysteresis loops are observed when the external field is applied in the plane of the film, and the in-plane coercive force decreases monotonically with temperature at an average rate of -2 Oe/°C as Tcis approached."
"Hot-pressed CdCr2S4has been prepared which has high optical quality in the infrared. The absorption coefficient and Faraday rotation have been measured in the wavelength range between 3 and 15 μm. The absorption coefficient was measured both spectrometrically, which includes absorption and scattering, and calorimetrically at 10.6 μm with a CO2laser, which measures only the absorption. At 10.6 μm both methods give a value of about 3.5 cm-1, indicating that scattering is not important. The Faraday rotation measurements agree essentially with those found for single-crystal CdCr2S4by Wittekoek and Bongers. At 10.6 μm and 80°K the rotation is 120 deg/cm at 6.5 kOe, giving a figure of merit of about 7.5-deg rotation per dB absorption. Therefore, application of this material to magnetooptical devices may be possible using liquid nitrogen as a coolant."
      "The measurement of magnetic fields over audio and video magnetic recording heads and tapes was achieved with a stroboscopic electron mirror microscope which had some attachments for image scanning and readout of current density distribution at the final screen. The curves obtained were processed on a digital computer. This made it possible to calculate the distribution of magnetic fields at any height over the surface of the specimen. The frequency response curves of audio and video recording heads were measured in the range of 0-10 MHz. The magnetic field distribution of sinusoidal and video recorded signals on the tape was also measured at various heights over the tape."
 "The write field of multilayered integrated heads has been computed avoiding the usual assumptions that the head contour is an equipotential surface, by starting from the effect of the coil field on the magnetization of the layers. The magnetic analysis assumes that the magnetization of each layer curls near the head boundary, and it is shown that this curling significantly affects the write-field distribution. Experimental measurements are in good agreement with these theoretical results, and it is shown that integrated heads produce a write field whose magnitude is comparable to that of classical heads."
"Magnetic tape recorders have long been used on satellites and spacecraft for onboard storage of large quantities of data. As satellites enter into commercial service, long operating life at high reliability becomes important. Also, the presently planned long-duration space flights to the outer planets require long-life tape recorders. Past satellite tape recorders have achieved a less than satisfactory performance record and the operating life of other spacecraft tape recorders has been relatively short and unpredictable. Most failures have resulted from malfunctions of the mechanical tape transport. Recent advances in electric motors and static memories have allowed the development of a new tape recorder which uses a very simple tape transport with few possible failure modes. It consists only of two brushless dc motors, two tape guides, and the recording heads. Relatively low tape tension, wide torque capability, and precise speed control facilitate design for mechanical reliability to match that of tape-recorder electronics."
 "A vapor-deposited thin-film recording head and a unique reading technique are described. The head structure used for both write and read is similar to that of the Mated-Film memory element. Conventional longitudinal recordings at 4000 flux reversals per inch have been written with a thin-film head in 300-Å-thick iron films having a coercivity of 80 Oe. Conventional longitudinal recordings up to 1600 flux reversals per inch in thin-film media and in oxide media have been sensed with the thin-film head. Although a one-turn sense line is used, flux amplification is obtained because the head magnetization, not the flux from the recording, is sensed. This also results in an output signal that is independent of recording media velocity."
"A theory of cylindrical domains is presented for cases of a single domain in a plate of finite extent and of many domains scattered at random in a plate of infinite extent in the plane. Force and stability functions are determined for both cases. New unexpected solutions showing stability without a bias field, as well as those, for which the bias field must be directed in compliance with the magnetization in the cylindrical domain, are obtained. It is proved that the neglect of finite plate dimensions, as well as of the interaction between domains, is the cause of the apparent dependence of energy density of the domain wall on the bias field as stated in other reports. Theoretical considerations are proved by the experiments on the domain structure carried out on YFeO3orthoferrite."
"Single-crystal gadolinium iron garnet films, grown epitaxially on yttrium aluminum garnet substrates, have a stress induced easy axis of magnetization normal to the film plane. This uniaxial anisotropy was measured and found to agree with values expected from differential thermal expansion between film and substrate. Wall creep experiments show that flux reversal occurs by wall motion at fields about one-fifth the rotational switching threshold. A model, describing magnetization reversal under quasi-static conditions, is derived from such experiments."
 "Development of DRO plated-wire memory elements and tests in a 60-ns cycle-time memory of 26 000-bit capacity are reported. The experimental memory was fully populated with wire, but partially populated with electronics. Noise conditions of a full memory were simulated. The destructive readout (DRO) cycle utilized a single digit pulse as opposed to the bipolar digit pulses normally used in nondestructive readout (NDRO) wire memories. High-speed DRO plated wire has been prepared in a continuous process. Two thin Permalloy layers separated by copper are electrodeposited on a specially prepared wire substrate. The laminate approach combines the high disturb resistance and fast write switching of thinner films with the signal magnitude of thicker ones. In sacrificing the NDRO feature, improved tolerance to strain and aging were also noted."
 "New polyphase signal generators of high reliability and simple construction are presented. The principle is based on the propagation of the reversed flux region in the saturable core controlled by switching operation of transistors. We use the ring core of a ferrite disk or metal sheets such as 50-percent Ni-Fe alloy, in which the flux reversal takes place from the inner to the outer periphery of the ring core due to the difference of the magnetic path length. We make small apertures in the core and arrange a suitable number of windings between the apertures. We obtain polyphase ac voltage from these windings when the saturable core itself is operated by switching transistors as in Royer's multivibrator. We discuss the methods of shaping of the output voltage waveforms. The same kind of polyphase signal generator is also possible with the tape-wound core."
"Micromagnetic nucleation theory determines the conditions under which an infinitesimal nonuniform deviation from uniform magnetic saturation (nucleation mode) becomes energetically favorable. A method is described for deciding whether such a nucleation mode remains small or has a tendency to grow spontaneously, i.e., whether nucleation is stable or unstable. Approximations are developed that permit a simple application of the theory to uniaxial films with the anisotropy type used in bubble-domain devices. With these approximations calculations can be carried out analytically, and explicit expressions are obtained for the nucleation stability range. The expected behavior of the incipient domain pattern is interpreted with the help of a free-energy surface whose topography reflects the micromagnetic nucleation theory."
"At certain ac input levels, discontinuous jumps appear in the ferroresonant regulator's steady-state output-versus-input characteristic. The conditions are derived under which this action, known as jump resonance, can occur. The describing function method of nonlinear system analysis is used to derive the range of circuit parameters in which the jump can occur. It is found that the conditions for the jump can be expressed in terms of the values of the linear energy storage elements and the character of the non-linearity, and that there exists a unit circle in the Nyquist plane which must be avoided to assure the nonoccurrence of the jump. The theoretical analysis is supplemented with a computer study of the circuit using an analog computer simulation program."
"Coercive field Hcand initial susceptibility\\chi_{i}of plastically deformed specimens of Fe-3.25-percent Si alloy are measured during isochronal and isothermal recovery at various temperatures. The isochronal behavior was studied between 100 and 800°C at intervals of 50° and the specimen annealed for 20 min at each temperature. The coercive field and the initial susceptibility remain constant up to about 200°C. Above this temperature Hcincreases to a maximum and then drops steadily below its original value with rising temperature,\\chi_{i}drops to a minimum with rising temperature and then steadily increases to above its initial value. The isothermal behavior shows that Hcincreases with recovery time at lower temperatures and then drops to lower values with annealing time. At higher temperatures the coercive field decreases with annealing time without exhibiting a maximum. The initial susceptibility drops to a minimum during the early stage of isothermal recovery at lower temperatures and subsequently rises to higher values. At higher temperature no drop is observed in\\chi_{i}."
"A constant-voltage power device is developed which, while similar to the well-known ferroresonant regulator, overcomes many of its limitations. The new controlled constant-voltage transformer employs switching devices and a dc electrolytic capacitor rather than the saturating core and ac capacitor of the ferroresonant regulator. Since the output is controllable, a dc feedback loop may be used to remove the effects of frequency changes, varying loads, etc."
"A new feedback-controlled ferroresonant voltage regulator employing a single magnetic structure is presented. By introducing an additional magnetic path through the use of a second set of shunts, all the magnetic functions are provided in a minimum volume. In this new circuit, instead of permitting saturation of the output section of the core, an external control circuit simulates core saturation and provides a means of obtaining precision regulation. This circuit retains all the advantages of ferroresonant regulators such as high reliability and simplicity; in addition it reduces the stray magnetic field and proves to be economical."
"Characteristics of magnetic-domain device (MDD) and charge-transfer device (CTD) memory modules which appear technically feasible and desirable for use in computer applications are derived. The possible uses of these memories in the memory and storage subsystems of computers are discussed. The concept and measures of performance of memory hierarchies is outlined and possible improvements by incorporation of MDD and/or CTD memories in hierarchies employing conventional memories are addressed. A scheme comprising two hierarchy levels on the same chip is evaluated by using the derived performance measures."
"A computer study of mode conversion in thin-film optical waveguides using magnetooptic GdIG as a substrate is reported. The efficiency of the mode-converting structure is analyzed and compared to other structures in order to gain design insight. It is shown that 100-percent mode conversion (TE\\rightleftarrowTM) is possible if both modes satisfy the phase condition required of mode propagation."
"Hand and computer methods are presented for calculating sensitivity figures of recording heads. Given a two-dimensional core configuration, the permeabilities of the core materials, the coil location, and the location of the gap(s), the head sensitivity may be computed in oersteds within the gap per ampere-turn of drive. The effects of field dependent permeability and leakage flux are included in the calculation. Experimental sensitivities measured from readback amplitudes from a digital disk file head match the calculated sensitivity to within 15 percent. Sensitivity figures may be used to determine the recording field intensity and the readback pulse, and may be related to inductance and to the electromagnetic uniformity of the head under dimensional and magnetic tolerances."
"A hysteresis model of partial flux reversal in a ferrite core under voltage pulsed excitations is proposed in order to explain the relation between partial flux sets and the memory characteristics of magnetic analog memories. The model is based on the assumption that the slope of the irreversible region declines in proportion to the reversed flux level. The recurrence equations for flux levels derived from the model explain the hysteresis phenomenon in the meomory characteristics."
"A transmission electron-microscope selected-area small-angle diffraction technique is used to measure field distributions near ferrite and thin-film magnetic recording heads. The limit of flux detection is the fluxon unit (4 × 10-7G.cm2). For a head height of 30 μm this allows a field precision of 10 Oe for a position precision of 10-5cm. Experimental results from ferrite and thin-film integrated heads are compared with the existing theories. Experiment shows principally that the head profile cannot be considered as a magnetic equipotential and that practical field gradients are lower than those predicted theoretically."
"Small (0.025-in diameter) capacitor probes mounted without shield rings in ceramic air-bearing sliders enable dynamic flying height measurements to be obtained in the 40- to 200-μin range for flying over aluminum disks protected with thin epoxy coatings. An absolute precision of 4 percent and a relative precision of better than 1 percent is realizable at a 60 μ,in height. Three probes per slider, monitored simultaneously, yield roll and pitch angle information in addition to height data. The measured height and pitch angle time-average values agree with those computed using Reynolds equation. Experimental calibration of the probes is in satisfactory agreement with a conformal-transform computed calibration. The probe technique has led to the development of a stable-flying slider of apertureless rectangular design."
"In practically all of the industrially developed countries of the world there are strong national standards organizations. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) coordinates and unifies electrical and electronic standards by drafting international recommendations from which member countries may draw for national standards. The benefits derived from this work include better understanding among electrical and electronic engineers and scientists, and a means for initiating and expanding international trade. The upsurge in development and application of ferrites led the IEC to establish a committee on ferromagnetic oxide parts 15 years ago, which rapidly expanded into a full technical committee on magnetic materials and components (TC 51). The magnetic activities include recommendations for terms and definitions, dimensional standardization, measurement methods, inductors and transformers, data storage devices, strip-wound cores and laminations, variability (temperature and time), gyromagnetic applications (microwave), and antenna rods. Eleven TC 51 IEC publications are now available. Numerous others are in process."
"The fringe field for magnetic recording heads of finite pole-tip length containing a current conductor in the pole-tip region of the gap is obtained using conformal mapping techniques. Isolated readback pulse data as a function of pole-tip length and related geometrical parameters are tabulated for typical parameter values of interest. \"All ones\" output voltage versus transition density is computed for pole-tip length equal to gap length and for infinite pole-tip length."
 "The garnet materials system has provided the basis for a rapid fundamental transformation of cylindrical magnetic bubble-domain materials technology from one based on bulk single crystals to one based on epitaxy. Recent developments are reviewed in an effort to provide some perspective on the nature of this transformation and its promise for exploitation. The intrinsic adaptability of the garnet system has permitted high degrees of substrate-epitaxial film lattice matching along with structural and chemical compatibility. As a result, it has been possible to grow liquid-phase hetero-epitaxial films with the ease and simplicity usually associated with homoepitaxy, while yet retaining the flexibilities of heteroepitaxial systems. These films thus exhibit only a few defects per square centimeter and have been used with 10 000-step shift registers. The rare-earth gallium garnet substrate growth capabilities are also described as well as chemical-vapor deposition epitaxial technology and its comparison with liquid-phase epitaxy."
 "An iterative hysteretic model is presented which calculates the magnetization distribution in a thin magnetic layer for digital recording systems. The model considers the effects of the head field, self-demagnetization fields, and induced image fields. A complete hysteresis loop model is also presented. Write-field asymmetry is observed. It is found that the inclusion of the image fields significantly sharpens the transition region."
"The fundamental practical factors of data recording by the modulation of focused spots formed by electron beams or by laser light are compared in terms of usefulness in applications for data storage and retrieval. The basic factors include: spot formation, focal sensitivity, noise, scanning speed, beam deflection, and media environment. As photographic recording systems, both have maximum utility for high-speed serial data recording and readout and less utility for rapid-access memories. In electron beam systems continuous data rates as high as 300 Mbit/s are feasible. Such rates will also be attainable in laser systems utilizing parallel track recording. Bit densities of 107/in2are possible with either system. A projected estimate of pertinent parameters is indicated."
"Recent developments in magnetic recording have made very significant improvements in digital storage density possible. A memory system with a capacity of 2 × 1012bit using a high storage density quad head recording technique has been announced. Storage density is limited by practical considerations of data reliability and mechanical tape/strip handling, as well as information-theoretical limits. Evolutionary improvements in data storage density, data rate, and system throughput may be expected during the next ten years."
"Thermomagnetic properties of fine-grain polycrystalline GdIG were investigated in two ways. First the hysteresis loop was observed on bulk material as well as on thin wafers over the temperature range 0-70°C. The remanent flux density Br, the squareness ratioB_{r}/B_{s}, and the coercive force Hcwere found to be quite temperature dependent. The effects of stresses and grain size on the Hcvalue were measured. These properties were explained in terms of domain-wall dynamics. A second set of experiments was the study of dynamic thermomagnetic laser recording on GdIG as a storage medium. The writing and reading parameters were examined. A bit diameter of 15 μm was currently written with 100-mW 1-μs pulses together with a 250-Oe bias field. Readout at rates of up to 106bit/s was obtained for densities larger than 106bit/in2. The stability of written bits was studied versus time or temperature changes and correlated with the magnetic properties."
 "The preparation techniques and the physical properties, including the structural, magnetic, magnetooptical, optical, and switching properties, of EuS films which are stoichiometric and Fe doped, are examined. Films were deposited onto heated substrates of fused quartz by vacuum evaporation of high-density EuS using an electron-beam gun. X-ray analysis shows polycrystalline structure with bulklike lattice constants. The ferromagnetic Tcranges from\\sim18\\degK for stoichiometric samples to\\sim45\\degK for Fe-doped films. The optical absorption peak, due to4f-5dtransitions, occurs at 0.51 μm with a typical absorption coefficient of 1.25 × 105/cm at 300°K. The maximum Faraday rotation occurs at 0.58 μm with a specific Faraday rotation of 3.1 × 105deg/cm for an incident angle of 65°. The coercive force decreases from 30 Oe at 5.2°K to 20 Oe at 10°K and to zero at\\sim15\\degK. In EuS films doped with Fe (up to 16 percent by weight) Tcis increased to\\geq45\\degK. The optical absorptiou is increased to 2 × 105/cm with the absorption peak shifted to 0.55 μm. Another outstanding feature is the square hysteresis loop. AtT < 6\\degK, the squareness is 0.9, and this extends almost to the Curie point."
  "A theoretical treatment is given of the anhysteretic contact duplication process for magnetic recording tapes. The treatment, which is completely analytical, is restricted to the linear approximation. Reversible permeabilities of both master and slave (which may be anisotropic) are taken into account. Both the longitudinal and the perpendicular components of the slave magnetization are taken into consideration, and it is shown that the presence of the latter significantly affects the results. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data, obtained from a large-scale simulation."
"Sintering of Sm-Co magnets was first reported on in 1969. Because of success in sintering, Sm-Co magnets are now enjoying added importance. Many processing parameters are critical in the preparation of high quality permanent magnets of Sm-Co. One of these is the sintering temperature. Varying the sintering temperature over a narrow range can produce great variations in properties. One particular Sm-Co alloy was chosen for this study. Sintering temperature was varied while all other processing parameters remained constant. Hysteresis measurements were then carried out in a 100 kOe air core magnet using a vibrating sample magnetometer. It was observed that high performance magnets could be obtained only within a narrow range of temperature, with precipitous drops in quality on both sides of the range. Within this narrow range, systematic and significant variations of some intrinsic properties were also observed."
  "A systematic study of the sintering conditions for PrCo5was carried out, using as the liquid-phase sintering aid an alloy that contained 69 weight percent (wt. %) Pr and 29 wt. % Co. The dependence of the permanent-magnet properties on the grinding time of PrCo5was evaluated. Different weight ratios of PrCo5and the Pr-Co additive were tried and various sintering temperatures and times were studied. It was found that milling time and weight ratio are factors of prime importance for successful sintering. Short milling time and relatively coarse particle size appear to be essential. Magnets sintered under optimum conditions have energy products of nearly 17 MG-Oe, remanence values up to 8500 G, and intrinsic coercive forces up to 9470 Oe. Details of the process and the results are reported."
"A novel method of achieving pulsewidth regulation through control of the distribution of flux variations in a dual-core transformer is described. Transfer of drive power or load power is accomplished by utilizing a principal core during a portion of each half-cycle of applied ac voltage. The flux excursion necessary to generate the required counter EMF during the remainder of each input half-cycle takes place in a second or \"control core\" by which means the duty cycle is varied. Applicability of the scheme to dc-to-dc converters is discussed. Although direct sensing of the output is employed, the negative feedback loop is closed by magnetic coupling to the transformer so that complete input-to-output isolation is obtained. Integrated circuitry provides the required variable time delay in the feedback network."
   "The practical feasibility of display and sensing systems using the magnetooptic properties of the three most widely discussed bubble-domain materials is discussed; the orthoferrites (100 μm bubbles), the garnets (10 μm bubbles), and the hexaferrites (1 μm bubbles). It is found that on a per bubble basis, the incident light intensity at the surface of the magnetic platelet necessary for both applications is remarkably close for all three materials, varying only between several microwatts and several tens of microwatts. Because of the large range of bubble diameters, however, the power per unit area varies from a quite tolerable 0.025 W/cm2in orthoferrites to a prohibitive 114 W/cm2for hexaferrite. Thus orthoferrite magnetooptic devices should be relatively straightforward, garnet devices will require careful heat sinking, and hexaferrite devices seem very doubtful."
"A technique is presented that uses numerical methods to obtain the fields for heads with eddy currents (finite permeability and conductivity) and for heads with complex permeability. Calculated results show that the effect of high permeability overrides the influence of eddy currents on fringe fields, even for small skin depths. Inside the pole tips, however, the fields are strongly dependent upon skin depth. Another result of interest is that the fields become elliptically polarized at low values of permeability and small skin depths. Heads with complex permeability exhibit similar results."
"A series of cobalt-substituted nearly stoichiometric nickel-zinc ferrites was investigated in order to develop a temperature independent square-loop ferrite which also had minimum magnetic noise. In particular the effect of nickel-zinc ratio, cobalt content, and sintering conditions on the temperature stability and on Barkhausen noise were studied. The optimal material showed no temperature dependence of coercive force between 0 and +75°C and had less noise than manganese-magnesium and lithium ferrites. A marked difference was observed between quenched and slow-cooled samples. Interpretation of the experimental results is based on the effects of cobalt on the crystalline and induced anisotropies in nickel-zinc ferrites."
  "The current status, i.e., the storage density and READ-WRITE rate of magnetooptic technology is reviewed. From the discussion of subsystems, it is clear that at present magnetooptical technology is mainly aimed at high-activity data base applications. The major problems for magnetooptic technology in mass storage are storage medium and transducer cost. Results on the recent developments of solid-state injection lasers are presented. This represents a breakthrough in transducer and beam control cost that is needed for the technology. The material requirements will also be discussed. Assuming future development in the above mentioned areas, we make a technology forecast on both short term and long term basis. For the short term it seems that the improvement made in both the transducer and the storage material will ameliorate the cost performance of the technology to the point that a class of magnetooptic files consistent with the mass storage requirements can be developed. For the long term, optimistic projections in light deflection and holographic techniques enable one to configure mass storage systems with throughput that can balance that of the memory."
"Transverse domain boundaries propagating in the longitudinal direction at speeds one to three orders of magnitude faster than normal domain walls are responsible for most of the lower speed reversals in magnetic thin films. Using a 10-ns exposure time Kerr magnetooptic camera, these boundaries have been photographed for a variety of applied fields in several films with thicknesses ranging from 500 to 3500 Å. High-magnification photographs of the boundary transition region reveal that the boundaries consist of small isolated areas of reversed and partially reversed magnetization in a nonreversed background. Propagation occurs by the nucleation of additional small areas of reverse magnetization within and ahead of the transition region. In a given film the width of the transition region increases as the applied field is increased. By approximating the divergence of the magnetization at the boundary as a line charge, a model has been derived which predicts the boundary widthWto beW = \\frac{8M_{s}t}{H_{n}}\\frac{1}{(1-H/H_{n})}where Msis the saturation magnetization andHis the applied field. The nucleation threshold Hnis the threshold at which nucleation is observed over all the film. The experimental data fit this predicted dependence quite well. The rapid increase in width of the transition region with applied field is correlated with a rapid nonlinear increase in the velocity of propagation."
  "The eddy currents in an infinitely long iron sheet caused by an alternating magnetic field are analyzed. At first, it is shown that any static hysteresis loop can be simulated with the help of a digital computer, as far as all the history ofH(t)is known. Using this computer program, the solution of the eddy current equation under the given initial and boundary conditions becomes possible considering the magnetic hysteresis in a general form. The proposed method can be available even under the voltage excitation. Some results of digital computation are shown : dynamic major loops under both sinusoidal current and sinusoidal voltage excitation, minor loops, andBandHdistributions in an iron sheet under superimposed alternating currents."

"Magnetic domains in thin crystal platelets of rare-earth-substituted iron garnets or rare-earth orthoferrites are readily visible when the platelets are viewed between crossed polarizers in a microscope, due to the magnetic Faraday effect. Several interesting optical-measurement techniques using this effect for investigating mobility, coercivity, wall energy, anisotropy, and imperfections are reviewed and compared."
 "The longitudinal and transverse phonon generation by ferromagnetic resonance in a thin film, which is subjected to both spin-pinned and spin-unpinned boundary conditions, is calculated. An arbitrary acoustic-impedance condition at the film surface which is bonded to a nonmagnetic rod is used. The spin-unpinned case gives more power transmitted into the rod than the spin-pinned case under otherwise optimized conditions. In addition the optimum acoustic impedance of the rod for maximum power transmission is much smaller than the impedance of the film."
"A high-speed optical stroboscopic system has been employed to examine the motion of magnetic domains in a current-drive propagating circuit used in conjunction with yttrium orthoferrite. Effects due to variations in the drive and bias fields and the frequency of propagation are observed in various parts of the circuit. The results are combined with the circuit and material parameters to yield a high-frequency propagation limit for the system and a qualitative understanding of the domain motion."
"A simple technique for measuring the velocity versus force curve of a circular magnetic domain has been devised. The technique consists of moving a domain under a straight current conductor which is adjacent to the surface of the wafer. A square-wave current is applied and the amplitude adjusted until the domain jiggles back and forth under the conductor a distance equal toR, whereRis the radius of the domain. The blurred domain is observed using the Faraday effect. The magnitude of the effective driving field for a conductor with a width equal toR, spaced0.1 habove the wafer, is0.158 I/hwhenR = h(his the wafer thickness). The velocity is equal to2 Rf."
 "We report on the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of EuO thin films having a [200] preferential growth, for6\\deg < T < 300\\degK under low or high magnetic fields according to the spectral range investigated. A tentative interpretation of the temperature dependence of the spectra is proposed. Zero field spectra have been obtained after previous magnetization of the sample below Tc; this provides a new method to determine Tcin zero field."
"The Faraday effect in YFeO3and DyFeO3was investigated in the wavelength region from 0.6 to 1.8 μ. A gas laser operating at 0.63, 1.15, and 3.39 μ was used. The Faraday rotation in yttrium and dysprosium orthoferrites at the wavelength 0.63 μ is equal to - 3000°/cm and - 4000°/cm, respectively. These values accord with figures calculated from the measurements when light is propagated along thecaxis. The sign of the rotation is opposite to that in YIG. Optical axes lie in theaplane. The angle between the optical axis of YFeO3and thecaxis equals 52° and 46° at the wavelengths 0.63 and 3.39 μ, respectively. The absorption coefficient of the samples used was 200 cm-1at\\lambda = 0.63 \\mu."
 "Procedures for the preparation of alloys suitable for the manufacture of permanent magnets based on CeCo5and on PrCo5are described. Single phase alloys of CeCo5and PrCo5are induction melted, rapidly cooled, and then homogenized. Procedures are also given for preparing low melting cerium-rich and praseodymium-rich cobalt alloys which are used as liquid phase sintering aids in the preparation of the magnets."
"Epitaxial thin films of Ni-Fe alloys from 44- to 87- percent Ni and Ni-Co alloys from 70- to 82-percent Ni have been deposited onto step-free MgO substrates at 400°C. The strain sensitivity of the anisotropy field\\DeltaH_{k}/\\epsilonhas been measured along the [100] and [110] direction in the"
 "Static and dynamic properties of bubble domains are given for a number of mixed rare earth and related iron garnets that have growth induced noncubic magnetic properties that are of interest and, in some cases, are useful for bubble-domain device applications. Rules for predicting domain alignments related to {211} facets, the various cuts for obtaining useful platelets, and compositional controls for obtaining temperature independent properties are also outlined."
   "A computer-aided design (CAD) system has been developed having an automatic computing capability for optimum driving current Ifc(central value of If) and an operating margin as a function of ambient temperature and a number of pairs for delta noise. The worst driving conditions are clarified for two cases : the case of cross-temperature operation (WRITE at one temperature and RETRIEVE or READ at another) and the case of unbalanced drive. The results are adopted as the main algorithm in this CAD system. Input data to this system aredV_{1}, dV_{0}, \\DeltaN(the delta noise) of 10-200 pieces of sampled core. Outputs of the system are various kinds of graphs, such as Ifc, and upper and lower limits for driving current as a function of ambient temperature. The two points of this paper are the establishment of the worst driving conditions considering the cross-temperature effect and completion of a CAD system."
"The independent grain model previously employed in analyzing the effect of stress on remanence ratios with stress parallel to the magnetic field has been extended to include the case of stress perpendicular to the field. In addition, the results have been averaged to obtain more realistic approximations to the stress sensitivities as functions of the magnetic anisotropy constant K1and magnetostriction constant λ100and λ111. From theory, it is concluded that forK_{1} < 0, the parallel stress sensitivity is eliminated when\\lambda_{100} = -0.41 \\lambda_{111}. For the perpendicular case,\\lambda_{100} = -1.15 \\lambda_{111}with\\lambda_{111}< 0and\\lambda_{100} = -0.38 \\lambda_{111}with\\lambda_{111} > 0. ForK_{1} > 0, both stress sensitivities may be removed when\\lambda_{111} = 0. The results of experiments with both single crystal and polycrystalline Y3MnxFe5-xO12compositions show qualitative agreement with theory, but also indicate that other mechanisms probably influence changes in remanence ratio."
"\"Hunting,\" or small random excursions of the rotor, in synchronous motors may cause objectionable time-displacement errors in video headwheel drives and other precision scanning systems. The idealized model of the hunting motor is seen to be a simple second-order linear system. Hysteresis motors behave very much like classical synchronous motors, except that the motor magnetic pole definition varies slightly with torque. During these excursions, there is some natural damping comprised of a linear eddy current effect and a nonlinear hysteresis effect. The nonlinear effect causes the oscillatoryQto vary inversely with angular motion. A qualitative theory is offered to explain this. New damping techniques have been developed using only electrical components, and include both active and passive circuits. All of them, however, operate without need of explicit motion detection. In an active damping circuit developed for a satellite video recorder, a reduction in time-displacement error of an order of magnitude has been achieved. No loss of motor torque capacity or efficiency is incurred."
  "Disturb properties of four-layered films of Permalloy and Co-Ni alternately electroplated onto 0.1-mm diameter wires are reported. NDRO behaviors with various kinds of disturbs are shown. It is found that word disturbs intervening between digit disturbs are very influential. The mechanism in this case is different from that of wall creeping previously reported. Static changes of magnetization or hysteresis by intervening word pulses play an important role in the former case, although in the latter case dynamic changes of magnetization do. Some strange disturb behaviors are also found. These composite films have a wide operating region for NDRO."
"The domain-wall mobility has been measured in (Gd1-xTbx)3Fe5O12and (Gd1-xDyx)3Fe5O12forxin the range 0 to 0.33. All the measurements were performed at 25°C on flux-grown crystals, and the mobility was found to vary from 2250 (cm/s)/Oe for Gd3Fe5O12to 160 (cm/s)/Oe for (Gd0.67Dy0.33)3Fe5O12and 78 (cm/s)/Oe for (Gd0.67Tb0.33)3Fe5O12. The damping of the wall motion was found to increase linearly withxto a good approximation. A method of determining the wall mobility in bulk samples from measurements of the RF susceptibility spectra is described. The results are discussed in terms of the slow relaxation model."
"A thyristor controlled ferroresonant voltage regulator circuit is described, whereby the output voltage is highly regulated and adjustable. This is accomplished by means of a simple one-piece magnetic structure and a thyristor control cricuit which, in combination, provides a regulator circuit having terminal characteristics identical to the conventional ferroresonant regulator, with the additional features of having voltage adjust capability and the means for improving regulation characteristics by feedback circuit techniques."

"An approach to efficient plated-wire memory cell design is described. Disturb mechanisms are not considered; instead, minimization of the drive requirement is the basic criterion. Various models of the magnetization distribution at the edges of a bit which is being driven are investigated, and it is shown that the hyperbolic tangent function is a good approximation to the real distribution. This result is used to determine the cell structure requiring minimum drive for a specified output flux and one which minimizes the drive current-cell area product for specified output. It is shown that current.cell area\\approx 14\\phi_{s}^{0.75}H_{k}^{0.25}S^{0.75}d^{0.75}where φsis the signal flux required, Hkthe anisotropy field of the material,dis the plated-wire diameter, andSthe plated-wire pitch."
"The effects of stress upon the magnetic properties of Mumetal have been studied in detail. The longitudinal Kerr effect has been used to study the domain patterns and the transverse Kerr effect used to obtain surfaceB-Hloops characteristic of the material. Bulk measurements were obtained by making standard bridge measurements of initial permeability. The effect of grinding has been studied using toroidal samples of thicknesses from 300 to 1620 μm. A possible method of estimating the depth of damage due to grinding by a) obtaining surfaceB-Hloops as layers of material have been successively chemically removed, and b) by \"skin effect\" testing, has been considered. The effect of simple tension on initial permeability has been examined for material with negative (-20 J/m3), zero and positive (+10 J/m3) values of anisotropy constant K1."
"Current efforts to exploit the spatial redundancy and built-in imaging of holographic optical techniques to provide high information densities (>106bit/cm2) without critical alignment and tight mechanical tolerances are reviewed. Read-write-erase in situ operation is possible but is presently impractical because of limitations in available recording media. As these are overcome, it should prove feasible to build holographic bulk memories with mechanically replaceable hologram plates featuring very fast (<2 μs) random access to large (>108bit) data blocks and very high throughput (>500 Mbit/s). Using volume holographic storage it may eventually be possible to realize random-access mass memories which require no mechanical motion and yet provide very high (>1011bit) capacity."
"A 3648-bit memory, based on bubble technology, has been designed and constructed. This moderately high-density design, 600 bit/mm2, serves as a test vehicle for proposed mass memories. The series-parallel organization utilizes 38 transfer gates that are simultaneously activated by reverse rotation of the drive field. Forty-eight words of 76 bits each can be stored and randomly accessed. The storage medium is Gd2.34,Tb0.66Fe5O12, and T-bar propagating circuits are used. The design and operation of the memory is described. The operating margins are given. Underlying design principles and criteria for propagating circuits have evolved and are presented."
"The observation of the suppression of flux switching induced by relatively long low-amplitude magnetic pulses is reported. This effect has been observed in Si-doped YIG in the irradiated state at low temperatures. Prior to the pulse-induced changes, the material is readily switched by pulses of amplitudeH_{p} = 28.5Oe and duration\\tau_{p} = 5 mus. After the application of conditioning pulses of amplitude, e.g.,H_{cond} = 2Oe and\\tau_{cond} > 10ms irreversible switching in the preceding large pulsesH_{p}, \\tau_{p}is suppressed. These observations are discussed in terms of the displacement of domain walls pinned by centers (Fe2+ions) having a wide range of pinning strength and relaxation times."
"A theoretical analysis of serviceable plated wire yield for magnetic film memories, taking into account the method of cutting into modules, the module sizes, and the probability of the occurrence of defective wire elements, is presented."
 "Due to the crystalline field, the rare-earth atoms in low symmetry may show a high magnetic anisotropy. In such materials, especially in Dy3Al2and TbNi1-xCux(0 < x < 0.4), because of the high anisotropy, the energy of narrow walls can be smaller than that of Bloch walls. Such narrow walls are frozen as long as the applied field is smaller than a critical field approximately equal to the coercive field. The coexistence of a large remanent magnetization and a large coercive field associated with this new type of domain wall suggests that such materials may be highly feasible for permanent magnets."
 "It is shown that in YIG the magnetization in low fields is due to the same mechanisms for the whole temperature range to the Curie point. At a given temperature the magnetization curves for different samples can be reduced to a single curve by taking into account the grain size. The interpretation is based on a model proposed earlier by Globus: the value of the reversible magnetization would be determined by the wall bulging, the value of the nonreversible magnetization by the wall displacement inside a spherical grain. For different temperatures a single reduced line is obtained by introducing the saturation magnetization and the effective anisotropy field, which is calculated from the susceptibility measured on a sample with single domain grains. So, it is possible to obtain a single magnetization curve which characterizes the composition."
"Single crystals of the spinel system NiFe2-xInxO4have been prepared with0 < x < 0.47and studied by ferrimagnetic resonance techniques in theXband and in the temperature range 4.2 to 323°K. Magnetic moment variation withXindicates that forx < 0.25, In3+enter theAsites but for higher values ofxenter theBsites. At 0°K, K1variation withxcan be explained in terms of single ion energy only if the cubic field splitting parameter aBFe3+in theBsite is supposed to increase with In3+. This has been attributed to the contraction of aBsite due to accommodating a large In3+in theAsite. The decrease inAsite Fe3+concentration is seen to increase both |λ 100| and |λ 111| at lower temperatures."
"A new, inherently more reliable, method is described for fabricating Permalloy integrated memories. The process uses electrodeposited flux logic Permalloy elements. This permits large area arrays with very favorable magnetic characteristics. Low switching coefficients (S_{w} < 0.5Oeμs) are realizable together with very square-loop switching properties. Memory planes of 256 words × 72 bit and a density of 3500 bit/in2are currently being fabricated."
"A study of Fe-Ni semihard magnet alloys to be used for fereed switches or latching relays is reported. As a result of this study, it has been found that the Fe-Ni alloys can be improved as follows. 1) By adding Al and Ti to Fe-Ni alloys, these alloys can maintain their high residual magnetization. 2) By applying uni-axializing treatment to them, the square hysteresis loop of these alloys can be notably improved. It has also been made clear that such improvement in magnetic characteristics is due to the magnetic anisotropy developed in the rolling direction by the uniaxializing treatment. Fe-Ni alloys are economical materials with excellent square hysteresis loop and workability. Therefore, they have been studied as materials for various types of switching matrices."
"Polycrystalline garnets with room-temperatureX-band linewidth values below 4 Oe can reproducibly be prepared by reducing magnetocrystalline anisotropy and porosity to about zero values. The lowest linewidth which has been measured so far is\\DeltaH = 1.7Oe. Reduction of anisotropy can be accomplished by substitution of octahedral Fe3+ions by nonrelaxing ions of large enough ionic radius (In3+, Zr4+, Sn4+). Theoretical density and phase purity is achieved by simultaneous substitution of Y3+ions by Ca2+ions in combination with a tetravalention (Ge4+, Si4+, Zr4+, Sn4+) for charge compensation. In the different compositional series studied, low linewidth values can be obtained for a magnetization range of 1950 to 250 G. As a consequence of the phase purity and the complete absence of porosity, the perfect polycrystalline samples become transparent in the infrared \"window\" region of the Fe garnets."
 "Films of Permalloy for which standing spin-wave (SSW) linewidths do not increase with wavenumber have been experimentally obtained. It is shown that the broadening of the linewidth with wavenumber in the case of oblique incidence evaporation is quantitatively explained by a calculation of ΔHntaking into account the gradient of film thickness determined by the evaporation law. It is concluded that the interactions between different regions of the film do not appreciably influence the SSW linewidth, and that the effect of the thickness dropoff which appears at the edge of the films is negligible. In addition, it is shown that films of relatively large dimensions with a constant and small linewidth can be obtained by a careful arrangement of the evaporation system."
 "The use of galvanomagnetic readout techniques for producing output signals from magnetic thin film devices based on domain tip (DOT) propagation has been investigated. Whereas methods of inductively sensing the signal from a propagating DOT are limited to the order of 100 μV per output channel per turn of pickup loop, magnetoresistance can be used to produce output signals of several millivolts from a single output channel. In addition to permitting smaller readout elements to be made, magnetoresistance has the further advantage of providing a continuous rather than transient output signal. Two and four electrode configurations, for both the longitudinal magnetoresistance and the planar Hall effect, have been evaluated. The use of isolation slits etched into the magnetic layer to eliminate leakage currents has been investigated as well. The results indicate that small area readout elements with output signals in the range of several millivolts are practical."
  "Functional speed, measurements have been made on field-access T-bar and Y-bar bubble devices utilizing flux-grown crystal platelets of Gd2.34Tb0.66Fe5O12, Eu2Er1Ga0.65Fe4.35O12, Sm0.55Tb0.45FeO3, and epitaxially grown films of Eu1Er2Ga0.7Fe4.3O12. Propagation rates of 250 kbit/s with bias margins of ±7 percent have been achieved with epitaxial garnet films. A propagating device utilizing an epitaxial garnet film has demonstrated a storage capability of 1.6 Mbit/in2.The device, Which includes a propagation turn, has been worse case tested. This resulted in a bias margin of ±7 percent with a 25-Oe 100-kHz rotating in-plane field."
"An off-resonance technique, which permits the relaxation rate to be determined as a function of bias field, has been applied to Ni-Fe thin films for the first time. The data provide direct evidence for a strong two-magnon scattering contribution to the losses. The effective linewidth for a 1300-Å film at 9 GHz peaks near the parallel resonance position with\\Delta(\\omega/\\gamma)_{eff}\\approx 200Oe. It decreases above and below the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR).\\Delta(\\omega/\\gamma)_{eff}is reduced to 60 Oe at a bias 100 Oe below resonance. This sharp falloff indicates that the scattering is due to relatively large inhomogeneities, 3000Å or larger in size. The falloff above resonance is due to a decrease in both the density of states and coupling for the degenerate spin waves. The effective line shift due to spin-wave scattering is also strongly field dependent. It changes by more than 30 Oe in the vicinity of resonance. The data show that line-shift effects should completely obscure ripple field shifts (0.1-1 Oe) which can, in concept, be measured by FMR techniques."
"A high-speed easy-rewrite read-only memory has been developed utilizing 0.1-mm plated wires with multilayered NDRO thin film 4800 Å thick. Plated wires are put into grooves molded in a plastic sheet by forming wires which are slightly larger than the plated wires. The digit sheet is sandwiched between word lines formed by two turns of a pair of copper wires. Keepers are not used because of high-speed operation. Both word and digit lines are spaced at 1.0 mm center-to-center. An average output voltage of 12 mV was obtained for a word current of 400 mA with a rise time of 15 ns. IC has been used for most of the peripheral circuits. Word lines are selected by transistor matrix. An access time of 60 ns for a memory capacity of 1024 words by 144 bits was obtained."
"The authors have calculated the propagation constant in a stratified metallic medium taking the tensorial nature of the permeability into account. The dc magnetizing field is applied normal to the film plane and propagation is calculated either parallel to the film or in an oblique direction. It is shown that the projection of the propagation constant is independent of the propagation angle α as long as it is not close to the film normal. The effective permeability is finally similar to that previously obtained with a scalar permeability and the possibility of using such stratified magnetic materials, whose microwave characteristics are very interesting, is then confirmed."
 "The domain structures in thin single crystal foils of electropolished cobalt with thecaxis normal to the plane have been observed by Lorentz electron microscopy. After the application of fields in the range of 5-25 kOe along thecaxis, hexagonal arrays of cylindrical bubble domains were observed together with the more familiar plate-domain structure. The bubble structure was stable in the remanent state. Details of the magnetization configuration of the bubble together with measured dimensions are presented. The results are discussed in the light of calculation which shows that the energy of a hexagonal array of bubbles is a little higher than that of the plate domain structure. The bubble diameter is also calculated as a function of thickness."
"The theory of generation of reverse domains in poly-crystal magnetic material with an allowance for the effect of magnetic material with an allowance for the effect of magnetic permeability caused by anisotropy is presented. Specific domains are discussed that generate at the boundaries of grains and nonmagnetic inclusions. The energetic state of domains is analyzed, and the expression for the critical sizes of grains and inclusions is given where the reverse magnetization domains start to appear. From this expression it follows that atK \\gg M_{S}^{2}the critical radii are proportional to the ratio\\sigma_{w}/M_{s}^{2}whereKis the overall constant of anisotropy, Msis the saturation magnetization and σwis the domain-wall energy density. In this case the expression for the critical radii coincides with the one obtained earlier by Néel and Goodenough. AtM_{s^{2}}\\simg Kthe expression for critical radii is proportional to\\sigma_{w}/Kand is practically independent of Ms. The physical sense of the result obtained is discussed. The expression obtained is used to explain the effect of cobalt additions on the static properties of nickel-zinc ferrites."
 "The tuyau de poële, or stove pipe, is a new magnetic element giving a high output flux for a low driving current. The use of this element in a decoding switch is described. A new fabrication process was developed which uses electrodeposited gold conductors and Permalloy elements. This allows low-cost large arrays of such magnetic elements. Individual elements show good squareness (94 percent) and a high flux for a low switching current. A decoding switch with 32 elements was built. Use of this technology may open new areas for integrated micromagnetics."
"The variation of coercivity as a function of the temperature of annealing or sintering is reported for compacts of a single-phase PrCo5powder and also for a mixture of PrCo5with an additive richer in Pr. For single-phase PrCo5, the intrinsic coercive force decreases steadily with increasing heat-treating temperature and shows a minor peak near 1000°C. For magnets made with the additive, the curve ofMHcversusThas two peaks, one at approximately 1050°C and another at 1120°C. This behavior can be correlated with thermal events in the Pr-Co phase diagram. It is interpreted in terms of a model which assumes that pinning sites for the domain walls exist and are concentrated in shells forming on the surface of PrCo5grains during the sintering. These shell are thought to consist of Pr-Co compounds having lower melting points than PrCo5and to be epitaxial layers on or between the PrCo5grains into which the walls can travel from the latter."
 "From available single-crystal data on YIG:Ga and YIG :Ca-V-In, a comparison has been made of anisotropy line broadening in each series for compositions with equivalent4\\piM_{s}and Tc. The results indicate the latter materials have smaller anisotropies and should therefore have inherently lower magnetic loss when comparing ceramics with near perfect microstructures, i.e., where porosity line broadening is negligible."
   "Iron and copper are practically immiscible at all solid-state temperatures, but fine ferromagnetic iron phases are spaced by a nonmagnetic copper matrix. Severe cold drawing is carried out to obtain the fine elongated iron particles in a copper matrix. Magnetic properties are investigated at different stages of cold drawing and of various alloy compositions. The effect of heat treatment after cold drawing is also investigated and the relationship between the shape of the iron particles and the magnetic properties is taken into consideration. Iron-copper alloys severely cold drawn have good magnetic properties not only as semihard magnetic materials but also as hard magnetic materials."
 "Trends in storage from 1952 to 1972 are presented. They include an increasing diversity of storage types, an increase in on-line storage capacity that exceeds the three-orders-of-magnitude increase in computer power, and an increased management of the storage complex by the system. The impact on past and present system design of the access gap between main memory and electro-mechanical storage is discussed. The growing importance of the gap between on-line and off-line storage is also noted. These two gaps represent significant opportunities for innovation in hardware and systems."
 "To permit further growth in the application of information systems, the lower level activities must be automated so that they cease to be a burden on the user. A synthesis of known hardware devices and software algorithms for dynamic storage allocation is advocated which can achieve acceptable efficiency at run time by using the explicitly defined data structure as a basis for store management and the prediction of store usage. The resultant automated storage complex also provides security against the propagation of consequential software failures. Consideration of the function of the individual storage devices which would be components of such a storage complex leads to some conclusions which may be useful for guiding the development of advanced storage devices."

"An analysis is made of the magnetic stress anisotropy field Hks, arising from internal and external stress sources in plated-wire memory elements. The analysis takes into consideration circumferential composition variation and cylindrical geometry of the Permalloy film. Expressions are derived relating Hksto uniaxial film stress, average composition, and amplitude of composition variation. A result of particular importance is that even for average zeromagnetostrictive composition (ZMC) films, Hksmay still make an appreciable contribution to the total anisotropy field if the composition is not uniform. Calculated Hkscharacteristics are shown to correlate with anisotropy field changes observed in annealing experiments. Examples are given to show the importance of composition uniformity in determining the stability of the anisotropy field. The utility of the analysis is extended by the inclusion of data expressing the inverse relation between anisotropy field and easy-axis dispersion in the film."
"An extension of an earlier model of the WRITE process in saturation recording that accounts for internal fields due to magnetization divergence in the recording medium is presented. It is shown that the initial condition of the medium determines the internal field distribution during WRITE and may lead to appreciable peak shift and WRITE over modulation. The special case of two successive reversals of magnetization for a dc biased recording medium is considered in detail. System design criteria for optimization of the recording medium parameters, the head pole gap, and the WRITE time constant are presented for a system where the remaining parameters are constrained. Calculation for the initial and quiescent magnetization and internal field and the expected signal trace, in addition to experimental data, are presented for an out-of-contact drum system employing a NiZn ferrite WRITE-READ head and a CoNiP plating."
"Proposed memory hierarchy technologies and configurations are usually evaluated by repeated running of \"typical\" jobs through simulated hierarchies while various parameters are adjusted. Simulation is too slow to be a tool for selecting among the choices in 1) technologies to be included, 2) implementation of each technology, and 3) management of data flow in the hierarchy. Four current hardware-managed hierarchies are described in a manner which parameterizes their design. The evaluation process is described in terms of address traces, hit ratios, and system cost performance. Stack processing is then described as a replacement for simulation that obtains hit-ratio data 1000 times faster than before. Finally, an example is given to illustrate how to select between two competing technologies, how to design the best hierarchy, and how to determine the information flow which optimizes the total cost performance of the system."
"A high-density coupled-hard-axis (CHA) destructive readout (DRO) magnetic-film device which yields storage density ≥ 6400 cells per square inch and drive currents compatible with ICs is described. A thin word line design is unique in that its own resistance is used as its termination. This thin word line design permits word line grouping on the substrate level resulting in larger spaced fan-out connections. Its relatively easy manufacturing process as batch fabricated arrays, compared with other comparable high-density memory devices, makes it attractive economically. Extensive experimental data has been obtained as to the disturb margins, signal levels, and keeper effect. In the evaluation of the device performance, the worst case disturb conditions are always applied. At operating conditions, signal levels are in the 2-mV range, disturb margins are ± 35 percent for the unipolar case, and ≥ 50 percent for the bipolar case. Domain-pattern studies were also made to gain further understanding of the device performance and stability relative to its magnetic structure."
"Results of grain-size measurements in Permalloy platings suggest that recrystallization is possible at temperatures as low as 200°C, but that it is an extremely heterogeneous process. No worthwhile correlation was found to exist between observed grain size and magnetic dispersion in samples aged in the temperature range 180 and 230°C, and it is suggested that the magnetic aging which occurs under these conditions may be due to some other diffusion-controlled process than recrystallization; a process such as chemical homogenization is tentatively preferred."
"In the next year several fourth generation machines with performance in the 100 million instructions per second range will become available. The Illiac IV is one of these machines. With the advent of these machines it will become practical to include an extra dimension, or to greatly increase the resolution of many mesh calculations. Problems which are currently constrained to two spatial dimensions can be expanded to three dimensions, and problems which are currently limited to one spatial dimension can be expanded to include two. This expansion in dimensionality and refinement in resolution implies an increase of approximately two orders of magnitude in the size of the problem's data base. The Unicon 690 mass-memory system will have two distinct uses in the Illiac IV system. The primary use of the Unicon 690 will be to act as a replacement for the conventional restart-output tapes which are generated in the course of large mesh calculations. The Unicon 690 will also act as a storage resource for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) network. The ARPA net is a collection of some twenty computers, interconnected by a 50 000 bit/s network of telephone lines and interface message processors. To facilitate the use as a resource on the ARPA net, a conventional computer will be interfaced to the 690 to act as a file manager. Performance parameters of the Unicon 690 are certainly not optimal for this requirement. As is generally the case, higher transfer and lower access time are desirable."
"Results of investigations using X-ray diffraction and electron-beam microprobe techniques have shown that copper and Permalloy platings interdiffuse at low temperatures (in the range 180-230°C) when plated-wire memory elements are annealed for times as short as 50 h. Measurable interdiffusion between Permalloy platings and gold substrates does not occur in similar conditions. Both magnetic and compositional changes during aging are found to occur by a thermally activated process with activation energies around 38 kcal/mol. It is shown, however, that copper-diffusion and magnetic-dispersion changes during aging are merely concurrent processes, neither being the other's cause."
"The Federal Government is the largest buyer of magnetic tape in the world. Current procurement is approximately one million reels annually. Of these tapes, slightly ever 1 percent are destined to contain data of permanent value. The problems the National Archives and Records Service (NARS) is encountering in preserving machine-readable records for long periods of time, particularly periods in excess of either the shelf life or technological life of the medium, are described. The economics of magnetic tape storage and NARS long-range storage requirements are discussed. Performance parameters for both a device and medium for the 1975-1980 time frame are given. These are basically 1) a medium lifetime of 50 years, equivalent to archival microfilm; 2) transfer rates equivalent to magnetic tape drives for the next 20 years; and 3) an annual capacity to transcribe 1012bit/year. Removable media are acceptable, as access time and bulk are not critical parameters."
"Desirable characteristics for future massive storage systems in the 1012- to 1015-bit range are projected for systems operating in a shared storage environment. Characteristics for capacity, cost, access, and reliability, as deemed important to the user of such systems are listed. Emphasis is placed on the operation of large capacity storages as central data banks serving a number of remotely located dissimilar computer systems."
"The development of United Air Lines operational computer system is described. This is a medium-volume general-purpose on-line system with off-line capability, the need for such a system arose from the decentralized nature of airline operations coupled with the increasing need to automate many areas of company operations in addition to the traditional reservations and accounting functions. The computer utility is designed to handle all of the airline's message switching, flight planning and monitoring, and aircraft parts inventory control. Also under evaluation and implementation are applications involving airport terminals and air freight control."
"The technology of software of data base management systems is described, and the influence that hardware has had on such systems in the past is discussed. In addition, an attempt is made to highlight some hardware advances that are awaited eagerly by software designers."
"The experience and plans of three scientific computing installations with bulk storage are reviewed with respect to capacity requirements, reliability enhancement, and the avoidance of recording delays. The bulk storage requirements of experimental data bases, array storage for large-scale scientific calculations, and large output files are reviewed. Results are presented of a survey of tape libraries in scientific computing installations. From user experience, applications, and the survey results, requirements for two classes of bulk storage devices emerge: dynamic bulk storage devices and archival bulk storage devices. Dynamic bulk storage devices are accessed repeatedly during the calculation, hence the access and bandwidth requirements must be comparable to current large-capacity disks, and capacity should be on the order of 1011bit. Archival bulk storage devices are used largely at the beginning or at the end of a calculation, so access and bandwidth requirements are somewhat relaxed with respect to dynamic bulk storage, but capacity requirements should be at least 1012bit."
"The magnetization and core loss of Supermendur were measured up to 900°C under conditions of slow temperature cycling in vacuum. As a consequence of this heating the coercivity at 25°C increased from 21 A/m to about 110 A/m. This increase is less than previously reported. A prominent anomalous Barkhausen effect, pinched-in hysteresis loops, and a magnetic viscosity field in excess of 20 A/m were observed in the range 600 to 700°C. At 850°C Super-mendur had a coercivity of 23 A/m, a saturation induction exceeding 1.5 T, a core loss of 26 W/kg at 400 Hz, andB_{\\max}of 1.5 T. Super-mendur may be useful for high temperature soft magnetic material applications where some history dependence of properties and instability of minor loops at lower temperatures is acceptable."
"Recently, magnetic devices utilizing a partial switching have been used in many fields. From a point of core design, a flux distribution must be known. It is possible to calculate them under some assumptions, but it is difficult to measure them experimentally. This paper describes a technique of determining a flux distribution in toroidal and multiaperture ferrite cores. The patterns of flux distribution are expressed by a flux of local zone. The flux level is determined by measuring a second-harmonic voltages induced in a pick up coil under an application of a small ac magnetic field (10 kHz) orthogonal to the plane of core. Small holes for sensing are drilled through the core, and the pick up coil encloses cross-sectional areas between each of the holes. It was found that a flux reversal boundary in a toroidal core travels from inner edge to outer edge when it is switched partially by a dc field, but a pulse field switching produces a complex flux distribution, and that in both cases, the flux reversal boundary is not sharp. By a similar method, the flux distribution in the transfluxor is shown for the \"unblocked\" and \"blocked\" state before and after the interrogation. The transfluxor in the unblocked state after the interrogration showed a \"kidney shaped\" pattern. Readout characteristics obtained from the measured flux distributions agree with those obtained by ordinary induced voltage methods. The accuracy of the readout flux is about 8.7 percent."
"A 9-month comparison between a single component flux gate and a proton magnetometer has been made. The fluxgate sensor was oriented parallel to the total field so that the output was directly comparable to a proton mangnetometer reading. During the period the total drift of the flux-gate magnetometer baseline was +35γ."
"A visual nondestructive method for determining the uniaxial anisotropy directions in magnetic thin films without active electronic instruments is discussed. Only a rod magnet and a magnetic tape viewer are required."
"A model involving head motion is given for self-consistently computing magnetic recording medium magnetization patterns. The reduction in demagnetizing field due to the presence of the high-permeability head structure is included, as is record head removal, read head replacement, and computation of the readback voltage. The model is capable of handling an arbitrary record current waveform. Optimum record-current amplitude for nonreturn to zero (NRZ) digital recording is first determined, and then single-, double-, and quadruple-transition computations are performed using two different values of hysteresis loop squarenessM_{r}/M_{s}and both linear and exponential current reversals. Results are primarily for the Karlquist fringe field, but the recording properties of a head exhibiting regions in which the fringe field reverses sign are also briefly investigated."
"The specific Faraday rotation of the homogeneous low-temperature phase (LTP) and quenched high-temperature phase (HTP) MnBi films used for the writing experiments was measured to be9.5\\times10^{5}degrees per centimeter and4.3\\times10^{5}degrees per centimeter, respectively, at 25°C and a light wavelength of 632.8 nm. The coercive field of the films decreased exponentially with increasing film thickness for both phases. Thermomagnetic writing experiments showed that the written spots (1 to 10 μm in diameter) were not satisfactorily stable for films thicker than 50 nm. If thicker films are to be used for magnetooptic memory applications, they should possess larger wall-motion fields than the films investigated, in order to achieve stable spots. The erasure field of the spots was found to depend on the strength of the applied writing field and on the duration and the power of the heating laser pulse. A writing-erasing hysteresis was recorded by means of the Faraday effect. A thermal saturation field is introduced and measured in dependence on film thickness for LTP films. With the help of this field and wall-pinning effects, thermomagnetic writing in MnBi films is discussed."
"Analysis and the results of calculations connected with the closing process and bounces of dry reeds are presented. Dynamic properties of dry-reed relay are described by means of several dimensionless parameters. The calculation results of dynamic properties of dry-reed relays are presented in appropriate characteristics. The case of quasi-optimal control is also discussed."
"Earlier studies of ferroresonance note the existence of unsymmetrical modes of operation of series circuits with square-loop reactors. Here the observation of stable second harmonics in a series ferroresonant circuit with a reactor having very nonsquare-loop core material is noted; these harmonics produce unsymmetrical circuit waveforms. Circuit behavior is described, and a qualitative explanation is offered. An approximate solution of the nonlinear circuit equations using the method of reversion of series shows good correlation with the experimental waveforms. From the analysis, the necessary condition for this mode of circuit operation is shown to be the presence of a constant component of flux in the circuit. Potential application of the circuit as a logic element is suggested."
"Second-harmonic generation experiments show that large optical nonlinearities are associated with isocyclic and heterocyclic organic groups. The nonlinearities in one compound of the pyrimidine family, 5-Nitrouracil, are estimated to be as large as in barium-sodium niobate."
"CW-excited GaAs lasers can emit self-induced pulses. To study these pulses we have used an intensity correlator involving phase-matched second-harmonic generation in LiIO3. Besides measuring the pulsewidth and the repetition rate we investigated the amplitude fluctuations within a pulse and the correlation between fluctuations of consecutive pulses."
 "A Fabry-Perot resonator filled with a dielectric slab is investigated using the Vainshtein method. Simple and explicit formulas are obtained for the diffraction loss, phase shift, and field distributions for both strip and circular mirrors. It is found that the presence of the dielectric reduces the diffraction loss, and causes mode confinement to certain degrees."
"The results of experimental studies of the various saturation effects and of discharge processes that occur in He-Cd lasers are presented and interpreted. It was found that the laser output can be adequately described by means of the rate equations. Based on these rate equations and the experimental results, the output and configuration of the He-Cd laser may be optimized. An estimate of the transfer cross section between the helium metastable and the cadmium atom is also presented."
"Optical demultiplexers have been developed for a time-division-multiplexed (TDM) high-capacity optical pulse code modulation (PCM) terminal. The demultiplexing is accomplished by assigning two orthogonal linearly polarized states of light to adjacent pulses using an electrooptic modulator and then spatially separating them with a polarization selective prism. The process is repeated until all the channels are separated. In order to separate pulses 1.7 \\times 10^{-10}s apart, corresponding to pulse chains of a 24-channel 250 megabits per second per channel time-division-multiplexed PCM system, a voltage sufficient to vary the relative phase retardation by \\pm2\\pi/\\sqrt{3}rad at 1 GHz is necessary. The ability of the demultiplexer to separate the pulses depends on the residual strain in the crystal as well as on the temperature gradients introduced by the high-frequency voltage applied to the small volume of modulator crystal. The importance of these effects in determining the crosstalk ratio between adjacent channels is analyzed. A comparison of several ferroelectric crystals, which show a linear, transverse electrooptic effect, is made for potential demultiplexer applications. It is concluded that LiTaO3and Ba2NaNb5O15 are about equivalent as crystals for demultiplexers, provided that crystals of the same size and optical quality are available. Measurements to evaluate the crosstalk ratio of demultiplexers using LiTaO3are described. A modulator with 1.5 W of applied power was sufficient to provide a crosstalk ratio of 19 at λ = 0.63 μ whereas two modulators, each with 1 W of applied power, were needed at λ = 1.06 μ to obtain the same crosstalk ratio. Together with the high-speed optical gates and schemes of multiplexing demonstrated in the past, the present measurements demonstrate the capability of existing electrooptic modulators to function in a high-bit-rate (6000 megabits/s) TDM optical PCM communication system."
"CW laser oscillation from singly ionized mercury at 6150 and 7945 Å has been observed in a transverse-discharge slotted hollow-cathode laser. Population inversion is attributed to charge transfer and Penning-type ionization reactions."
"By means of fluorescence, decay measurements in a He-Zn pulsed afterglow, the Zn II laser transitions at 5894 and 7479 Å have been assigned to Penning collisions with He(23S1) metastable atoms.

"High-gain directional stimulated emission has been observed for a number of dyes in gelatin with pumping by a nitrogen laser or a liquid dye laser. For some dyes the gel is made with water and gelatin; for others a detergent must be added or glycerin used instead of water."
"Observation of self-locking is reported in a CO2multipass laser. Phase-locked pulsing occurred at or in multiples of the cavity round-trip transit time. The observed pulse half-widths ranged from 60 to 70 ns."
"The spatial and temporal refractive-index changes produced by a pulsed discharge in a CO2-N2mixture, under conditions which produce gains in excess of 10 dB/m, have been measured experimentally using an interferometric technique. The spatial refractive-index variation can lead to a significant increase in the divergence of a beam propagating through a laser amplifier a few meters in length. From the measured refractive-index changes, the gas temperature profile after the cessation of the current pulse has been calculated. The peak temperature obtained is between 600 and 700 K. The addition of helium to the CO2-N2mixture did not significantly affect the peak temperature but did result in a decrease in the thermal relaxation time."
"A detailed experimental study of laser signature as a function of laser mirror distance variations is reported. This was done for small sealed low-power CO2lasers (≈ 1 watt) of the type useful in laser communication. It is shown that most laser-output profiles change drastically from half-wavelength to half-wavelength except the strong P(20) line, which seems to remain relatively constant. Frequency width is given for many of the laser output profiles appearing in the various signatures observed. Line competition is also discussed."
"A new technique for the display of picosecond light pulses is presented. Ultrashort (6 ps) green light pulses passing through a light-scattering medium are photographed from the side by a camera positioned behind a shutter of 10-ps framing time. The shutter is an ultrafast Kerr cell driven by infrared pulses 8 ps in duration. Color photographs show a bright spot on a dark background, revealing the unambiguous presence of well-isolated picosecond light pulses. The shape of the spot is the result of a convolution involving the three-dimensional shape of the green pulse and the time transmission function of the shutter, this function being dictated by the shape of the infrared pulse. The experiment indicates that a new technique for visualizing light pulses consists in simply observing their flight through a scattering medium from behind an ultrafast shutter having a framing time equal to the time resolution desired. The new technique has many advantages over the two-photon fluorescence display technique, such as higher sensitivity, wider spectral range, and easier interpretation. The ultrafast camera also can be used for the photographic measurement of ultrashort relaxation times in dielectrics and in fluorescent dyes."
"Pulsed laser action at 2.119 μ has been observed from Ho3+in a crystal of YAlO3sensitized with Er3+and Tm3+. A linearly polarized output of 1.2 J was obtained at 77°K. Measurements of the anisotropy of the stimulated-emission cross sections are reported."
"In this paper we discuss the possibilities and realization in high-power systems of a narrow-band reflector with adjustable high reflectivity and with continuous tuning over a large frequency region. We describe a design for both low- and high-gain systems. For the experimental realization of a low-gain system we used a CO2laser and studied a continuous range of 65 transitions of the00\\deg1-02\\deg0and 13 transitions of the 0111-1110 vibrational band. With a cavity containing a dc discharge 130 cm long, for each band we found a continuous range of single oscillating transitions with output powers up to 15 W. Finally, we propose an experimental solution for continuous tuning of a high-gain system as, for instance, the central part of the00\\deg1-10\\deg0vibrational band of CO2."

"The possibility of transverse mode locking using cylindrically symmetric laser modes is considered. For a specified set of mode amplitudes and phases it is found that the beam intensity profile in the transverse plane is the same shape as the fundamental mode, but has a spot size that is time varying with the transverse-mode spacing frequency. The beam power is the sum of the powers of the individual modes."

"This correspondence reports on the successful operation of a TEA CO2laser at rates up to 1000 pps with an average output power up to 65 W over long periods of time. An essential feature of the present system is a rapid gas circulation transverse to the laser axis combined with a large volume of ambient gas. It is found that decomposition of the gas is one of the major problems at high repetition rates."
"The molecular Stark effect and its application to the modulation of infrared laser radiation have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Using a density matrix approach, a quantum mechanical description of the effect of a time-varying electric field on the absorption coefficient and refractive index of a molecular gas near an absorption line has been formulated. For modulation applications a quantity known as the \"modulation depth\" is of prime importance. Theoretical expressions for the frequency dependence of the modulation depth show that the response to the frequency of a time-varying Stark field is separated into a nondispersive and a dispersive region, depending on whether the modulating frequency is less than or greater than the homogeneous absorption linewidth. Experimental results showing nondispersive modulation at frequencies to 30 MHz are presented. In addition it is shown that the response of modulation depth to Stark field amplitude is separated into linear and nonlinear regions, the field at which nonlinearities begin being determined by the absorption spectrum of the molecule being used."
"We report the measurement of the amplification cross section σ21of the Nd3+ion in the POCl3-SnCl4-(H2O) system by three different methods. The first is based on the simultaneous measurement of the variation of fluorescence andQ-spoiled laser emission. The second is purely spectroscopic. The third is based on the measurement of k12at several temperatures. The two last methods give similar results. The most probable value is\\sigma_{21} = 8.5 \\times 10^{-20}cm2. An explanation for the lowest value\\sim 6 \\times 10^{-20}cm2found with the first method is given."
"A nanosecond-long train of picosecond laser pulses theoretically can produce self-focusing by electrostriction, even though the trapping threshold for a single picosecond pulse is very high. The relative roles of electrostriction and various types of Kerr effect in picosecond pulse train self-focusing should be assessed."
"Experimental measurements of laser power output and chemical efficiency are reported for a continuous HF chemical laser. In this device, arc-heated N2is mixed in a plenum with SF6to provide F atoms. The mixture is expanded to form a supersonic jet into which H2is diffused. Population inversion and lasing are due to H2+ F → HF(υ) + H,\\upsilon \\leq 3, \\DeltaH = -31.7 kcal. Power levels up to 1 kW have been obtained. The efficiency of conversion of chemical energy to laser power is 16 percent at low SF6flow rates and approximately 10 percent at peak power. For a fixed arc power, addition of O2into the plenum raises peak power by about 25 percent under present operating conditions and reduces sulphur deposition on mirror surfaces. The presence of HF and DF in the plenums of DF and HF lasers, respectively, did not appear to degrade laser performance. (HF and DF levels up to 10 percent of the local F concentration were studied.) However, the presence of HF and DF in the plenums of HF and DF lasers, respectively, did degrade laser output. For given flow conditions, peak net laser power was obtained when the optical cavity axis was about 2 cm downstream of the H2injection station. The net output power was reduced to zero when the cavity axis location was increased to 5 cm."
"Electrical plasma parameters of the CO2laser were investigated by probe and high-frequency techniques. The electron energy distribution function was measured by the second derivative method. The relatively high-pressure effect on the electron probe current was taken into account when analyzing the experimental curves. The influence of the addition of N2, He, Xe and the influence of CO2dissociation on the plasma discharge properties were studied. Calculations of the pumping rates to vibrational levels taking part in creating inversion show that the influence on output power of a CO2laser usually observed with the addition of N2and He cannot be explained by a changing of the electron component of the plasma. The increase of output power and efficiency with addition of Xe to the CO2laser is connected with an essential changing of plasma parameters of the electron component."
"The effects of adding Xe, H2, and O2to the CO-He laser discharge are studied mass spectroscopically. Xe greatly reduces CO dissociation. H2does not react chemically but alters discharge kinetics. O2has little effect on the CO-Xe-He discharge but reduces CO dissociation in CO-He."

"A general three-wave nonlinear (NL) optical interaction can be phase matched using the dispersion of optical waveguide modes. The phase-match condition can be fine tuned by varying the direction of propagation in a two-dimensional waveguide and using a birefringent NL material with an orientation that preserves TE and TM mode propagation. Two general cases are found where this technique is possible. The effects of crystal symmetry and orientation on the size of the NL interaction are calculated for all birefringent crystal classes and cubic crystal classes."

"This paper will begin with a survey of the general problem of correlation spectroscopy. It will present a novel approach to the derivation of theN-time generating functions and will use these generating functions to compute the expected signals in four kinds of photon-correlation devices and the noise associated with these signals. The four devices treated are 1) the full digital correlator, 2) the gated digital correlator, 3) the multichannel analyzer, 4) the pulse-separation analyzer. We compare the information-gathering abilities of the four systems by showing how the quantity(1/T) (\\Gamma/\\sigma_{\\Gamma})^{2}varies as a function of the number of channels used, the number of observed correlation times, the average count rate, and the gating levels. Here\\Gammais the half-width of a Lorentz line,\\sigma_{\\Gamma}is the uncertainty in\\Gammaas computed from a least-squares fit to the data, andTis the length of the experiment."
"Mode-control experiments at a 30-kW CW power level with an unstable resonator at a high Fresnel number were performed on a gas dynamic laser. Near- and far-field intensity distributions were obtained that are consistent with theoretical values for an approximately twice diffraction-limited beam. Under these conditions, the output power was more than half of the maximum multi-mode power."
"An expression for the threshold output power density for spontaneous mode locking inQ-switched lasers is derived. The resulting expression is readily evaluated in terms of laser emission cross section and linewidth and cavity geometry. The expression is evaluated for several experiments which previously reported spontaneous mode locking."
"Enhanced He-Ne gas laser stability has been achieved by constructing the mirror and gas discharge tube as an integral unit. The primary components are made from Corning ULE and 99JJW ultralow thermal expansion materials; ultrahigh-vacuum-type materials are used throughout. The ambient pressure sensitivity of these 6328-Å laser structures is 2.5 MHz/torr. Preliminary beat frequency measurements between two lasers, under pressure and temperature-controlled conditions, have yielded a beat frequency spectral width of the order of 2 kHz over an interval of 1 s. This result was achieved without the use of any elaborate sound or vibration isolation. Improved isolation reduced the spectral width to 100 Hz for a measurement duration of 0.02 s. The single-structure mirror-discharge tube has provided relative output power stabilities of better than 3 parts in 1000 over a period of 12 h. The frequency-modulation sensitivity is 1.2 kHz/μA of discharge current, from dc to 100 kHz."
"The afterglow pulse-gain technique was used to measure the relaxation of the 00°1 upper laser level in N2O from 300 to 700°K. The rate constantk_{N_{2}O}(torr-1s-1) varies with temperature as\\log10k_{N_{2}O} = 4.53 - 10.9T^{-1/3}. Measurements of the relaxation time at 300°K agree with the fluorescence technique results of Yardley [1]. Gain studies were also made with gas mixtures in a nonflowing system. Single-pulsed N2O + CO + He mixtures at 300°K showed considerable peak gain. However, subsequent pulses of these mixtures show that the gain is reduced because of the chemical reaction forming CO2. Measurements of this transformation from one molecular laser mixture to another are discussed."
"The refractive indices of the ternaryA^{I}B^{III}C_{2}^{VI}semiconductors AgGaS2, CuGaS2, and CuInS2have been measured over the entire range of transparency of these crystals. The optical nonlinear coefficients for second-harmonic generation have also been determined. Three-frequency collinear phase matching is analyzed in detail for AgGaS2. The birefringences of CuGaS2and CuInS2are not large enough to permit three-frequency phase matching within the transparent regions. A parametric oscillator threshold calculation for a pump wavelength 0.89 μ, which is within the range of the GaAs injection laser, indicates that AgGaS2is promising for this application. The upconversion efficiency in AgGaS2for sum mixing of the CO2laser (\\lambda = 10.5 \\mu) with the xenon ion laser (\\lambda = 0.597 \\mu) is also calculated. The result indicates that, depending upon system requirements and the availability of high optical quality material, AgGaS2can be comparable to ZnGeP2for upconversion. In Appendix II, we present a theory of the wedge technique for the measurement of nonlinear coefficients. This theory takes into account losses and assumes a Gaussian beam geometry. Furthermore, a discussion of units in nonlinear optics is given."
"In nonlinear optical crystals useful for second-harmonic generation, index inhomogeneities introduced by the self-induced temperature profile due to the laser beam influence the phase-matching conditions for nonlinear optical interaction. We have found that broadening of the width of the central peak, increase of asymmetry, shift of the maximum towards higher temperature, disappearance of the subsidiary structure in the second-harmonic power versus temperature, and the reduction of the conversion efficiency for second-harmonic generation may be caused. These effects depend upon the total absorbed power in the crystal, the birefringence variations due to temperature, the thermal conductivity, and the wavelength."
"The time-resolved intensities of hundreds of spontaneous-emission lines relating to four4plaser levels belonging to a doublet and the time dependences of electron temperature and density were measured under 10-μs pulse excitation at high currents. The pumping and decay rates were calculated only for the4pdoublet as a function of time. The influence of radiation trapping on the4sdoublet is discussed. It is shown that the ratio of the cascade pumping rate to the total pumping rate of the4pdoublet increases during the last half of a 10-μs pulse. Moreover, the relative important of the cascade transitions in the formation processes of the4p^{2}P_{3/2}laser level increases some what with time."
"It is shown that a reduction of more than an order of magnitude in electrooptic modulator drive power requirements should be possible at 10.6 μ by the use of a dielectric slab waveguide, despite the dimensional limitations imposed by electrode absorption."
"In a study of the mechanism of giant pulse amplification in Nd3+doped glass, the following measurements have been made: 1) energy extracted from an amplifier as a function of the input energy, 2) relative fluorescence intensity at 0.9μ in a slab, pumped by the emission of a ruby laser, and 3) gain variation after the transit of an intense, short, rectangular pulse. The experimental results have been compared to theoretical results from a model where both metastable and terminal levels are regarded as comprising two components. The unknown multiplicity of the lower component of the terminal level g11appears as a parameter. It is assumed that during the pulse duration, Boltzmann distribution is maintained between the components of each level. A finite terminal level lifetime τnmay be introduced in the model. Best agreement is obtained with the following values of the parameters: amplification cross section\\sigma_{21}\\simeq 1.8.10^{-20}cm2,g_{11} = 1or 2, and\\tau_{11} \\geq 100ns."
"The transmission ofQ-switched CO2laser pulses through SF6-He mixtures is studied experimentally and compared with predictions generated by computer calculations based on a four-state model for SF6. The results show that for saturating fields the factor determining the rate of absorption is the rotational energy transfer process that feeds the levels interacting with the laser. This conclusion has implications for models of passiveQswitching in molecular lasers and infrared-infrared double resonance."
"Laser action in BBD and isopropyl-PBD pumped by the N2laser has been observed. The energy outputs, optimum concentrations, and wavelength ranges for several ultraviolet-lasing dyes were also determined."
"Mode locking of a CO2laser through the use of cavity-length modulation is reported. A cavity end reflector was sinusoidally modulated along the cavity axis at a frequency equal to the quiescent axial mode interval. Phase-locked pulsing occurred at a rate equal to or twice the axial mode interval."
"PassiveQswitching of a CO2laser by saturable absorbers is analyzed in terms of a four-state kinetic model previously used to interpret infrared saturations double resonance, and pulse transmission. Good agreement is found between the predictions of this model and the experimental dependence of such variables as pulsewidth, repetition frequency, and peak power on the presence of buffer gases mixed in with the absorber."
"The wavelength at which the stimulated output from a number of electron-beam-pumped semiconductor lasers peaks is a function of the time after the start of the pumping pulse. In general, the output intensity reaches a maximum at short wavelengths considerably before it peaks at the longest. Detailed observations of the wavelength shifts of the peak output as a function of both time and pumping current are reported here for both CdSe and GaAs laser crystals. It is found that the rate of shifting of the wavelength peak (tuning rate) as a function of electron-beam pumping current is very similar in both functional form and magnitude in the two materials. Furthermore, the behavior of the tuning rate is dependent on whether or not lasing action occurs in the crystal under examination. For a crystal in which lasing action is obtained, the tuning rate saturates for pumping current densities above threshold. In contrast, for a nonlasing crystal, the tuning rate is a linearly increasing function of the pumping current density. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to previously reported work concerning shifts with respect to the band edge of the stimulated emission from semiconductor lasers."
"A theoretical model is developed that predicts the steady-state self-induced thermal distortion of a laser beam in an absorbing medium flowing transverse to the direction of propagation. A general perturbation solution is obtained that is appropriate when the thermal distortion effects are small. A computer iteration of this solution is performed to obtain results that are applicable over an increased range of distortion conditions. The effects of diffraction are neglected, and therefore the solution is limited to the near-field range of the laser beam or to a range where a caustic or infinite intensity is predicted as a result of the self-focusing associated with the thermal distortion effects of the flow. The thermal distortion of an initially Gaussian collimated laser beam causes a shift of the beam into the direction of the flow and, at the outset of the thermal effects, a decrease in the peak intensity. As the thermal distortion becomes more severe, the self-induced effects cause an increase in the peak intensity, i.e., a focusing to occur. Experimental results are presented for the thermal distortion of a CW CO2laser beam propagating in CS2that moves transverse to the propagation direction. The data verify the predicted beam deflection and the defocusing as well as focusing effects of the self-induced thermal distortion."
"Although there has been a large amount of experimental work published on the operation of the ring laser, nearly all of it was concerned with lasers operating in linearly polarized modes. In this paper the operation of a ring laser using the 1.153-μm wavelength transition of the He-Ne mixture in a cavity with no polarization constraint is reported. It was found that the two traveling waves operated in the same sense as circularly polarized modes and that there was no measurable coupling between the traveling waves via the amplifying medium, although there was still locking induced by coupling through cavity imperfections."
"Partial mode locking has been observed in self-pulsing GaAs injection lasers using an optical correlation technique. The lasers are operated at room temperature and the self-pulsing occurs near the end of the injection current pulse. The pulsewidths are about 4 ps, which are the shortest observed in an injection laser."

"A novel description, based on the Doppler effect, is given for laserQswitching by a rotating mirror. Fourier analysis yields a relation between the width of the pulse\\Deltat_{1/2}and the angular velocity of the mirror\\dot{\\theta}. It is shown that for laser emission having a Gaussian spatial amplitude profile the temporal shape of aQ-switched pulse is also Gaussian. It is predicted that for different lasersQswitched by mirrors rotating with the same\\dot{\\theta}, \\Deltat_{1/2}will depend on the wavelength of the laser. For a ruby laser, measurements are reported of\\Deltat_{1/2}versus\\dot{\\theta}for different configurations of the cavity into which vertical and horizontal slits were introduced."
"A Ge acoustooptic pulse modulator has been constructed and tested at 3.39 and 10.6 μm. A pulse rise time of 20 ns and deflection efficiency of 11 percent per watt of RF drive power when operating at 10.6 μm were realized."
"Previous analyses of the large signal operation of optical parametric oscillators have considered uniform plane-wave pump beams. These analyses are not adequate to describe the behavior of efficient pulsed oscillators pumped by beams having nonuniform intensity profiles and pulse durations that are short enough that the steady-state transverse modes of the oscillator cavity do not become established. This situation is typical of oscillators with plane-parallel cavities pumped byQ-switched lasers. This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates the behavior of such oscillators when pumped with beams having Gaussian intensity profiles. Each of the three basic external optical parametric oscillators are considered. For simplified cases it is shown that the response to a Gaussian pump beam is quantitatively and qualitatively much different than that predicted by the uniform plane-wave calculations. Experimental results in fair agreement with these calculations are presented. More importantly, uniform plane-wave behavior was observed by using an aperture to probe a small section of the pump beam transmitted through the oscillator. This useful technique gives a sensitive indication of the oscillator operation and, at present, it is the most accurate means of measuring thresholds in pulsed oscillators. As a result of our calculations and experiments, previous experimental observations that were puzzling are now well understood."
"A study of the nonlinear properties of cuprous halides in the near infrared (YAG Nd3+laser) and in the medium infrared (CO2laser) is presented. The second-order susceptibilities have been compared to those of quartz and GaAs. Coherence lengths were measured at 1.06 μ and for the four principal transition lines of CO2laser. In addition some linear parameters such as refractive indices in the visible and absorption coefficients from 0.3 to 25 μ were determined. The large values of Miller's δ14of those compounds are consistent with Levine's bond-charge model."

"The possibility of inducing sufficient birefringence in acentric cubic crystals to permit the phase matching of nonlinear infrared mixing is examined. It is shown that the electrooptic effect is inadequate for this, while phase matching by uniaxial stress is unlikely but cannot be ruled out."
"Time duration of the output pulse of electron-beam-pumped CdS laser was investigated. It increased with increase of the excitation current density and was of the order of 100 ns at the beam voltage of 25 kV. It was shown experimentally that the quenching of the laser oscillation is due to the rise of the threshold current density as the result of the temperature rise in the active region of the crystal. The expression for the duration of laser oscillation based on this model was derived and compared with the experimental results. The dependence of the duration on the excitation current density was explained by this model."
"A new type of the Schaefer-Bergmann diffraction patterns originated from the abnormal Bragg reflection phenomenon in anisotropic media has been demonstrated using α quartz and monoclinic Pb2MoO5crystals. The wave-vector direction of the diffracted light has been expressed in analytical equations for the general cases in uniaxial crystals as a function of those of the incident light beam and the acoustic wave, on the basis of the simple pseudo momentum conservation relation. The shape of the abnormal patterns can be determined using the equations and the known data on the acoustic and the optical wave-vector surfaces, and calculated patterns for α quartz are in good agreement with the observed ones. The equations predict that a small difference appears in the shape of the patterns between two cases where the polarization planes of the incident optical beams are orthogonal with each other, and this fact has been well confirmed by the present experiment."
"Saturated gain profile measurements in CO2at pressures where a Lamb dip appears in the laser intensity reveal that individual rotation-vibration transitions saturate with a strong Doppler component in addition to the Lorentzian holes expected for a Doppler broadened line. This mixed inhomogeneous-homogeneous behavior represents cross-relaxation effects induced by collisions that change the molecule's velocity. A rate equation formulation of collision effects elucidates the role of elastic and rotational thermalizing collisions on saturation and Lamb dip formation in molecular lasers."
"Acoustooptical guided-wave interaction in thin films is proposed as a mechanism for optical deflectors and antennas. The general characteristic of these devices is outlined here via the perturbation calculation of a sample case, namely the colinear interaction of the two guided waves."
"The effect on intracavity optical second-harmonic generation of additional laser transitions that compete for population inversion with the principal line is considered. It is shown that these transitions can limit the amount of harmonic generated unless some form of frequency-selective loss is provided. Parametric effects due to the presence of the second-harmonic radiation are also considered."
"Many authors have stated that electrostrictive self-trapping of the light beam initiates laser damage in solid transparent dielectrics. By systematically varying composition, it may be possible to find a glass in which electrostrictive effects are eliminated."
"Rapid bleaching of Rhodamine 6G and several other dyes has been observed in capillary-guide liquid lasers longitudinally pumped at\\lambda = 5145Å. This bleaching appears to be permanent and is shown to present a severe limitation to the operation of nonflowing continuously excited dye lasers. The rate of bleaching has been measured under a variety of conditions and is found to vary linearly with pump power, independent of geometry."
"The absolute intensities of 20 absorption bands between 2.5 and 0.25 μ have been measured for Nd:YAG at room temperature. These bands are forced electric dipole transitions between the4I_{9/2}ground manifold and 34 excitedJmanifolds of the Nd3+ion. The transition intensities have been accounted for in terms of three phenomenological parameters with an rms error of 10 percent. The intensity parameters are used to evaluate the line strengths for excited-state absorption from the metastable4F_{3/2} Jmanifold. Significant line strengths are predicted at wavelengths near 1.06 and 1.35 μ, suggesting the possibility of radiative depumping of the4F_{3/2}upper laser level via the stimulated emission field."

"The average output power of pulsed HF chemical lasers is found to depend strongly on the fluorine source used. The best performance was obtained from H2-C2F6-He mixes, which gave average powers of 850 mW and energies of 20 mJ/pulse. Peak gains of at least 0.036 cm-1are observed. Average powers of 450 mW from DF and 70 mW from HCl are reported."
"Preliminary experimental results are reported on the successful mating of an unstable confocal resonator with an HF chemical laser."
"An experimental investigation was conducted to reduce the parasitic noise appearing on the output of a 6-W CW YAG:Nd+3laser. Initially, low-frequency fluctuations as high as 30 percent and relaxation oscillation bursts exceeding 80 percent of the CW power level were present. Low-frequency modulation was reduced by the addition of an active feedback loop to control lamp current. Relaxation oscillations were determined to be influenced by laser rod cooling, pump-lamp aging, vibration, and intracavity optical interface quality. At the conclusion of the program, low-power fluctuations and relaxation oscillation excursions did not exceed 2 percent."

"Self-mode-locking of a cross-excited electrically pulsed CO2laser has been observed and studied as a function of cavity length and operating pressure. The best results are obtained at a pressure of 450 torr with cavity lengths on the order of 1m. Two-ns duration pulses have been measured, the shortest pulses observed to date at 10.6-μ wavelength. With longer cavities more axial modes are locked, resulting in a longer dead time between pulses; however, the pulsewidths increase with increasing cavity length. Mode-locking was not improved by the use of the bleachable absorber SF6."
 "A technique for the calculation of a thermal-lens aberration compensation in a CW Nd-YAG laser is presented. The results of an empirical verification are also given. An increase from 2 to 25 W in 1.06 μm TEM00power output was obtained after the crystal was compensated."
"Mode-locking of a krypton ion laser has been studied using a graphite-bore plasma tube and acoustooptic modulator In forced mode locking, 0.2-ns pulses were achieved with the principal laser lines. In contrast with the argon laser, there is a marked tendency for self-locking in krypton."

Also, a computation is made for a practical case and compared to experimental results."
"This paper describes the achievement of population inversion among the hyperfine levels in the ground state of Cs133by optically pumping these atoms with radiation from a GaAs diode laser. The laser output was used to monitor the populations in the two ground-state hyperfine levels as well as to perform the hyperfine pumping. By varying the injection current, a GaAs laser operated CW at about 77°K was used to scan the 8521-Å line of Cs133. The intensity of the resonance scattering from cesium vapor served as an indicator of the populations of the two levels involved. Experiments were performed both with neon-filled and with paraflint-coated cells containing the cesium vapor. It was discovered that the diode laser could easily be tuned by manually adjusting the injection current to match either of the hyperfine components of the D2optical transition. Possible future applications, including a restudy of the light shifts, the construction of a cesium maser, and the physics of optical pumping with coherent light are discussed."

"Breakdown threshold with ruby laser excitation has been determined for the gases Cl2, Br2, I2, ICl, NO, NO2, Hg, and C6H6, using argon as a reference. Our results indicate that threshold depends mainly on the ionization potential and that effects due to absorption in the visible region are secondary."
"The design of a new type of atmospheric pressure CO2-N2-He laser capable of producing 1.2-J infrared light pulses with a peak power of 0.5 MW is described. An investigation of the laser output dependence on gas flow, gas mixture, capacitor voltage, output coupling reflectivity, and electrode spacing was made. It is shown that even greater energies and powers should be possible at higher voltages and larger electrode gaps."
"Low-vibrational-levelP(J)_{\\upsilon,\\upsilon'}CO laser emissions have been measured from He-air-CH4mixtures. The CW lines below 5.0μ were measured in air to occur at 4.8836, 4.8935, 4.8974, 4.9072, 4.9366, 4.9466, 4.9670, and 4.9778μ. These emissions are tentatively identified to result from transitions as low as\\upsilon = 3 : 2. Such emissions were relatively more frequent with CH4than with CO specifically."
"An external inductance was placed in the circuit of a resistive transverse-excitation atmospheric discharge to observe its effect on the small-signal gain of a CO2-He-N2gas mix. The results of the measurements indicate that by lowering the inductance of the circuit, less helium is required in the gas in order to obtain a uniform discharge; consequently, more CO2and N2may be used with higher gains resulting."
"The differential equation for the attenuation of a light beam transmitted through a two-photon absorber is solved for two cases: 1) nonfluctuating or 2) Gaussian-fluctuating light beams. The two cases obey entirely different absorption laws. It is further shown that the fluctuation behavior changes throughout the absorption process. The fluctuations are characterized by the intensity autocorrelation functiong^{(2)}(0). It is seen that with increasing absorption the fluctuations of the transmitted beam diminish and the spectrum of the light is modified. Two-photon absorption (TPA) is compared with two-step absorption. The latter type is discussed qualitatively for several combinations of parameters. It is shown that for this case the deviation from a linear absorption law is small. Only when the lifetime of the intermediate state is short compared to the duration of the intensity fuctuation, can a change of the fluctuation behavior and of the spectrum result. These changes are much smaller than in the case of direct TPA."

"Lasing at 1.3 μ upon flash photolysis of 2-2-2 tri-fluoroethyliodide, CF3CH2I, has been observed on the2P_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}magnetic dipole allowed transition of atomic iodine. Using an 800-J flash, a maximum peak power output of approximately 108 W for 10-μs duration at half-maximum intensity was obtained with a pressure of 17 torr CF3CH2I."

                 "Data giving the parametric dependence of plasma-induced fluctuations termed random noise and striation oscillations are presented for CO2lasers and compared to He-Ne devices."
       "A computational approach has been formulated to predict the average pulsed power output of a continuously pumpedQ-switched YAG:Nd+3laser. Using this technique the dependence of laser operational characteristics on parametric changes can be readily evaluated:Q-switch mechanization, optimized output coupling reflectance, effects of intracavity losses, and pumping efficiency on average pulsed power are some of the more important items. This theory was checked experimentally using a 10-30-W multimode and 1.4-W TEM00mode laser operating at PRFs between 1 and 40 kHz; excellent correlation has been obtained."

Experimental results show that the 1.536-μm line oscillates under high-loss conditions whereas the 1.543-μm line oscillates under low-loss conditions. BothQ-switch and long-pulse data are included."
     "Experiments with a high-pressure transverse-discharge CO laser are described. The pulsed laser output was observed to occur on several CO rotational-vibrational transitions in bands from\\upsilon = 6 \\rightarrow \\upsilon = 5to\\upsilon = 11 \\rightarrow \\upsilon = 10. A study of the laser delay time versus CO pressure is presented and its relation to two inversion schemes is discussed in detail."
  "The 2.06-μm output of a holmium-doped silicon oxyapatite laser was successfully frequency doubled by means of a proustite single crystal. Frequency doubling to 1.03 μm permitted the use of anS1photomultiplier for the accurate determination of the laser wavelength, linewidth, and temporal behavior. The experiment also demonstrated that intracavity second-harmonic generation provided better amplitude correlation between the fundamental and second harmonic than did extracavity generation."
        "A physical model is considered to describe the gradual degradation of Zn-diffused GaAs electroluminescent diodes. This model is based on the postulation that new recombination centers are formed during the degradation process. Evidence of the formation of these new centers is established through the measurement of the injected carrier lifetime. Experimental variations of quantum efficiencies, current-voltage characteristics, and light-current curves resulting from degradation tests are obtained. These experimental data agree with the calculated results based on the proposed model."
"This paper is a theoretical examination of the frequency instabilities of the doubly resonant parametric oscillator. Such instabilities, caused by attempts to resonate simultaneously fields of two frequencies in unstabilized dispersive optical cavities, largely account for the poor performance of early parametric oscillators. The effects of reducing theQof one of the resonant cavities of the doubly resonant oscillator are treated in detail. An analysis is given that predicts the frequency instabilities resulting from the presence of a slight feedback at the nonresonant mode in a nearly singly resonant oscillator. The analysis shows that the nonresonant mode feedback must be completely eliminated to prevent double-cavity oscillator-frequency instabilities."
                  "The concept of spatial hole burning in the population inversion distribution of a solid-state laser was introduced by Tang et al in 1963 [3]. In this paper, several aspects of the spatial hole-burning effect in a CW Nd:YAG laser are discussed, both theoretically and experimentally. The number of oscillating modes, transverse mode degeneracy, and effects of sinusoidal phase perturbations are included. The measured number of oscillating modes is in good agreement with the theory based on the treatments of Tang et al. The transverse mode degeneracy causes an output power dip by quenching higher order modes through the spatial hole-burning effect. The positions of dips are calculated taking into account the thermal focusing effect in a pumped YAG rod. Effects of phase perturbations are discussed using nonlinear rate equations, and it is shown that two kinds of resonances peculiar to the Nd:YAG laser can be excited by a subharmonic sinusoidal drive."
  "A commercial argon laser was modified to radiate at a highly stable single frequency over a long time period. The long-term stability is obtained by controlling the mirror separation of the mode selector cavity, using the wavelength of a stabilized He-Ne laser as a reference. As a result the argon laser emits a maximum power of 450 mW at 4880 Å with a relative frequency stability\\Delta\\nu/\\nu = 2.10^{-8}over one half-hour operation."
      "Gain measurements have been performed on 80 rotation-vibrationP-branch transitions of the CO laser. With these data, the gas temperature and the Einstein coefficient, the absolute population densities of the laser level have been calculated for\\upsilon= 7, 8, 9."
             "The minimum longitudinal half-wave voltages are calculated for five oxygen-octahedral crystals with large linear electrooptic coefficients. The predicted values range from 11 kV (LiTaO3) to 75 V (BaTiO3). Experimental results have been obtained for LiNbO3and LiTaO3. The minima occur in directions with finite birefringence; the resulting limitations in angular aperture and temperture sensitivity are considered, and a compensation scheme to off-set them is discussed. The limiting operating frequency for uncompensated modulators can stem from joule heating in the transparent electrodes. The effect is evaluated and a figure of merit is derived. The values are surprisingly similar for the five crystals considered."
                      "A simple model describing repetitive passiveQswitching of a single-frequency laser with an intracavity saturable absorber is presented. Three coupled nonlinear rate equations are postulated to describe the inversion density of the amplifier, the inversion density of the absorber, and the photon density in the laser cavity. Each of the three variables is assumed to exhibit a simple exponential relaxation. By considering the linear equations describing small deviations about the expected equilibrium point, a condition on the various parameters is found that describes when repetitive pulsing will occur. Digital computer solutions are shown to verify this condition. Experiments with a CO2laser with an internal CO2absorber provide qualitative agreement with the model."
     "Stimulated emission spectroscopic methods were applied to investigate the electron-phonon interaction in Y3Al5O12and LaF3crystals activated with Nd3+ions. Temperature broadening and shifting of laser lines as well as the variation in the rate of nonradiative decay of the4I_{11/2}state were studied. For the Y3Al5O12-Nd3+crystal, the analysis of the results on temperature broadening and line shifting reveal an effective Debye temperature of ∼600 K for the spectrum of impurity-active phonons. This value of TDvery nearly corresponds to the energy of effective phonons (∼400 cm-1) which are responsible for the nonradiative decay of the4I_{11/2}state. For LaF3-Nd3+the effective TDvalues obtained by two different methods are 400 and 430 K, respectively. The temperature dependence of the threshold pumping energy for both laser crystals was computed theoretically. The physical factors governing this dependence are identified."
"The small-signal single-pass gain for 24 individual CO laser lines has been measured for a flowing CO-air-He laser. The vibrational-rotationalP(J)_{\\upsilon,\\upsilon'}lines considered were for rotational transitions fromJ = 10to 16 and upper vibrational levels from\\upsilon = 7to 11. The maximum gain was observed for theP(15)_{10,9}laser line, with an average logarithmic energy gain of2.633 \\times 10^{-3}cm-1."
"The most general expression for the half-wave voltage of a LiNbO3transverse light modulator has been studied. As a result, a novel cut with a minimum half-wave voltage of 1440 V for amplitude modulation is proposed. A preliminary experimental verification confirms the promising theoretical results."

"It is shown that internal damage in LiNbO3and KDP occurs at the same or lower levels of irradiation than surface damage. This is found in crystals used as frequency doublers and Pockels cells as well as in samples having different orientations. It is recommended, therefore, that samples that have suffered surface damage be thoroughly inspected internally before being repolished and reused. Internal filamentary damage in LiNbO3is shown to be composed of a series of very fine nearly planar cracks, which intersect to form one or more long lines having diameter\\approx 0.4 \\mu. When illuminated with visible light, diffraction effects make these lines appear blurred and give the impression of a tube of damaged material. Scanning electron micrographs of surface damage are included in this paper in order to show the very different characteristics of entrance and exit face damage and to reveal the importance of thermal effects as at least one cause of laser-induced damage."
"A detailed analysis is presented of the absorption of energy from a thin-film dielectric waveguide by an absorbing medium that is brought into contact with one wall of the dielectric guide. It is shown that the exponential decay constant for the mode of the guide so obtained can closely approach that obtained for the free wave in the absorbing medium alone. The dependence of the attenuation on the guide parameters is examined and means for overcoming some of the problems imposed by the guidance process are discussed. It is concluded that the techniques can offer greatly enhanced sensitivity over the conventional internal-reflection spectroscopy and yet retain the attractive features of small sample volume and easy sample preparation. The technique also offers the possibility of constructing microscopic probes for the examination of spectra in otherwise inaccessible places."
"Lasers can be made to oscillate simultaneously at two frequencies by means of anisotropic or nonreciprocal resonator elements. A technique is described for stabilizing the resulting frequency separation by locking it to an external frequency source. The stabilized separation should be useful in optical heterodyne applications."
"The theory of optical parametric oscillation internal to the laser cavity is extended to include the dynamics of the population inversion of the laser medium, thus generalizing it to include all laser-oscillator systems. The equations of motion of the oscillator-laser system are solved by digital computer for the case of aQ-switched Nd:YAG laser with a LiNbO3parametric oscillator inside the laser cavity. It is found that this internal optical parametric oscillator operates in a spiking regime, with one or more oscillator pulses per pump pulse. The oscillator pulses inside the nonlinear crystal are often more intense than the laser pulse that would have existed in the absence of parametric oscillation. Oscillator pulse lengths are much shorter than the laser pulse length, with oscillator pulse lengths of typically 5-10 ns compared to laser pulse lengths of 200 ns. The repetition rate of the oscillator pulses is pump-power dependent, with the pulses occurring more frequently as the laser field increases. The theoretical results are compared with experiment, and the analysis is found to provide a good qualitative description of theQ-switched parametric oscillator."
"Observation of single-wavelength operation in a TEM00mode laser at the 80-W level without the use of intracavity dispersive elements is reported. The output wavelength remains at theP(20)line irrespective of cavity length changes, gas mixture, and excitation level for cavity lengths of about 4 m or longer."
"A technique is described for operating a prism to dielectric thin-film waveguide system over a wide frequency band from a conventional broad-band source of the dye-laser type. The continuous coupling bandwidth can extend, typically, over a frequency range of twice to three times the center frequency. The experimental tolerances have been established and are shown to be within the capability of present-day technology."
"Experiments on IR laser action and gain measurements are reported for a CO2-containing gas mixture flow that cools as a result of expansion. The mixture is preheated by a reflected shock wave, and the gas is expanded into a vacuum through a slit. Laser action is obtained in a CO2-He mixture, while the addition of nitrogen increases the gain. The gain was found to depend on the distance from the slit and the gas pressure before the slit."

"The dissociation of carbon dioxide in the CO2laser discharge has been investigated by the infrared absorption method both in flowing and sealed systems. The role of CO2dissociation in creating the population inversion has been clarified."
"High-efficiency drivenQswitching of the CO2laser has been observed by the use of the Stark effect in CH3Cl, CH3F, CH3CHF2, CH2= CF2, and C2H3Cl on various lines in both the 9.4- and 10.4-μ bands. The effect is observed with both pulsed and sinusoidal electric fields applied to the intracavity modulator."
"Second-harmonic generation (SHG) of CO2laser radiation with tellurium has been investigated. The nonlinear coefficient was measured (d_{11} =1.6 \\times 10^{-6}ESU), as were the peak and average power damage thresholds (2-4 MW/cm2and 150 W/cm2). Finally, the SHG conversion efficiency was found to saturate due to increased absorption of the fundamental."
"An effect that is opposite to saturable absorption in the infrared was observed when a CO2laser beam was passed through SF6. An increase of absorption occurred when the radiant flux of the laser was increased to 10 W/cm2. The effect was observed for the P(28) line of the00\\deg1-10\\deg0band of the CO2laser, and was attributed to absorption from excited vibrational states of SF6."
"In this paper an investigation of the spectral line widths and shifts of Ar I and Ar II lines in argon ion laser plasma is carried out. The discharge-tube internal diameters were 5 and 7 mm, the current densities were 113, 163, and 242 A/cm2, and the pressures were 0.68, 0.42, and 0.23 torr. Approximate calculations were made of ion and electron temperatures, electron density, ion mean free path, and charge-exchange cross section. It was determined that ion-neutral charge-exchange collisions play an important role in this type of plasma."
"We have observed a rapid loss of helium from the discharge volume when operating certain types of sealed-off helium-cadmium laser tubes. In severe cases, a loss over a hundred times larger than that possible by diffusion through the glass walls has been observed. Experiments are described indicating that the lost helium is trapped in cadmium, which condenses on the tube walls in the vicinity of the active discharge. Possible trapping mechanisms are discussed. An improved discharge tube design is presented that effectively eliminates the helium cleanup."
"Inorganic liquids, phosphorous, and selenium oxychlorides, used as solvents for Nd, exhibit a number of nonlinear properties, which may reflect in the performance of liquid lasers. Spontaneous and stimulated Raman scattering have been studied. Measured cross sections and gains indicate that up to power levels of a few hundred megawatts per square centimeter the effect on laser and amplifier properties are negligible. No self-focusing has been observed. Under mode-locked conditions substantial conversion to Raman frequencies have been obtained. No connection has been found between stimulated Brillouin scattering and the phenomenon of self-Q-switching."
"Mode filters such as an intracavity tilted Fabry-Perot etalon, or an internal metallic film used to obtain a single-frequency output in the Nd:YAG laser, only work well for relatively short lasers (∼15 cm) and at reduced values of laser gain or output power level. Two new types of mode selectors for such single-frequency operation that largely overcome these difficulties are investigated here. These consist of a double metallic-film etalon in the laser cavity, or alternatively a combination of an intracavity tilted Fabry-Perot etalon and a single metallic-film reflector etalon. Both methods are considered in some detail and some experimental results are given on the single-frequency operation of a Nd:YAG laser with such mode filters. The relative advantages of the new mode selectors are enumerated and it is shown that the laser output may be taken through the metallic-film reflector etalon without serious loss."
"Strong laser emission is reported from a transverse discharge at relatively high pressure in both pure CO and CO-He at room temperature. Calculations of excited population distributions produced by electron CO collisions show an initial distribution that is approximately Boltzmann at a vibrational temperatureT_{\\upsilon}\\simeq 6700K. The laser emission spectra exhibit complete inversion. Time delay measurements are in good agreement with known V-V relaxation times in CO, and thep\\tauproduct shows the constancy expected of vibrational relaxation. The evolution of inversion from a near Boltzmann distribution can only be explained by anharmonic oscillator relaxation effects."
"Thermal effects in a Nd:YAG laser rod, which is pumped continuously by tungsten iodine lamps, are described. Measurements using a 0.6328-μman probe beam yielded temperature distribution in and at the boundary of the rod. The results of birefringence and focal length are consistent with theoretical treatments, if an effective heat conversion coefficient peculiar to the apparatus is assumed. The resonance condition of an optical resonator containing a rod exhibiting focusing effect is discussed."

"A flowing electrochemically excited liquid-nitrogen-cooled He-air-CH4-(CO) laser was operated inQ-switched fashion yielding 20 CO laser lines below 5.0 μ. These laser lines were measured to occur from 4.7848 to 4.9880 μ. The lines were all identified to result fromP(J)_{\\upsilon,\\upsilon'}CO vibrational-rotational transitions as low as\\upsilon = 2:1. Nine such\\upsilon = 2:1transitions were measured."
 "It is shown that the concept of flow lines on the Poincaré sphere is a useful tool in the study of mode polarization in lasers. As an example, a case from recent literature is analyzed."
"A new type of laser switching is discussed. The laser produces volume ionization in the path of a propagating streamer, increasing its velocity. Subnanosecond jitter is thereby obtained with pressurized gas switches."

"A rotating-waveplate optical frequency shifter using lithium niobate (LiNbO3) has been constructed and fully evaluated. The experimental modulator frequency shifts the incoming 6328-Å light by 110 MHz, requires 15 W of drive power, and has an inherent 12-MHz bandwidth. The output beam has high spectral purity with very little power in unwanted sidebands and closely matches the TEM00mode of the input beam. An analysis of the effects of electrical and optical maladjustments on modulator performance shows only moderate requirements on optical and electrical alignment. Heating due to the absorbed drive power slightly degrades the modulator in agreement with a temperature analysis of the modulator. An increase in insertion loss due to diffraction of the light by acoustic waves in the LiNbO3crystal was observed."
"The behavior of the classical degenerate parametric oscillator (\\omega_{i} = \\omega_{s}) with small linear dissipation is considered and an expression for the steady-state probability distribution for the subharmonic amplitude is obtained. The treatment is limited to the case1 \\ll Q_{p} \\ll Q_{s}where Qpand Qsare theQfactors at respectively the pump and signal frequencies. The behavior is analogous to that of the Brownian motion of a particle in a bistable potential well. This leads to a tractable equation for the relaxation towards the steady-state distribution by thermally activated jumps over the barrier. Near threshold, the behavior is similar to that of a system undergoing a second order phase transition in the mean field approximation. Analogies between first-order phase transitions and transitions in oscillating systems are also pointed out."
"The 90° polarization flip with hysteresis effect is observed at zero magnetic field in the CW 337-μm HCN laser. The flip disappears when the pressure is increased. In order to obtain the flip, it is necessary that under a constant pressure the input is larger than a threshold input at which the flip appears."
"In optical nonlinear crystals used for second-harmonic generation the presence of absorption at the fundamental wavelength can lead to index of refraction inhomogeneities that reduce the conversion efficiency."
"Earlier measurements and level assignments made by the authors for some xenon ion laser lines are reevaluated in light of recent work by Gallardo and coworkers. The lines affected are the 5260.17-, 5260.43-, 4305.75-, and 3759.94-Å lines in xenon and 4647.40- and 4650.22-Å lines attributed to carbon."
"A simple statistical model of a noisy optical pulse is used to derive concise analytic expressions for the contrast ratios of nonlinear pulsewidth measurements. The results are sufficiently general to be used as an aid in the interpretation of intensity correlation experiments using eitherNth-order multiphoton absorption orNth-order harmonic generation. The amplitude of the spike is expected to be much larger in the higher order experiments."
"Spectroscopic observations were made on Lu:Nd:YAG and Nd:YAG laser materials. Variations in the UV absorption strengths are described and related to the presence of Lu3+. These results indicate that an optimum Lu/Nd ion ratio exists that will yield minimum absorption by the host over the wavelength range0.4-0.24 \\mum. The reduction in absorption will minimize nonuniform heating effects that should lead to better laser performance under certain conditions."
"Experimental results on the active mode locking of a transversely excited N2O laser at subatmospheric pressures are presented. Nanosecond pulses of 10.8-μ radiation were produced with typical peak-power outputs in the 100-kW range."
"Measurements of the small signal gain and saturation intensity of a CO2-N2-He laser are made as a function of gas flow velocity over the range from\\sim 0-10m/s. The small signal gain increases and the saturation intensity decreases with increased gas velocity. For intermediate flow velocities with a gas transit time in the laser of a second, the gain also depends on the direction of propagation of the amplified beam with respect to the gas flow. The directional dependence is due to an axial gradient in the saturation intensity. The transit time of the gas in the 2.5-m amplifier spans the time required for appreciable generation of CO by dissociation of the CO2and the variation of the laser gain with velocity is attributed to the effects of CO on the inversion of the laser medium."
"An electrooptic mode-locking technique for inducing simultaneous oscillation of spacially congruent, orthogonally polarized CO2laser modes is described. During mode-locked dual-polarization operation the frequency separation of the output components is determined by the magnitude of an intracavity birefringence. It can therefore be adjusted to any value consistent with the gain-profile width. The sensitivity of the technique is such that for intermode frequencies between 1 and 20 MHz, a3 \\times 10^{-4}radian intracavity phase modulation suffices to produce continuous, stable dual-polarization operation. Experimental results are given that indicate the dependence of the mode-locking phenomenon on modulator drive, intermode frequency, and laser cavity tuning. These results are compared with the prediction of simple theory."

"A coaxial spark gap triggered by a high-pressure CO2laser has been constructed. High-voltage pulses with subnanosecond rise time and very low jitter have been obtained. The observed low-laser energy threshold required to initiate switching suggests an application of the spark gap in controlling and manipulating high-intensity infrared radiation by electrooptic shutters."
"Fluorine atom laser oscillation has been observed at 0.7311 μ. The line was excited by pulsed electric discharge in mixed helium-fluorine gases at 5 torr and was accompanied by stronger, previously reported fluorine atom lines at 0.7039 and 0.7129 μ."
"The Fairchild graphical layout system is a design tool for the layout and production of masks for large-scale integrated circuits. Its purpose is to reduce the time delay from the specification of a circuit design in schematic form to the production of a set of masks to be used in the manufacturing process. The system operates on an IBM 1130 computer with 16K 16-bit words of core memory. A Sanders display system built to Fairchild specifications makes possible rapid graphic man-machine interaction. An entire design may be carried out at the display or portions of it may be entered through punched cards. Final output consists of masks cut on a Calcomp plotter, line drawings, and/or digital images of the design which may be saved for later use and modification, or for output on other media (e.g., reticle generators). The use of a grid system for determining coordinate positions together with software windowing and scaling has produced a layout design package that is easy to use and provides rapid response to user requests with a relatively small low-speed computer. The graphical layout system produces circuit layouts with resolutions that are an order of magnitude greater than the resolution of the CRT display."
"The adjoint network approach to automated network design as presented by Director and Rohrer is extended for use in gradient calculations for noncommensurate networks. The networks can contain distributed elements such as uniform transmission lines andRClines. An example investigates gradient computations for a noncommensurate microwave network having 13 variable parameters."
"A simple procedure for computer evaluation of the constituent matrices is introduced. The power of this procedure lies in the ease of generating the constituent matrices where the characteristic polynomial has a number of multiple-order zeros."
 "Methods for the generation of multitrees of the general typeT_{v_{1}, v_{2}, \\cdots , v_{i}, \\cdots , v_{k}}, whereV_{i}may consist of several nodes, are given in which a tree-testing procedure is primarily required and for which storage of complete sets of trees, subtrees, cut-sets, or multitrees is not required if a digital computer is being used."
  "The mutually reciprocal adjoint network associated with a given lumped linear time-invariant network has been shown to be an extremely useful aid for the computation of network sensitivities in automated network design algorithms. The fact that the nodal admittance matrix of the mutually reciprocal adjoint network is the transpose of the nodal admittance matrix of the given network can be employed, along with theLUfactorization of a matrix, to considerably reduce the computational effort necessary to calculate all the firstorder network sensitivities."
"A method is developed that allows the direct calculation of the least-squares estimates of the poles and residues of the transfer function of a linear system when the input and output of the system is represented in a sequential numerical format. The method is particularly adaptable to implementation on a digital computer and is quite efficient for problems of moderate size."
 "An efficient method of modifying the state equations, frequency response, and element sensitivities in a linear active network is presented for arbitrary variations in several parameters."
"Circuit simulation programs are already accepted as indispensable efficient supplements to traditional breadboarding, which, moreover, in many instances afford more insight and flexibility. Sensitivity and optimization are beginning to make significant inroads as well, already impacting many realistic design problems. Filter design and layout appear to be almost entirely dependent on the computer. These five areas are discussed in detail in five review papers written by the associate guest editors, D.O. Pederson, S.R. Parker, S.W. Director, G. Szentirmai, and C.H. Mays. The associate guest editors were also responsible for the review of manuscripts in their respective areas. Rapid progress is the watchword; the papers of this issue show where the action in computer-aided design (CAD) of circuits is, or was, by the time it is published. It seems safe to predict that the next technological step will be a blurring of the boundaries between the above mentioned computer-aided circuit design subareas."
"Various optimization techniques have encouraged the use of the computer as an active partner in the design of networks. A review of some of these techniques is presented."
"Computer-aided design of integrated circuits is discussed. Emphasis is placed on automated layout of systematic chips using building blocks. References are made to less automated approaches using CRTs and languages for describing masks."
"The general problem of circuit sensitivity with emphasis upon computational aspects is discussed. After a historical classical review, multiparameter sensitivity is considered. Statevariable sensitivity and sensitivity models, including nonlinear circuits, are then discussed and correlated to the mutually reciprocal adjoint circuit. Interpretation of sensitivity functions in the time domain and minimum sensitivity equivalent networks are also discussed."
"The role of the digital computer in various phases of electric filter design is summarized in this review paper. It is pointed out that as the computer made it possible to design more and more sophisticated and complicated filters, more numerical problems arose that necessitated new theoretical advances in the field. Brief descriptions of these new developments as well as assessments of the present situation are given for conventional passive,RC-active, and digital filters."
"Sparse matrix storage and solution techniques are used extensively in solving very large systems of hundreds of linear equations which arise in the analysis of multiply interconnected physical systems. These techniques have often been overlooked in the analysis of relatively small electric networks even though their use can result in very significant improvements in computer storage requirements and execution times. The time savings is particularly noticeable when many solutions for the same circuit with different parameter values are required. particular sparse matrix storage, reordering, and solution technique is described. A node renumbering algorithm which is specifically directed at preserving the sparse structure of nodal admittance matrices during the solution by Gaussian elimination is described in detail. Computer flow charts for the renumbering are included along with specific circuit examples which compare the relative computational effort required for sparse solution versus full matrix solution."
"Both ac and dc automated network design algorithms have been shown to be feasible and practical in the design of lumped linear networks. The present paper extends and combines these algorithms to integrated circuit amplifiers, where the ability to \"grow\" transistors to attain specified design goals is mandatory. In particular, it is shown that under the reasonable assumption that certain fabrication parameters are held fixed, suitable design parameters for transistors are the area and the perimeter of the emitter and the dc collector current. Transistor models can be derived in terms of these parameters. The rather general ac-dc design algorithm described allows transistors to grow to meet ac specifications; dc design requirements arise naturally. Two examples are used to show the tractability of the approach: 1 ) a differential pair of transistors is designed for given ac and dc specifications; 2) a cascade amplifier is designed for specified gain, bandwidth, and input and output impedances. The latter example requires the growth of common-base and common-collector transistors."
"Two design concepts are discussed which have been implemented as new computer-aided design tools. The first concept is that of large-change sensitivities which are a significant departure from the classical first-order sensitivities. The second concept is that of a performance contour which is, in effect, a second-order largechange sensitivity. The information provided by large-change sensitivities and performance contours is applicable in the phase of design after an acceptable nominal design has been found. Applications of this information to desensitize a design, to specify tolerances, and to indicate parameter correlation with respect to the performance criteria are discussed. The correlation information is useful not only in specifying tuning component matching but also in determining whether a design is consistent with expected statistical correlations in manufacture or in the field. Two real-world examples, some useful properties of contours, and a brief description of the program are included."
"A number of choices must be made in the implementation of a general-purpose program for analysis of nonlinear dynamic circuits. The numerical considerations which bear upon selection of 1) integration variables, 2) an equation formulation procedure, 3) a numerical integration algorithm, and 4) an equation ordering scheme are detailed. Results of implementation of a node-analysis-based program are presented."
"Two efficient computer algorithms are presented for finding the dc solutions of resistive nonlinear networks containing two-terminal linear and nonlinear resistors, independent dc voltage and current sources, and linear controlled sources. The first algorithm is designed specifically for networks with multiple solutions, while the second algorithm is designed for networks with a unique solution. The first algorithm is based on the sign of the hybrid parameters associated with the linear n-port portion of the network. The second algorithm is a piecewise-linear version of the Newton-Raphson method, but it differs from the differentiable version in two important aspects. First, rather than diverging to\\pm \\infty, as in the usual case, the divergence phenomenon of the piecewise-linear algorithm takes the form of a cyclic repetition of two or more segment combinations. Second, the iteration formula depends not directly on the solution at the preceding iteration, but on the updated segment combination. These observations lead to an algorithm which assures that the piecewise-linear version of Newton-Raphson formula will always converge. Moreover, an important connection between the two algorithms is established on the basis that the iteration formula for the second algorithm is identical to the network equations associated with the first algorithm."
"Upon defining a suitable scalar performance index to measure the error between desired and actual bias levels in a given circuit configuration, well-known unconstrained minimization algorithms may be made to correspond to circuit design algorithms. The design parameters for the problem considered are taken here to be a subset of the circuit resistance values. An automatic design package has been developed, and examples of computer implemented designs are presented."
"A unified method for handling the mixed differential and algebraic equations of the type that commonly occur in the transient analysis of large networks or in continuous system simulation is discussed. The first part of the paper is a brief review of existing techniques of handling initial value problems for stiff ordinary differential equations written in the standard formy' f(y, t). In the second part one of these techniques is applied to the problemF(y, y', t)=0. This may be either a differential or an algebraic equation as\\partial F/ \\partial y'is nonzero or zero. It will represent a mixed system when vectors F and y represent components of a system. The method lends itself to the use of sparse matrix techniques when the problem is sparse."
"A generalized algorithm for forming interconnections between points on a multilayer circuit board is described and evaluated. The algorithm treats interconnections on individual layers and connections between layers by means of plated holes. Generalizing the well-known Lee algorithm and using its terminology, this algorithm makes use of a coded C array that is stored in memory and records the state of the multilayer circuit board. Completed paths, possible remaining paths between points to be connected, and circuitboard interconnection restrictions are recorded in the coded C array. The algorithm consists of five iterative steps that involve decisions on the basis of the state of the circuit board as stored in the C array. All possible routes are attempted, and the routing sequence is stopped when the path is completed or all attempted path routes are exhausted. A number of modifications to the algorithm permitting various circuit connection constraints to be satisfied are also presented. The algorithm has been programmed for a GE-635 computer. Typical results for some of the printed circuit boards that were used to evaluate the algorithm are included."
"The tableau approach to automated network design optimization via implicit, variable order, variable time-step integration, and adjoint sensitivity computation is described. In this approach, the only matrix operation required is that of repeatedly solving linear algebraic equations of fixed sparsity structure. Required partial derivatives and numerical integration is done at the branch level leading to a simple input language, complete generality and maximum sparsity of the characteristic coefficient matrix. The bulk of computation and program complexity is thus located in the sparse matrix routines; described herein are the routines OPTORD and 1-2-3 GNSO. These routines account for variability type of the matrix elements in producing a machine code for solution ofAx=bin nested iterations for which a weighted sum of total operations count and round-off error incurred in the optimization is minimized."
"The key to the efficient automated design and optimization of nonlinear networks is the sensitivity vector. The sensitivity vector is a measure of the performance of the network with respect to the changes of the design parameters. A derivation of the sensitivity vector for nonlinear networks containing transmission lines is presented. If the transmission lines are either lossless or dispersionless, the network can be characterized by a set of differential-difference equations. Variational techniques are used to derive a set of equations which is adjoint to the original set. Solving both sets of equations only once suffices to obtain the desired sensitivity vector for all possible design parameters. The adjoint network approach is then considered. It is shown that transmission lines are self-adjoint and that the initial waves stored on the transmission lines in the adjoint network are always identically zero. For purpose of evaluation, an experimental program based on the preceding methods was written and the results were compared to the (less efficient) method of direct parameter partubation for a problem involving a switching circuit containing transmission lines. Good agreement was observed."
"A set of new models of varying complexity and accuracy is derived for the large-signal transient behavior of bipolar transistor and diode structures found in integrated circuits. The derivation starts with the defining equations of the so-called nonlinear model for the four-layer integrated-circuit transistor and proceeds by reformulating several terms in these equations to remove, in effect, current sources in the symbolic model dependent on the complex frequency variablesThe removal of this dependence yields models containing resistors, capacitors, and nonfrequency-dependent sources. With the availability of these models, network-analysis programs unable to accommodate frequency-dependent sources become directly applicable to the computation of the large-signal transient behavior of bipolar integrated circuits. Considerations pertaining to practical application guide the choice of approximations used in the derivation. The limits of validity of these approximations and of others that set the range of validity of the resulting models receive careful attention."
"An approach for the static modeling and analysis of nonlinear networks is presented. First, the piecewise-linear approximation of static characteristics of multiport devices is discussed in connection with the multidimensional linear interpolation technique. Next, two algorithms for solving general piecewise-linear resistor networks are given. The results obtained are of great effect for the dc analysis of nonlinear networks, in particular, with coupled elements such as transistors."
"A general classification of reactive ladder filters with real transmission zeros is given which is based on the extreme frequency behavior of port impedances and on types of design polynomials of the characteristic and effective transmission functions. It is shown that this classification provides an ordered algorithm for automatic realization of ladder structures which can be used to construct a logical development of appropriate computer programs. The bilinear frequency transformation is extended to all filter classes for a synthesis procedure entirely in the transformed plane. Accuracy limitations of this method are discussed and reasons for them are pointed out. A recently developed method of filter synthesis is proposed, which does not require high accuracy working in a computer because it operates throughout with simple factors which are never multiplied into polynomials. A design example of a through-supergroup filter is offered which demonstrates limitations of standard synthesis procedures."
"An important part of preproduction design evaluation of networks requiring tuning at the test site is to demonstrate that they can be tuned to specifications by manual methods. A computeroriented tuning strategy is described that uses response sensitivity to component variations to select a best component at each stage as well as its direction of movement and size of adjustment. This method is superior to pattern-search techniques and sequential linear-search procedures. Computation time is considerably reduced by the use of sensitivity data to predict network responses."
"The recent theoretical results of Liniger and Willoughby have been applied to the transient analysis of linear time-invariant networks possessing large time-constant spreads. In our approach we accept a compromise situation where an acceptable loss of integration accuracy for the slowly varying components of the solution (with respect to an arbitrarily specified integration time steph) is incurred, but where the rapidly varying components of the solution (again with respect toh) are proportionally \"killed off.\" This is accomplished by the selection, in some optimal way, of a free parameter characterizing a family of linear one-step numerical integration formulas."
"A computer program has been developed for the simultaneous optimization of turnon and turnoff in emitter-coupled logic (ECL) logic gates. For given transistor models, the biasing resistors and dc voltage source values are automatically adjusted such that the actual response is as close as possible to the desired response."
"A description of a statistical method for studying the relations among tolerance fields in the frequency and time domain is presented. The methods concerning this problem presented up to now have not been constructed on a statistical base. The given method is useful especially in the cases where the closed solution is difficult or impossible."
 "A three-part model of the differential input, singleended output operational amplifier is developed for use with ECAP dc, ac, and transient circuit analysis programs, respectively. The values of the model components are easily obtainable from information provided on manufacturers' data sheets. Amplifier parameters included in the model are input impedance, output resistance, voltage gain and phase shift as functions of frequency, amplifier input currents, offset voltage, common mode rejection ratio, and slew rate."
 "A computer-aided mask layout system is described. The purpose of the system is to assist the designer in making the transition from logic diagram or circuit schematic to camera-ready artwork. The system is used for device design, device layout, cell layout, and layout of integrated circuits up through large-scale integration (LSI). Techniques used for placement and routing include an automatic system, a CRT system, and an off-line digitizer (or card) input system. Output is from a precision photo plotter and an ink plotter. The layout system runs on a small-scale (16 thousand words) digital computer; the hardware cost of operation is relatively low. When the layout system is utilized properly, benefits are obtained in the areas of shorter design time, lower cost design, elimination of layout errors, and the capability of laying out circuits that could not be done with older techniques. Development of LSI, particularly of custom LSI, has added importance to new design procedures."
"Hachtel et al. [1], [2] have recently proposed sparse matrix methods for nonlinear analysis incorporating an algorithm that generates symbolic code which, when executed, solves a system of linear equations of arbitrary, but particular, sparseness structure. They point out that the execution time and storage requirements of this code are critically dependent upon the ordering selected for processing the network equations and variables, and have themselves developed ordering methods. An efficient ordering algorithm is presented which tends to minimize the length and execution time of this symbolic code. Although the algorithm takes full advantage of the unique character of the sparse system that arises from a certain nonlinear circuit analysis representation, it is flexible enough to be used efficiently for ordering sparse matrices with different characteristics. In particular, it is especially appropriate when solving repetitively the large sparse systems which appear in circuit analysis in general, nonlinear differential and discrete system analysis, and in systems of linear or nonlinear algebraic equations. These problems are often part of larger problems or simulations. The algorithm contains parameters that may be easily adjusted to vary the tradeoff between ordering time and ordering efficiency. The method can (and should) be generalized to include some pivoting for numerical accuracy. Results for a typical nonlinear network indicate considerable improvement over previously published ordering schemes."
 "A survey is made of the principal techniques, procedures, and routines that are used in present programs for computeraided circuit analysis. Programs (simulators) are reviewed and selected features compared for the four major classes of circuit analysis: linear dc and ac, nonlinear dc, nonlinear transient, and linear pole zero."
"Explicit formulas are derived for elliptic function prototype networks in a direct and simple manner without recourse to continued-fraction expansion techniques. The natural prototype for the - elliptic function filter incorporates the concept of frequency invariant reactances and impedance inverters from which relatively narrow bandwidth, bandpass, or bandstop filters may be readily derived using the reactance slope parameter method. Formulas are given for the general arbitrary gain case where the zeros of the reflection coefficient are located in one half-plane or equally distributed between the two half-planes, and the degenerate cases of maximum gain and operation from a zero impedance generator are specifically recovered. The corresponding results are also presented for the inverse Chebychev response."
"Bounds on the attenuation characteristics of\\overline{URC}networks which have unity transmission at zero frequency and consist of cascaded sections with or without stubs are established."
"AnRC-active-network synthesis method described by Bruton for the realization of low-pass filters is extended to the case of bandpass filters. Networks are obtained which use frequency-dependent negative-resistance (conductance) elements as active elements, and these can be realized by using generalized-immittance converters (GICs). In turn, GICs can be implemented by using operational amplifiers. The method is illustrated by designing a sixth-order bandpass elliptic filter; experimental results are also given."
"A new and practical technique for synthesizing arbitrary rational admittance matrices is presented. Of special interest is the inclusion of theRCconstraints and the ability to include the frequency-dependent nonideal controlled-source models in the synthesis procedure."
 "Two similar methods have recently been proposed to obtain zero active sensitivities by using redundant elements, including a redundant amplifier, inRC-amplifier resonators. It is shown that the passive sensitivities are somewhat higher after gain compensation."
 "A simple lumped component diode model is presented including a representation of conductivity modulation, in addition to the usual characterization by diffusion capacitance, transition capacitance, and an ideal junction. It is shown that this model employed in a switching circuit exhibits the overshoot and oscillation characteristic of diodes at high forward currents, as well as the usual charge storage effects for the reverse transient. Using small-signal analysis it is shown that in some cases the model possesses an inductive impedance which is also characteristic of diodes at high forward currents."
"Criteria for minimizing the number of independent variables in the mixed method of circuit analysis are proposed. The dependence of this number on both the topological and electrical properties of a general network is discussed. Special emphasis is given to the requirements of computational accuracy and speed which are present in computer-aided design."
 "The problem of minimizing the number of simultaneous equations to be solved in the application of the mixed method of network analysis is considered. The dependence of this number upon the topological properties of the network is investigated."
"The following problem is investigated. Given two terminating impedancesZ_{1}andZ_{2}, design anRCladder network of n sections such that the terminated transfer voltage ratio|V_{2}/V_{1}(j \\omega_{0})|is maximized at a given phase shift(\\angle V_{2}/V_{1}(j \\omega_{0})=\\phi_{0}). This problem is solved explicitly. It was found that the optimumRCphase-shift network is a geometrical progression network-properly terminated at both ends. In the distributed case (napproaches infinity), the optimumRCnetwork is an exponentially tapered line, terminated by four lumped impedances."
  "A new algebraic criterion for positive realness of real rational functions which is formulated entirely in terms of the Routh scheme is presented. Due to the outstanding algebraic simplicity of the Routh algorithm, the criterion yields an efficient and completely recursive numerical procedure for testing nonnegativity (positivity) of real polynomials which is suitable for machine calculations."
 "The applicability of the classical Bott-Duffin synthesis technique to a class of multivariable positive real functions is discussed, and the results arrived at are illustrated by an example."
"Complete solution is given to the problem of realizing, with the minimum possible number of elements, a biquadratic nonminimum phaseRCvoltage transfer function, having zeros anywhere in thesplane. All possible equivalent realizations are discussed, and it is shown that there exists a great flexibility in choosing the network elements."
  "Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for two nonlinear reciprocal locally controllable networks to be equivalent. The controllability definition is borrowed from a classical work of Caratheodory, whereas the representation of reciprocal networks is due to Brayton and M\\bar{o}ser."
"The Paley-Wiener criterion states necessary and sufficient conditions which a square integrable amplitude gain of a linear system has to satisfy in order that the impulse response is causal. These conditions are extended to the case of an impulse response which is a slowly growing or Laplace transformable generalized function."
"An extension of Vratsanos' theorem to nonreciprocal networks is considered. It is shown that for an impedanceZ_{0}carrying a currentI_{0}, \\partial Z_{0} / \\partial Z^{(n)} = I^{(n)}I^{(n)}' / I_{0}^{2}; whereI^{(n)}andI^{(n)}'are branch currents through an elementZ^{(n)}in conjugate networks obtained from each other by gyrator coupling reversals."
 "The flat time delay polynomials are given as a solution of a second-order ordinary differential equation with eigenvalues. The study of this differential equation and its associated matrix provides knowledge of the multiplicity of the solutions and the general location of their roots. Insight on the more general problem of equal ripple time delay is also obtained. Data are given for use as bandpass filter functions."
"A method by which the element values can be expressed for a class of linear lumped passive resistively terminatedLCnetworks, in terms of the poles and zeros of the reflection coefficient, is described. The driving-point impedance of the networks belonging to this class has the property that the zeros of its even part are all located at infinity in thepplane. The method to be described is broken down into two distinct steps: the first step consists of finding the element values in terms of the power series coefficients of the drivingpoint function and the second step consists of expressing the power series coefficients of the driving-point impedance in terms of the poles and zeros of the corresponding reflection coefficient or the Taylor series coefficients of the return loss function. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the method. The method can be easily extended to the cases in which all the even-part zeros lie at the origin or at any other finite frequency on thej \\omegaaxis."
"The minimumm-degree vulnerability criterion introduced by Boesch and Thomas is explored in more detail, and their results are extended by utilizing the properties of the girth of a graph."
"In the design of printed and integrated circuits it is desirable to minimize the number of jumpers and via-holes. Linear graph theory provides apparatus useful in the formal specification and solution of this problem. Prior work has concentrated on the drawing of graphs in a single plane. This correspondence, however, is concerned with determining the minimum number of crossings for two subgraphs of a graph whose union is the entire graph. The two subgraphs correspond to the two sides of a printed circuit board or to two layers of metalization on an integrated circuit. An upper bound on this crossing number and a model yielding this bound have been found for complete graphs."
  "For a large class of operators of the form[F(\\cdot)+A],in whichAis a not necessarily nonsingular realn \\times nmatrix, andF(\\cdot)is a diagonal strictly monotone-increasing mapping of the set of all realnvectorsE^{n}onto an open subset ofE^{n}, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under whichF(\\cdot)+A]possesses a global inverse onE^{n}. Operators of the type[F(\\cdot)+A]frequently arise in the analysis of nonlinear networks and are encountered in other areas as well. In particular, forAthe short-circuit conductance matrix of a resistance network, andF(x)the transpose of(f_{1}(x_{1}), f_{2}(x_{2}), \\cdots , f_{n}(x_{n}))for allx \\in E^{n}in which thef_{j}(\\cdot)are the usual exponential diode functions, we give a complete solution to the problem of determining whether or not[F(\\cdot)+A]possesses an inverse onE^{n}."
"A frequency-domain stability criterion is given for networks containing lumped linear time-invariant components, uniformLCtransmission lines, and time-varying memoryless nonlinear components. When only one nonlinear component is present, the criterion becomes the familiar critical disk criterion."
"A reliable algorithm is described for calculation of the initial condition state vector as formulated in network transient analysis programs. The algorithm is based on a combination of Davidenko's parameter-stepping method and Broyden's method. It has been found to give fast reliable solutions even in cases for which most Newton-Raphson methods fail to converge, as well as for circuits that produce singular systems of equations at the starting point."
 "A recurrence relation for the number of spanning treesf(n)in the wheelW_{k},wheren \\geq 3, is obtained asf(n+1)-f(n)=L_{2^{n}+1},wheref(3)=16and whereL_{k}is thekth number in the Lucas series1, 3, 4, 7, \\cdots , L_{k}, \\cdots ,whereL_{k} = L_{k+1} L_{k-1}fork > 1.

"An all-pole functionT(s)is presented which has a squared-magnitude low-pass characteristic that is maximally flat at\\omega = bwhereO \\leq b < 1. Expressions for the poles ofT(s)are given in closed form, and it is shown that they are located on ovals of Cassini.|T(j |omega)|^{2}is compared with the Butterworth and Chebyshev functions."
"A new class of selective nonrecursive digital filters with a maximally flat frequency response in the passband and stopband is introduced. The proposed design method is based on a special solution of the general Hermite polynomial interpolation and allows computation of the parameters of these filters in closed form. Therefore it yields some advantage over numerical iterative methods. Design examples are given and an extension to the design of unsymmetrical bandpass systems is made."
"A function is presented which has properties that lie between those of the Butterworth and Chebyshev functions."
"The use of active elements in linear networks offers new degrees of freedom to both network and system designers. A comprehensive report on the Biquad, an active topology based on analog computer concepts, is given. We describe the electrical characteristics of the Biquad that make it a manufacturable realization for precision networks. Analysis and experimental data describe the dependence of Biquad performance on nonideal operational amplifiers. Compensation techniques are derived which allow high-Qoperation at several hundred kilohertz with existing devices. The 8-V rms signal capacity and 80-dB dynamic range of the voice-frequency Biquad are illustrated."
"While the electrical performance of the Biquad insures that active filter designs using this structure will be useful over a wide range of conditions, the Biquad topology offers unique flexibility compared to other active realizations. We now present the concept of the multipurpose active filter. For example, switchable and adaptive filters are easily realized and different functions (e.g., bandpass and band-reject) are obtainable simultaneously from the same structure."
"In this investigation the necessary and sufficient conditions are established for a2 \\times 2matrix of real rational functions to be realizable as a short-circuit admittance matrix of a transformerless active three-terminal two-port network utilizing either\\pm R, CorRCnetworks and one controlled source. An existence theorem on this general class of networks is presented, but no general synthesis procedure is developed. For the special case when the matrix has only simple real axis poles, a synthesis procedure is developed to realize the admittance matrix that satisfies these sufficient conditions as a twoport network. As an application of the synthesis procedure, an equivalent circuit is developed from a set of short-circuit admittance functions which are obtained by approximating a set of experimentally determined magnitude and phase characteristics using the half-line approximation technique. This application provides a method for obtaining general equivalent circuits for a transistor or any other similar active device, valid over any desired frequency range with any degrees of predetermined accuracy by synthesis."
"A novel technique is used to derive networks termed converter-inverter circuits. These are 5-ports that can be used to produce any of the following four basic circuits encountered in active network theory: positive impedance converters, negative impedance converters, positive impedance inverters, and negative impedance inverters. Thus a converter-inverter circuit is a very general network; this generality of the circuit demonstrates that the new technique is very versatile."
   "Two new classes of rational functions are presented which are realizable as impedance functions of Foster-type RLC networks. In one class, pairs of poles and zeros interlace on the negative real axis and in the second class, complex poles and zeros interlace on certains-plane paths."
 "There are several examples of infinite networks of resistors; it is always assumed that a unique current exists as a consequence of Kirchhoff's laws. Actually, unlike the situation in finite networks, these laws are insufficient to determine a unique current. A plausible set of network laws are formulated and two main theorems are proved. 1) In an infinite network consisting of nonnegative resistors (with no short circuits) and a finite number of sources, there exists a unique current flow. 2) This current flow is the limit of the unique current flows in finite, subnetworks that approximate the whole network. Methods of algebraic topology and Hilbert space theory are used in the formulations and proofs."
"We consider the uniform transmission line network that represents electromagnetic waves, with propagation constantsk(p)and characteristic impedancesZ(p)(pis the complex frequency variable), that are propagating in uniform homogeneous waveguides. A wave is said to be passive (active) if the net flow of electromagnetic energy associated with it is into (out of) the material through which the wave is propagating. On the other hand, a wave is stable if it does not grow, either spatially or temporally, as it propagates. It is shown that in order for a wave to be passive it is necessary thatk(p)be analytic,Z(p)be analytic and nonzero,[Re k(p)] \\{Re [1/Z(p)]\\} \\geq O, Z(p^{\\ast})=Z^{\\ast}(p), andk(p^{\\ast})=k^{\\ast}(p), all inRe p>O. In the special case whereZ(p)=p/k(p), we prove that the passivity conditions guarantee thatRe k(p)\\neq 0andRe [k(p)/p] \\neq OinRe p>O, which enables us to demonstrate that a passive wave is in fact stable, even though a stable wave may be active. We also develop an algebraic test to determine if any roots of a polynomial ink(the socalled dispersion equation) are propagation constants of active waves."
"The sensitivity of a passive impedance (admittance) to variations of its individual elements is discussed using Vratsanos' (Cohn's) theorem. The measure of the overall sensitivity which arises naturally is the sum of the magnitudes of the sensitivities to individual elements. For reciprocal realizations the sensitivity magnitude sums over resistances and reactances are separately related to the total power dissipation and the energy storage of the network. To minimize sensitivity, the energy storage must be minimized. Previous results for the energy storage of a one-port are used and extended to discuss further the minimum sensitivity problem. In certain cases it is shown how to find a synthesis having minimum sensitivity at all frequencies. The wider class of networks containing gyrators is also discussed, using an extension of Vratsanos' theorem. In this case the results obtained are weaker, since the properties of the actual realization, and that of the conjugate realization obtained by gyrator coupling reversals, are involved symmetrically. Bounds in terms of total power dissipations and energy storage are found for the sensitivity magnitude sums over resistances and reactances. The general results are illustrated by particular examples. It is shown by example that the sensitivity magnitude sum over resistances in a nonreciprocal network can be lower than the universal value imposed on reciprocal networks."
 "A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to a set of linear circuit equations with dependent sources is shown to be that a submatrix derived from the coefficients of dissipative elements has rank equal to the number of dissipative elements. This result is particularly useful in computer-aided circuit analysis to determine a cause when a numerical solution does not converge. In the development a general systematic technique for reducing circuit equations to normal form is presented. It is also demonstrated that when dependent sources are present, the order of a circuit is not necessarily equal to the number of independent energy-storing elements. The techniques and conclusions are illustrated with some simple nontrivial examples."
"The node determinant\\Sigma A_{k} \\Lambda^{k}of anLCRnetwork is given by the sum of the products of the element admittances of all the trees of the network. Some graph theoretical properties of the coefficients\\{A_{k}\\}are investigated where eachA_{k}is represented as a function of the element values. The main results include the theorem that any three successive coefficientsA_{k}, A_{k+1}, andA_{k+2}completely determine the network."
"Graphs consisting of a pair of distinct trees are considered. The minimal graphs in the class of such graphs are defined, and a few theorems concerning the minimal subgraphs contained in the original graphs are derived. The structure of the graphs in connection with the minimal graphs is considered."
"This paper presents an affirmative answer to the heretofore unresolved question as to whether an autonomous nonlinear system can always be synthesized to possess a finite number of prescribed singular points, as well as a prescribed set of eigenvalues associated with each singular point. The answer is given in the form of a new canonic nth-order nonlinear system containing(3n-2)single-valued functions. In the casen=2the canonic system is shown to possess many nice general properties which are useful for determining aspects of the system's global qualitative behavior, such as global stability."
  "The state-variable analysis of a class of rate distortionless frequency modulators is presented. A two-parameter design technique is developed to reduce the state coefficient matrix to a fundamental formulation which yields an orthogonal pure FM solution matrix and a scalar AM distortion factor."
 "The mathematical representation of the short-time spectral analysis is extended from the case of uniform bandpass filters (that is, filters having the same complex envelope) to the case of nonuniform filters (that is, filters whose complex envelope depends upon their center frequency). This leads to an integral transform, formally similar to the Fourier transform, where the signal taken up to the observation time appears weighted by a function (namely, the complex envelope) depending on the frequency of analysis. Of course, for every choice of such a complex envelope (or of the equivalent set of filters), one has a corresponding integral transform to deal with. The particular case of complex envelopes as functions of the time-frequency product is studied here because of its great physical interest (it applies, for instance, to many existing \"real-time audio analyzers\"). The corresponding integral transform is shown to have two remarkable properties: 1) it admits an inverse integral transform; 2) it is \"form invariant\" under linear time scaling of the signal, and no other integral transform (that is, no other class of complex envelopes, even frequency independent) shares this property. The physical significance of such results is discussed, together with some ideas for applications and further theoretical work."
  "This paper derives and discusses necessary conditions for an optimum in nonlinear minimax approximation problems. A straightforward geometrical interpretation is presented. The results may be used to test for convergence in computer-aided network optimization, in tests for optimality in the Chebyshev sense of any given design, and to gain insight which may be helpful in developing minimax approximation algorithms."
"This paper presents a general solution to the problem of synthesizing a passive two-port consisting of a cascade of uniform lossless transmission lines, commensurable or incommensurable, and lumped passive lossless two-ports in an arbitrary sequence with a resistive termination at the receiving end. After a basic discussion is given on the foundation of the multivariable synthesis of networks composed of uniform lossless transmission lines and lumped passive elements, the necessary and sufficient condition is given on the scattering function for it to be realizable as a cascade network. Based on this result, some special cases of the problem are discussed. Further, the equivalence of the multivariable and frequency-domain approaches to the above-mentioned problem is established."
"Some results are given in the formal theory of nonuniform transmission lines whose constitutive parameters are bounded measurable functions of the geometric abscissaxand holomorphic functions of the complex variablepin some regionDof the complex plane."
"In wide-band repeatered coaxial transmission systems, the dominant loss due to skin effect of the cable varies with temperature and cable length. Line-build-out (LBO) networks, whose attenuation characteristics match various amounts of cable losses, are inserted to yield a fixed loss characteristic between repeaters. A multipath structure is proposed as a new means of realizing adjustable LBO networks. Variation of the proposed structure is accomplished through electronically controlled variable gain amplifiers, allowing precise setting of the build-out. The transmission characteristics of the paths can be realized with either lumped circuit elements or distributed networks, as the frequency of interest might dictate. The amplifier gain variation performs an interpolation among the transfer functions of the different paths. The theoretical upper limit of the usable adjustment range is determined by the tolerance on the inaccuracies of the interpolation process. The two-path (II-path) configuration appears to be the easiest to realize, while providing enough adjustable range and accuracy to be of practical interest to both digital and analog wide-band repeatered systems. In the baseband PCM application, simulation shows that a 7-dB adjustable range, at the half pulse rate, is feasible with only 0.9-percent pulse distortion."
"A rotary energy converter is viewed as a dynamic coupled circuit. Its equation of motion is formulated as a state-vector differential equation with time-varying coefficients. A numerical method of solving the state equation with time-varying coefficients is then presented and an example is considered to illustrate the procedure."
 "WhenZ(s)has one triple pole and one triple zero, i.e.,Z(s)=(s+z)^{3}/(s+p)^{3}, a series-parallelRLCrealization can be obtained using an extended form of the Guillemin technique. This synthesis, which eliminates the need for surplus factors and avoids minimization, proves to be appropriate forZ(s)within its entire positive real range."
"Realization of a second-order nonminimum phase transfer function using the Fialkow-Gerst two-portRC-network synthesis and analysis of the general twin-TRCnetwork lead to the same design relations governing the element values. Sensitivity consideration shows the practical limitations on this circuit for a specificQof the zeros and for a bounded spread in element values."
"The effective bandwidth of a signal is defined. Restrictions on the effective bandwidth are obtained."
"A new potential function is derived for dissipative physical systems with ideal drivers. The Lagrangian thus formulated satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation, and the Hamiltonian thus derived satisfies the canonical-form Euler-Lagrange equation. State models can be obtained from a given system graph and vice versa if the state model is realizable."
"The effective bandwidth of a signal using anL^{2}norm is defined. Easily applied bounds on the effective bandwidth are determined."
"An alternate derivation of the dual condition (called the severance-value condition in this paper) to feasibility of the multicommodity flow problem is given by graph theoretical arguments. That is, a multicommodity flow of given requirements is feasible if and only if the capacity of every severance is no less than its least capacity consumption for the flow. A severance is a set of the edges with nonnegative integer coefficients. Even when the severance-value condition is satisfied by a certain finite subset of severances, the multicommodity flow is shown to be still feasible if each requirement is allowed to be reduced by an appropriate amount\\mu. This truncation allowance\\muis estimated in terms of the network topology and the capacity function."
"In the process of calculating the admittance matrix of a fairly largen-port network ofn+q+1nodes, we are often confronted with the problem of seeking that order of the pivotal condensations with respect toqinternal ports of the primitive admittance matrix. Motivated by this problem, we discuss a method of decomposing a given graph.into \"compactly connected\" two-terminal subgraphs. The decomposition enables us to apply the block-pivoted condensation on the nodal admittance matrix."
"Invariance properties of central trees are investigated with respect to four operations: deleting, adding, contracting, and inserting. The results obtained seem to be useful for theoretical and practical purposes such as investigating topological properties of reduced or extended graphs and finding central trees of large graphs."
"The stability of equilibrium points of autonomous nonlinear networks with parasitics is presented. Conditions are given under which the behavior of the parasitic network is approximated by the simplified network without parasitics. More precisely, criteria are provided for which, if the parasitics are sufficiently small, the stability (instability) of the simplified network implies the stability (instability) of the network with parasitics."
"In a recent paper Chua proved that a large class of voltage-controlled nonlinear resistiven-ports could be realized with the aid of a homeomorphic resistiven-port and a linear transformation converter (LTC) constructed of2nnegative linear resistors. He conjectured that onlynsuch resistors are needed. In addition to proving this conjecture, we demonstrate that thenresistors need not be negative."
"Achieser-Zolotarev filters are similar to the familiar Chebyshev low-pass filters except for a large-amplitude first ripple (near dc). If a low-pass filter is required for operation only over the upper frequency portion of the band, an Achieser-Zolotarev filter may be used to give greater attenuation in the stopband for a given ripple level. The new filters give increased flexibility in the choice of impedance level within the filter, leading to improved design for distributed-element filters. The design tables for filters of 5, 7, 9, and 11 elements include the coefficients of the Zolotarev polynomials, the comparative stopband attenuation relative to the Chebyshev case, and the element values of lumped-element quasi-low-pass filters for various pass bandwidths and ripple levels of 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 dB."
"A backward algorithm of Lin and Tokad is described and its application to equivalent low-passLCladder networks is illustrated. Also a relation is established which eliminates the necessity of applying the Lin and Tokad algorithm twice to obtain all the element values of the ladder network."
"A method of synthesizing a crystal band-reject filter by transforming anRLClow-pass prototype is described. The various transformations involved utilize the constant-reactance concept. To illustrate, a seventh-order Cauer parameter low-pass prototype is used."
"This correspondence shows quantitatively why the narrowband low-pass to band-pass frequency transformation has such surprisingly good delay-preserving properties for wide bandwidths. Also presented are easily computed approximations to the low-pass delay at high frequencies and to the relative delay error at band center due to the transformation."
 "This correspondence describes three results concerning the natural frequencies of transmission lines. It is shown that 1) a transmission line can be terminated in an admittance whose real part is negative in the entire right half of thesplane-yet no natural frequency is in the right half of thesplane; 2) for capacitive termination and simple gain feedback less than unity, all natural frequencies are purely imaginary; 3) for capacitive termination and simple feedback gain greater than unity, exactly two of the natural frequencies are real, one being positive, the other negative. The utility of these results in stability analysis is shown."
"This correspondence describes a computer-aided design technique for designing an active distributedRCnetwork with an impulse response thai is closest to a specified time function inL_{2}space. The Ghausi-Bello procedure is used to derive the network structure and initial parameter values. For optimization the gradient is computed by the adjoint network method after being extended to include distributed parameters."
"A two-dimensional analysis of BesselRClines is numerically carried out by using a successive over-relaxation method, and the results are compared with characteristics conventionally obtained by one-dimensional analysis."
"If a functionh(t)is approximated by the firstNterms of the set of Laguerre functionsI_{n}(pt), then the minimum integral-square error isI_{N}(p) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h^{2}(t)dt - \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_{n}^{2}(p)in whichc_{n}(p)are the coefficients of the Laguerre expansion ofh(t)andpis a scale factor by which the Laguerre functions can be stretched or compressed. The errorI_{N}(p)can be minimized further by an optimum choice ofp. Generally, it is not simple to determine the optimum scale factorp_{N}by analytical methods. In this paper an analytical method based on the power series equivalence of the Laguerre series is presented for determining the asymptotic optimum scale factorp_{\\infty} = n \\stackrel{\\lim}{\\rightarrow} \\infty p_{n}. The method is illustrated by determiningp_{\\infty}for some classes of functions of importance in system and signal theory. In engineering applications the number of terms used often is sufficiently large so that the asymptotic optimum scale factorp_{\\infty}can be expected to be a good approximation to the optimum scale factorp_{N}."
 "Group theory is used to analyze arbitrary network symmetries and is incorporated into a time-domain analysis scheme. Basis-function solutions are cataloged according to symmetry type, and inputs are constructed which excite only those solutions displaying a specific symmetry characteristic."
    "A completely topological algorithm for determining a minimal essential set (minimum feedback vertex set) of a linear oriented graph is presented. From a logical point of view, the algorithm is a modified version of the well-known McCluskey method for the prime implicant problem of switching theory. From a computational point of view, it avoids the need of the covering table, i.e., the need of generating the set of the elementary circuits of the graph."
 "Tables of essential complementary partitions of a setS_{k}are presented fork = 2, 3, 4, 5wherekis the number of elements ofS_{k}. They are sufficient for most practical applications."
"A unified short-cut tool for the analysis of both network and sensitivity functions of a ladder network is given. New results on the sensitivity analysis provide a simple useful method for laboratory measurements."
"This paper deals with nonlinear networks which can be characterized by the equationf(x) = y, wheref(\\cdot)maps the real Euclideann-spaceR^{n}into itself and is assumed to be continuously differentiablexis a point inR^{n}and represents a set of chosen network variables, andyis an arbitrary point inR^{n}and represents the input to the network. The authors derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution of the equation for ally \\in R^{n}in terms of the Jacobian matrix\\partial f/ \\partial x. It is shown that if a set of cofactors of the Jacobian matrix satisfies a \"ratio condition,\" the network has a unique solution. The class of matrices under consideration is a generalization of the classPrecently introduced by Fiedler and Pták, and it includes the familiar uniformly positive-definite matrix as a special case."
"A new two-terminal circuit element-called the memristorcharacterized by a relationship between the chargeq(t)\\equiv \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} i(\\tau) d \\tauand the flux-linkage\\varphi(t)\\equiv \\int_{- \\infty}^{t} v(\\tau) d \\tauis introduced as the fourth basic circuit element. An electromagnetic field interpretation of this relationship in terms of a quasi-static expansion of Maxwell's equations is presented. Many circuit-theoretic properties of memistors are derived. It is shown that this element exhibits some peculiar behavior different from that exhibited by resistors, inductors, or capacitors. These properties lead to a number of unique applications which cannot be realized withRLCnetworks alone. Although a physical memristor device without internal power supply has not yet been discovered, operational laboratory models have been built with the help of active circuits. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the properties and potential applications of memristors."
"This paper considers several of the problems caused by the presence of small parasitic capacitances and inductances in nonlinear network models. It first gives the condition for which the behavior of a network model can be approximated by the behavior of a simplified model recently with the parasitics removed. The condition is that the resistive subnetwork viewed from the terminals of the parasitics be strictly locally passive for a certain set of currents and voltages. This condition is independent of the relative magnitudes of the parasitics. The paper then considers networks whose equations cannot be put into normal form without the addition of a parasitic. In the case where two different choices of parasitics enable the network equations to be put into normal form, it gives conditions on the resistive subnetwork which ensure that the behavior of the two resulting networks is the same. It then exhibits a class of networks such that the networks resulting from the addition of any choice of parasitic which enables the network equations to be put into normal form have the same behavior. Finally, the paper shows how the behavior of this class of networks can be determined without the addition of parasitics. It formulates an inertia postulate and an explicit jump postulate to enable the multivalued normal form equations to be solved unambiguously."
"A filter design method which takes into account the filter's behavior during its transient period, rather than being based on steadystate frequency response, is proposed. The performance of the filter is expressed as a function of its response to sinusoids of varying frequency but fixed duration, thus leading to a treatment of the problem by the methods of optimal control theory. It is shown that if the magnitude of the filter impulse response is required to be bounded, then the magnitude of the optimal impulse response assumes the bound at all times, independent of the particular performance criterion used."
"The purpose of this special issue is to focus attention on current research and practice in two important and exciting areas of interest to the readers of this TRANSACTIONS. We are very much indebted to the Guest Associate Editors, S.K. Mitra (active) and J.F. Kaiser (digital), who were responsible for the reviews of the manuscripts. Active networks, and in particular active RC networks, have been studied for some time, and many basic and useful results have been obtained and continue to be obtained. The digital-filtering area warrants our serious attention not only because it is now economically feasible to consider the associated special-purpose computertype implementations, but also because it has given rise to many interesting and fundamental problems of a type not ordinarily encountered by the network theoretician."
"The general oscillator theory pertinent to frequency stability is presented, and the superiority of the bridge oscillator is demonstrated. The tables provided show the similarity between the transfer functions, and certain other network functions, of the commonly usedRCoscillator networks. These networks are optimized for use in frequency stable oscillators, and some very simple constraints are found for the parallel-Tnetwork. Contrary to the ideas of previous authors the best network for anRCoscillator cannot be established theoretically. Instead, it is shown that the seven networks given fall into only three groups. Together these groups provide a continuous range of the two major properties required for good frequency stability. These properties must be chosen empirically to match the amplifier used in a particular oscillator."
"Some theorems concerning positive or negative inverters and converters (generalized gyrators and transformers) are stated. These theorems give general methods of transforming a given inverter (or converter) into other inverters or converters. In particular, all possible terminal voltage-current relations of a basic 4-port, which underlies most realizations of inverters and converters, are determined. These results have implications for the practical realization of integrated inverters and converters."
"A completely general active RC network synthesis technique using a grounded gyrator and a summing amplifier is described. The technique overcomes serious limitations of previous RC-gyrator realizations and offers advantages over other general active RC synthesis methods. The technique is well suited for construction using thin-film RC networks and integrated circuit operational amplifiers, and provides a configuration which is quite Insensitive to element variations."
"A general and exact analysis is presented for a class of selfoscillating dc-to-dc converters which can be modeled by a single-loop nonlinear feedback system. The nonlinearity is assumed to be a hysteresis characteristic; however, it is not required to have odd symmetry. A set of equations is obtained which govern the switching frequency, duty cycle, dc error, and peak-to-peak ripple. Based on these equations, it is possible to predict the general performance and inherent limitations of various circuit configurations. An optimal design procedure for these circuits with respect to a quadratic performance index is suggested. Measured data from several voltage-regulator circuits verify the model chosen and its analysis."
  "It is shown that all canonical second-order activeRCfilters are equivalent to either gyratorRCor negative immittance converter (NIC)RCfilters, the equivalence being with respect to the capacitances. These two classes have basically different behavior. Comparisons within each class which are not confined to the detailed realization of the lossy gyrator or the lossy NIC (including the signal coupling into and out of the filter) are thus beside the point."
"The properties of a thick-film hybrid gyrator are shown by experimental results and are verified by calculation. The relatively small size of this gyrator is due to a transistor circuit without resistors. Two resistors determining the gyration constants have to be connected externally. Dynamic range, dc power consumption, andQenhancement can be adjusted by one or two further resistors. Those features give the user great design flexibility and show the way for future monolithic integration. LowfrequencyQwithout enhancement is 100 and more, power consumption is as low as 5 mW, and the frequency range is up to 100 kHz."
"A newN-path filter is proposed that uses only one single gyrator. This structure allows the realzalion of a double-tuned bandpass characteristic."
"A synthesis procedure is presented which proves the following theorem: For the realization of on arbitrary N X N matrix of real rational functions in the complex variable as a voltage transfer matrix of a transformerless grounded active RC 2N-port network, it is sufficient that the network contains 2N single-ended operational amplifiers embedded in an RC network."
"In conjunction with the capacitor, the differential voltage controlled current source (DVCCS) is shown to yield in a relatively simple manner and in integrated form all components needed for linear circuit construction. The effects of dissipative losses in the DVCCS are tabulated for several configurations. Finally, a new building block having two outputs is introduced."
  "A synthesis procedure, easily implemented as a digital computer program, is presented whereby anyp \\times pmatrixY(s)of real rational functions of the complex frequency variablescan be realized as the short-circuit admittance matrix of ap-port activeRCnetwork. The realization requires a minimum number of capacitors-n =degree\\{Y(s)\\}-and no more than2(p+n)inverting common ground voltage-controlled voltage sources. All the capacitors and ports are grounded."
"A new statistical multiparameter measure of sensitivity is presented. The new measure realistically accounts for component tolerances and component tolerance correlations and is shown to be particularly useful in the design of integrated circuits. For illustration the measure is used to analyze several high-Qlow-sensitivity networks. It is shown that for high-Qnetworks the new measure is readily interpreted in terms of theQand center frequency sensitivities of the circuit elements. The measure is also generalized for high-Qanalysis to account for the error in realization due to the ampliler pole as well as the element variations. This enables an evaluation of the circuit response versus center frequency to be performed."
"Pole-polynomial decomposition forms the basis for classifying activeRCfilters into ten groups. This classification serves two purposes. First, the gain and sensitivity properties are directly related to the type of decomposition. Thus the optimum gain and sensitivity values for any filter structure can be easily determined by simply finding the classification to which the filter belongs. Second, active filters have been developed for two new types of polynomial decomposition for which no active filters previously existed. These new circuits have very good gain-sensitivity properties."
"What's a diamond to an ape, do you think? It's nothing to be eaten by a monkey. --- Thai poem The philosophy is advanced of having two programs to cover a given area, one for quick routine calculations and one to handle general cases Thus, two scattering matrix programs are described for the area of computer-aided analysis of active circuits. Both programs rest upon an iterative use of cascade loading, a connection previously proven to incorporate any arbitrary connection. One program, GENERAL, covers the multiport case and through an incorporation of the generality of the scattering matrix handles any physical network. GENERAL proceeds by finding the scattering matrix of interconnections through the use of the indefinite admittance and by iteratively cascade loading such interconnections with componenets. The other (time-shared) program, SPEEDY, is a fast 2-port version. SPEEDY's time advantage comes about by programming the specific results for the most typical design connections (to which the program is limited). These are the series-parallel and cascade connections for 2-ports interpreted in terms of scattering parameters. SPEEDY contains two unique subroutines: one for all possible 2-port connections and one for converting common emitter scattering parameters to those for common base or collector."
"We consider the dc equations of nonlinear networks containing resistors, independent voltage sources (independent current sources are excluded), and certain types of nonlinear devices (such as Ebers-Mollmodeled transistors and diodes) that possess a certain property closely related to passivity. It is proved for the first time that the equations always possess at least one solution. This result complements some of the writers' previous work in which attention was not focused on networks containing only independent sources of the voltage type. In fact it was shown by simple examples given earlier that there exist transistor networks (containing ideal independent current sources) for which the network equations have no solution. Here we also complete a study of conditions under which it is possible to carry out certain implicit numerical integration algorithms for the computation of the transient response of an important class of nonlinear networks containing transistors and diodes. We in fact prove that the assumption of passivity for the transistors and diodes implies that it is always possible to carry out the algorithms (in the sense that for any value of the step size there is always at least one solution of a certain key set of nonlinear equations)."
"A synthesis procedure for any all-pole transfer function with strictly positive coefficients is presented. The procedure utilizes anRCladder with an ideal unity gain amplifier."
"The pole sensitivity with reference to the open-loop gainbandwidth product|\\omega_{a}|of the amplifier for a large class of single-voltage amplifierRCnetworks is examined. Both finite gain and operational amplifier networks are considered under the assumption that the amplifier openloop gain effectively has a one-pole rolloff frequency characteristic. Forp=\\omega_{0}(-1/2Q+j\\sqrt{1-1/4Q^{2}})a nominal pole of the transfer function, general expressions fordp/d(1/ \\omega_{a}), dQ/d(1/ \\omega_{a}), andd \\omega_{0}/d(1 / \\omega_{a})are presented in terms of certain parameters of theRCnetwork. It is shown that these parameters may generally be found by inspection from theRCopenand short-circuit time constants and the high-frequency current gain of the passiveRCnetwork. The second-order transfer function case is considered in detail and the optimum choices of the pertinent passiveRCnetwork parameters for minimum sensitivity magnitude under various constraints are presented. A simple expression for the minimum possible magnitude ofdp / d(1 / \\omega_{a})for a given second-order transfer function is derived. Finally, the application of these criteria to existing synthesis schemes in order to minimizedp/d(1/ \\omega_{a})or achieve other sensitivity properties, such as zeroQsensitivity, is discussed."
"A computationally efficient algorithm for analysis of general linear time-invariant systems is described. The algorithm formulates state equations which are subsequently analyzed by transforming the system into an equivalent one having theAmatrix in the Frobenius canonical form. This approach was found to be significantly more efficient than other methods currently in use. The program was used for optimization and an example is presented."
"Realization of arbitrary transfer functions by a special class of multiple-loop feedback configuration is investigated. Thenth-order system consists ofnnominally identical single-pole active stages with arbitrary but constant interconnections. The constraints on the sensitivity functions with respect to the active stages of such a system are obtained. is shown that the effect of identical perturbations of the gains of active stages, such as those which may be expected due to environmental variations, is invariant for a given transfer function, and hence can be accurately predicted. Subject to these constraints, conditions are derived for the minimum of a suitably defined multiparameter sensitivity index, which may then be used to minimize the effect of mutually independent random perturbations of the gains, such as those expected due to manufacturing tolerances. For second-order systems, the optimal design is obtained analytically. For higher order systems, a general optimization scheme, employing steepest descent from an initial design, is outlined. The optimal design of a fourth-order stagger-tuned bandpass filter is presented as an illustration."
"A well-known limitation of the recursive digital filter, when compared to the nonrecursive filter, is its incapability of having a strictly linear phase characteristic; thus it may only approximate a constant group delay. For the analog filters the choice of the maximally flat criterion leads to the use of the Bessel polynomials. Yet digital approximations of these continuous filter functions are inadequate to yield the true maximally flat delay approximation of the recursive filters. Our purpose is to provide for the problem at hand a solution obtained by a direct approximation procedure in thezplane. The denominator of the transfer function turns out to be a Gaussian hypergeometric function, more particularly connected with the Legendre functions. The stability of the filters is discussed and some numerical results in regard to the amplitude and phase responses as well as the pole loci are given."
"All-pole recursive digital low-pass filters approximating a constant group delay in an equal-ripple sense are described. The equalripple conditions are given by a system of nonlinear equations in the poles of the transfer function. The closed-form solution obtained for a particular value of the cutoff frequency yields good first approximations for the iterative procedure required in the general case. The set of approximated delays and ripples leading to realizable filters is discussed. Numerical examples illustrating the procedure are included."
"The accuracy of a digital filter is limited by the finite word length used in its implementation. Techniques have been developed to analyze this problem. Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results has been reported. This paper discusses some of these accuracy problems and reviews some of the approaches used in investigating them. The calculation of the statistical mean-squared error at the output of the filter is discussed in detail."
"The error accumulation in a digital filter employing floatingpoint arithmetic is studied. Sources of errors are considered to originate from 1) roundoff in the arithmetic operations, 2) quantization of both the input and the initial states, and 3) effects of coefficient inaccuracies. Existing methods of analysis for the case of deterministic input (case A) and the case of stochastic input (case B) are reviewed and presented in the context of the canonical realization of a digital filter. A unified treatment of all these sources of errors is indicated, and results complementary to the existing results on the direct realization are thus obtained. A comparison is made of the roundoff error accumulation of the canonical realization with that of the direct realization, with the general conclusion that both realizations of any filter exhibit the same roundoff error distortion for any arbitrary wide-sense-stationary stochastic input."
"A deterministic analysis of limit-cycle oscillations, which occur in fixed-point implementations of recursive digital filters due to roundoff and truncation quantization after multiplication, is performed. Amplitude bounds, based upon a correlated (nonstochastic) signal approach using Lyapunov's direct method, as well as a general matrix formulation for zero-input limit cycles, are derived and tested for the two-pole filter. The limit cycles are represented on a successive-value phase-plane-type diagram from which certain symmetry properties are derived. The results are extended to include limit cycles under input-signal conditions."
"A theory for implementation of recursive digital filters that process signals by blocks is presented. It is shown that this approach provides a very general family of filters that includes both the conventional scalar implementation and batch processing. The approach is based on a matrix representation of convolution and results in a state-variable description with block feedback. An eigenvalue analysis guarantees stability of the realization and indicates a reduction in sensitivity to roundoff and coefficient accuracy."
"In keeping with the trend toward greater use of digital circuits for signal processing, a project was undertaken to realize an important telecommunication function using as great a proportion of digital hardware as possible. The function in question concerns the translation between the traditional analog frequency division multiplex (FDM) format and the newer digital time division multiplex (TDM) format. This paper describes the design of the digital filters for such a translating device and discusses some of the problems encountered in the hardware realization of these filters. In particular, a concise relationship is developed between the amount of digital filter hardware required and the sample rate, clock (bit) rate, data word length, number of channels being multiplexed, and order of the filter. This relationship is then used as the basis of comparison between various methods of accomplishing the desired function."
"A now approach is presented for obtaining a linear timevarying recursive digital filter which will optimally simulate the behavior of a linear time-varying analog filter. The property of the best approximation of linear functionals by means of generalized spline functions is invoked in the derivation of the results. In this approach, the optimal digital simulator is, viewed as a min-max estimator of the samples of the analog filter output based on the samples of its input. These samples are not required to appear at uniformly spaced instants of time. The assumption is made that the analog filter input belongs to a class\\Omega_{a}of signals, each member of\\Omega_{a}being generated by a known differential dynamical system\\Lambdaforced by some input whose energy is less than or equal to a constant\\alpha^{2}. By interpolating the samples of the analog filter input by a generalized spline associated with the differential operator pertaining to the system\\Lambda, the structure of the optimal digital simulator is derived. Error bounds are derived as functions of the maximum sampling subinterval length and the theory is illustrated by means of examples."
"It is shown that most of the techniques for analog filter design presented by Watanabe [7] and others who have specialized or extended Watanabe's work are applicable, without the usual restrictions (due to undesirablility of mutual coupling, for example), to digital filter approximation problems when the bilinear transformation is employed."
 "In a previous paper this writer postulated an ideal topological transmission element (unitor) and has shown in subsequent papers its conceptual value over the entire field of nonreciprocal network analysis and synthesis. Later writers have employed the nullor, which, in its threeterminal form, is externally equivalent to the unitor. Now that wide-band linear differential-input operational amplifier units are readily available in compact solid-state form, It has become practicable to obtain convenient and useful realizations of the unitor (or nullor). In this paper we give the basic circuit technique."
 "The output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a frequency doubler is calculated using the transform method for nonlinear systems with stochastic inputs. The class of nonlinearities considered is the evenVth-power-law devices. It is found that the squarer (V = 2) is optimum at low SNR, while for high SNR,V rightarrow 0is best. Choice of the bandpass filters in the system is also considered."
"Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
"It is noted that the essential results published by Mazo and Salz were previously disclosed and obtained using simple and direct Fourier transform computer techniques. When comparing the rms bandwidth of this system with the analogous double-sideband spectrum on the basis of equal modulating signal strength in the two systems, the bandwidth crossover point is actually lower than the value stated by Mazo and Salz. However, when comparing the two systems on the basis of equal relative sideband power, the bandwidth of SSB angle modulation is always less than conventional angle modulation."
"A new method for determining the number of spikes per second, and hence the threshold carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), of the phase-locked-loop demodulator is presented. This technique can also be applied to the frequency demodulator with feedback. This method is applicable when nonwhite noise is present at the input of the demodulator and also when the carrier is frequency modulated. Computer processing is employed so that rapid comparisons of the phase-locked-loop (PLL) systems can be made. The results show the spikes per second and the threshold CNR, without modulation, for the first-, second-, and third-order PLL and FM discriminator. Experimental results are then presented."

"Theoretical and practical results in the field of digital filtering encourage the examination of digital filters for use in multiplex communication systems [1]-[3]. Although their economic breaking in will only come in combination with large-scale integration of digital circuits, it appears worthwhile to study their feasibility for various applications [4]-[7], [9]. One application of particular interest is the digital realization of single-sideband frequency-division multiplexing (SSB/FDM), which leads to the study of the digital realization of the SSB-channel bank which is internationally known as the first multiplexed group in the frequency range of 60-108 kHz. This paper describes the conversion of voice-frequency channels into SSB/FDM signals using digital filters. A brief analysis explains the implications of the various steps of signal processing in the time and frequency domains. The digital realization of a channel bank is explained in block diagrams. It is shown that the SSB/FDM signal appears simultaneously as a TDM/SSB signal (TDM/FDM/SSB)."
"A survey is described in which a random sample of 1000 telephones was drawn from a universe of 5.7 million General System main telephones in the United States and Canada. Survey data relating to the sample telephones, the serving central offices, and the transmission media between offices and telephones were computer processed to develop estimates of the General System's plant composition, costs, subscriber distribution, and the expected growth pattern during the next decade. The results provide a data base for engineering studies of new plant designs and for more accurate estimates of the influence of possible service offerings."
"A method previously presented by the authors for the evaluation of error probabilities in digital systems when impulsive noise is the main cause of incorrect decisions is here applied to differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) modems. Specifically, the receiver impulsive characteristic, which is proportional to the error rate, is evaluated for binary DPSK systems both in the linear and hard-limited modes of operation. Two encoding systems are considered, in-phase encoding and quadrature encoding, and it is shown that they yield essentially the same performance, at least when the binary symbols are equally likely. The results are compared with the performance of phase-shift keying (PSK) and it is found that, in the presence of impulsive noise, DPSK systems have, for the same SNR, an error rate which is nearly twice the error rate obtained for PSK. However, the dependence of error rate on SNR is generally a slowly decreasing function so that a considerable improvement in SNR is required to improve performance."
"The feasibility of coding two-dimensional data arrays by first performing a two-dimensional linear transformation on the data and then block quantizing the transformed data is investigated. The Fourier, Hadamard, and Karhunen-Loève transformations are considered. Theoretical results for Markov data and experimental results for four pictures comparing these transform methods to the standard method of raster scanning, sampling, and pulse-count modulation code are presented."
"RcompversusE_{b} / N_{0}is calculated for a coherent white Gaussian noise channel and biorthogonal signal sets with quantized and continuous correlator outputs. The results are compared with list ofLdetection and it is observed that the quantized scheme is more efficient. Curves ofE_{b} / N_{0}for code rateR = R_{comp}versus1/Rare presented so that the efficiency of convolutional encoding and sequential decoding with various other modems can be compared for fixed rate codes."
"In this paper a simple coding scheme utilizing both sequential and algebraic coding is proposed, and bounds on its performance are derived using theoretical bounds on the performance of sequential decoding. These bounds are compared with bounds on a similar, though more complex, scheme proposed by Falconer [2]. Except for sequential rates in a range strictly aboveR_{comp},the bounds on the present scheme are shown to be superior."
"The results of Kramer and Viterbi m postdecision feedback problems are extended for the case when the phases of the binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals transmitted are not known. A suboptimum scheme for the receiver is suggested that is found to allow better performance characteristics than an optimum coherent receiver operating without postdecision feedback."
"Where a frequency-shift keying (FSK)keyer generating a spectrum that is broad compared to that required for the information is used, considerable spectrum economy can often be obtained by passing the signal through a properly selected symmetrical bandpass filter. The signal can then be passed through a hard limiter which regenerates some of the sidebands filtered off, but not nearly all of them. This limiter renders the signal suitable for amplification by classC, switching type, or other high-efficiency amplifiers. For low indices of modulation, an approximation can be made of the effect of a filter by assuming that the modulation signal is filtered by the low pass analogy of the bandpass filter, and that each component of the modulating wave modulates the carrier independently."
"The existence of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for goodness of fit to a Rayleigh distribution is shown. The test does not require that the variance of the hypothesized distribution be known."
"In practice, the measurement of the covariance function (which characterizes a time- and frequency-selective fading communication channel) involves envelope detecting the received signals before correlating. Envelope covariance is insufficient for an accurate evaluation of system performance and rather a complex covariance is needed. In this paper the relationship between complex covariance and envelope covariance for a Rician fading communication channel is derived. It includes the well-known case of Rayleigh fading. For the assumption of the symmetric power spectrum of the narrow-band random process there exists a monotonic relationship which allows the evaluation of the complex covariance once the envelope covariance is measured. The derived equation for the unsymmetric power spectrum is discussed. The results obtained show that the envelope covariance represents a lower bound of the magnitude of the complex covariance."
"The general features of the 10-C toll and transit switching system have been briefly described in two earlier publications [1], [2]. More detailed information on the switching matrix configurations and interconnecting arrangements used in this system and on the calculation and simulation methods employed to ascertain its traffic load handling performance is provided."
"Measurements of the statistical characteristics of a proposed HF channel are usually required before such a channel is designed. These measurements require an elaborate test setup with test transmitters at the proposed transmitting sites. This work is therefore both time consuming and expensive, particularly when alternative locations are considered. This paper describes a method which allows the signals radiated from an AM transmitter to be used for determination of the frequency correlation function for the channel. The method is based on the fact that the frequency functions of the upper sideband (USB) and lower sideband (LSB) of an AM signal are complex conjugates. The received signal is filtered into its USB, carrier, and LSB components. The USB and LSB signals are synchronously demodulated. Since the two signals are transmitted on different frequencies, they can be used for frequency correlation determinations. The modulating signal can, in most cases, be considered as random noise. Its effects are removed by normalization."
"The phase-error variance of a phase-locked loop is dependent on the stability of its voltage-control oscillator and that of the source oscillator being tracked. Statistics relative to oscillator stability are commonly gathered by counted-frequency techniques and are so specified in manufacturers' data. In order thus to predict the performance of a loop using such an oscillator, it is necessary to know how to relate counter data to loop error. This paper presents such a method based on a simple but realistic model of oscillator noises and shows that the mean sample variance of the counted-frequency method converges rather curiously and slowly to the actual variance. The model for the flicker component of the noise is physically realistic (finite power) and allows one to find the range of validity for the usual formal calculations for the sample variance of the counted frequency. In addition, insight is gained into the relation between the sample variance and the actual finite variance of the realistic model. The effect of oscillator instability on a first-order loop is longterm steady-state phase-error drift and short-term zero-mean fluctuation about this steady state. For the second-order loop, the steady-state drift disappears."
"Many applications of the bandpass limiter (BPL) involve coherent demodulation following the limiter. It is shown that as a result of demodulation, the signal mean and the noise variance are direct functions of the phase angle between the signal component passed by the BPL and the coherent reference. As a result, the relationship between the output and input signal-to-noise ratio may be significantly different than that obtained by Davenport for incoherent limiters. A study is also made of the output noise spectral density, and an approximate expressison is derived as a function of the input signal-to-noise ratio, reference phase angle, and the characteristics of the input bandpass filter to the limiter. Also discussed is the first-order signal-plus-noise probability density following coherent demodulation."
"In this concise paper we sketch the derivation of a rigorous (and tight) upper bound on the probability of error in a binary pulse-code modulation (PCM) twin channel optical receiver in the absence of thermal noise. This result is valid for any binary system, described by Poisson statistics in each of its states, in which the binary decision is based on which state has the larger count. Examples of such systems include polarization modulation, binary pulse position modulation, frequency-shift keying with separate detectors, and differentially-coherent phase-shift keying."

"The following classical problem is solved and the results are applied to minimize the mean-square error ε of communication and data compression systems: \"a stationary random input signalx(t)is prefiltered, corrupted by noisen(t), sampled everyTseconds, and finally postfiltered to yield output\\hat{x}(t). Let the desired outputz(t) = a(t) \\bigotimes x(t)wherea(t)is any real function oftand\\bigotimesdenotes convolution.

OperatorE{\\dot}denotes expected value,k(t)is a real function oft, andf(t)is the prefilter impulse response. Appropriate choice ofT,P,k(t), andn(t)makes the solution applicable to amplitude, angle, pulse-amplitude (PAM), pulse-code (PCM), and differential pulsecode (DPCM) modulation systems, and data compression systems. In this analysis no restrictions are placed on the input-signal spectrum, the noise spectrum, or the passbands of the filters; furthermore, the cross correlation between signal and noise is taken into consideration. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the jointly optimum pre- and postfilters. The performance obtainable using these optimum filters is compared with that obtainable using suboptimum filters. One suboptimum filtering scheme is derived which yields virtually the same performance as optimum filters and has the practical advantage that the filter transfer characteristics are independent of noisen(t)in many cases of interest. In applying the results to PCM, DPCM, and data compression systems, the filters, sampling rate, and quantizer are jointly optimized. The performance obtainable for various filtering schemes and various communication systems is compared with the optimum attainable as calculated from information theory."
"Subscriber carrier has played an important role in serving sparsely settled rural areas where it was not economical or technically feasible to use voice frequency circuits. For increased usage of carrier in subscriber plant the 1964 Rural Electrification Administration (REA) loop survey [1] showed that several new innovations were needed. Using the loop survey information as a foundation, REA established objectives for a carrier system [2] that could serve much of today's subscriber service needs. This equipment has come to be known as station carrier and is available from seven manufacturers in two major categories. The multichannel systems (four or more channels per system) especially fit the needs of rural telephony, and the single-channel systems are used in both urban and rural systems. The first station carrier was placed in service in an REA-financed telephone system during the summer of 1965. Following this and other successful field trials, the telephone industry has witnessed steady growth in its use. There are tens of thousands of channels in use today in the United States and abroad. The successful operation and rapid growth of station carrier may prove to be the gateway to an all-electronic means of subscriber service. This paper outlines the design objectives of station carrier and discusses how these objectives have been met. The authors also give their evaluation of station carrier performance as observed at several REA-financed telephone companies."
"A digital time-domain method to calculate interchannel distortion of linearly filtered angle-modulated signals is described. The method can handle cases when a transmission medium produces large multipleechoes, or its frequency-domain characteristics can be approximated by a finite set of sinusoidal functions. Sums of sets of equally spaced sinusoids with random phases are used to simulate the baseband. Distortion is obtained by averaging the results of successive Monte Carlo trials."
"The difficulties encountered by acoustically coupled 103 compatible data sets are considered. In particular the limitations introduced by the harmonic distortion generated by the nonlinearity of the telephone's microphone are analyzed. It is shown that interference between the second harmonic of the transmitted signal and the received signal restricts the application of acoustic coupling to lines of relatively low attenuation. A method of cancelling the second harmonic by adding a third harmonic component to the transmitted signal is described, and shown to be independent of the microphone's nonlinearities. The effect of handset placement on the microphone's performance is also analyzed and experimental results are given. Incorporating the described method of reducing second harmonic distortion and choosing the optimal handset placement allow Applied Digital Data Systems acoustic coupler to transmit at full power and to communicate reliably in full duplex on lines of up to 30-dB attenuation."
"The error rate or the probability of error is an important parameter in the design of digital communication systems. In this paper a Gram-Charlier expansion is used to compute the error rate in the presence of intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise. The method presented is very useful for numerical computations. We also present expressions for the truncation errors. Rigorous proofs are presented in the Appendix."
"A formal series expansion is given for the powerdensity spectrum of a carrier frequency-modulated by a random signal. The first term of the series is the well-known Woodward term usually obtained heuristically by considering the FM wave as a slowly changing sinusoid. Higher order terms represent corrections to this quasi-static description."
"An innovation which improves the capability and performance of certain types of phase-coherent demodulators is introduced. This innovation has application in the fields of telemetry and tracking, e.g., relay satellite systems, deep-space communications, and military communication systems. The basic idea of the innovation centers around using the power in the composite signal sidebands to enhance the demodulator's effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The vehicle through which this is accomplished employs the principle of decision-directed feedback. In its simplest form it is shown, for the first-order loop, that the maximum improvement in loop SNR relative to a standard phase-locked loop is 10 dB. The paper explores and illustrates the corresponding improvement realized in detection system efficiency. Extension to higher order loops follows directly from the analysis given here."
"In recent years there has been considerable interest in time-division multiple access (TDMA) for communications via satellites. TDMA is free of intermodulation effects, since only one station signal is present in the satellite at a given time. The principal problem which had to be solved for TDMA was that of establishing and maintaining time synchronization between the participating earth stations in the communications network. In a joint communication experiment a new TDMA/pulse-code modulation (TDMA/PCM) system was built in Japan and installed at the Applications Technology Satellites (ATS) stations. The features of the system are 1) that time synchronization is established with a continuous low-level pseudonoise (PN) sequence so that the interference to other stations is negligible and knowledge of satellite range is not required and 2) that the participating earth stations have clock control loops which maintain bit and frame coherency referred to the satellite, that is, the bits as they arrive at the satellite are coherent from one station burst to the next station burst. Some of the results of extensive communication tests through the ATS are discussed."
"Static phase error offsets occur in first-order and passive second-order phase-locked loops, whenever the rest frequency of the local oscillator and the carrier are different prior to acquisition. The effect of the offset is to degrade performance and in particular to decrease the mean time to first slip. This paper studies first slip times via computer simulation. The mean time to first slip is displayed graphically as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for various static phase error offsets and values of the damping parameter."
"In this correspondence a general expression for carrier power suppression caused by angle modulation by a stationary stochastic process is examined. The result lends insight to the carrier suppression problem, and indicates procedures for determining suppression due to somewhat complicated modulation waveforms. Some extensions of previously known results concerning carrier suppression associated with transponding telemetry systems are presented."
"Several new techniques for designing finite-duration impulse-response digital filters have become available in the past few years. The motivation behind three design techniques that have been proposed are reviewed here, and the resulting designs are compared with respect to filter characteristics, ease of design, and methods of realization. The design techniques to be discussed include window, frequency-sampling, and equiripple designs."
"Instantaneous priority multiplexing (IPM) is a recently proposed method for transmitting a number of black-and-white pictures through a channel that would otherwise suffice for only one black-and-white picture transmission, given that a certain amount of degradation is acceptable. To analyze this system, a mathematical description has been complemented by a simulation for the human observer in order to determine its performance properties. After careful consideration it has been found that the limit between acceptable and doubtful picture quality is identical with the theoretical limit for error-free transmission using an appropriate coding delay. The bandwidth compression factor for IPM transmission varies between 6 for line drawings and 1.5 for very black sketches. For the latter, \"cross-vision\" effects may become significant. As a successful approach to guarantee the required privacy in communication systems, a simple polyomino filter has been conceived which performs a certain feature recognition and pattern reconstruction. Owing to its simplicity, bandwidth saving by this improved version of IPM is an attractive alternative to the existing efficient encoding schemes for the multiplex transmission and storage of black-and-white pictures."
"The object of this concise paper is to find statistics for the number of errors in a block ofndigits transmitted over the troposcatter channel. An approximate solution for FSK modulation is found based on bounding the Correlation between nonadjacent bits. As an application of the result, bit error probabilities were found after using the (23,12,3) Golay code. At high signal-to-noise ratio, there is an effective multiplication by 4 of the order of diversity as long as some decorrelation exists between adjacent bits."
"Operational requirements and technology advancements will mold aeronautical communications systems in the next decade. However, communications systems neither size nor configure airplanes, although they may affect design details. Configuration criteria are derived from such parameters as range, payload, and speed. Optimization of airframe and system designs requires that compatible characteristics of each be fully exploited. Therefore, the impact of airframe configurations and structural technology upon communication systems, as well as advancements in electronics technology, must be carefully considered in the early stages of new airplane development cycles (Fig. 1)."
"A proposal is presented for the interworking of preassignment and demand-assignment communication systems in future worldwide telephone networks. Considering the current and future worldwide traffic volume, the possible communication systems, especially the possible multiple-access systems, are compared. As a result, restoring the existing preassigned network by a time-division multiple-access system with demand-assigned channels appears most suitable for handling the Atlantic region traffic in 1975. The proposed interworking of the different systems will be explained with the aid of a simple network model."
"Recent advances in digital computer and optical technology have made image spectra determination practical. Pratt and Andrews [1] studied bandwidth compression using the Fourier transform of complete pictures. By treating pictures adaptively on a piecewise basis, picture detail is better represented. Also, subjective preferences of human vision can be used, which result in further improvements in picture quality. The original picture is sampled and then divided into small subsections. Each subsection is expanded in a two-dimensional Fourier series. TheL-Fourier coefficients of largest absolute value are determined for each subsection, whereLis proportional to the standard deviation of the picture samples in the subsection. The frequencies and complex amplitudes of thoseL-Fourier coefficients are transmitted. The number of quantization levels used for the Fourier coefficients in each subsection is made dependent on the standard deviation of the picture samples in the subsection, and the size of the quantum steps is made dependent on the magnitude of the largest Fourier coefficient of the subsection, aside from the average value. The frequencies of the coefficients correspond to positions in a twodimensional spatial frequency plane. These positions, or twodimensional frequencies, are transmitted by run-length coding. The process is adaptive in the sense that, its parameters vary from subsection to subsection of the picture in an effort to match the properties of the individual subsections. Subsection size and other important system constants are chosen with knowledge of the properties of human vision. We are able to obtain high-quality reconstructed pictures, using on the average 1.25 bits per picture point."
"Algorithms are presented for designing high-efficiency gradings for nonhoming selectors and for expanding an existing grading by the addition of trunks or selectors with minimal rearrangement of the grading while maintaining its efficiency. The grading design problem is formulated as a problem in constructing block designs. The block design problem is shown to be equivalent to a nonlinear programming problem. The solution to the problem is a (partially) balanced incomplete block design that is a representation of a cyclic homogeneous grading. Flowcharts of algorithms and examples are given for solutions of variants of the programming problem corresponding to 1) the expansion of a grading by the addition of a selector, 2) the expan sion of a grading by the addition of a trunk, and 3) the optimization of a homogeneous grading."
"Multiplexer-concentrators (or asynchronous multiplexers) are devices used to increase the efficiency of telecommunication systems into which the flow of information is erratic. In the analysis of such systems, many assumptions about the statistical nature of the input traffic can be made. The assumptions made here are constant message length, constrained buffer size, and finite number of message sources. The numerical technique given copes with the case of multiple output trunks, and the complete statistical behavior of the system is revealed in transient as well as steady-state form. Results are given graphically which show the effect of various statistical assumptions, the transient response of the system, the behavior of the tail of the distribution of queue states, and the effect of message clustering."
"The combined effects of filter distortion and the associated intersymbol interference on coherently detected biphase and quadriphase PSK signals are studied in white Gaussian noise. A determination is made of the system performance degradation from matched-filter detection resulting from the use of a linear channel model that focuses attention on the critical filters in the communication link. The critical filters that affect performance consist of transmission filters in the transmitter and/or transponder, receiver predetection filters, and data filters associated with the detector. Numerical results for adjacent symbol interference are given for detection using both integrate-and-dump filters as well as more general data filters, particularly an undumped 2-pole Butterworth data filter. The numerical results include symmetrical band limiting, broad-band filtering with a frequency offset, mismatched data filtering, cascaded filter chains, and the effects of pure phase distortion."

"A new data system uses AM broadcast signals to carry teleprinter signals. Useable at medium or shortwave frequencies, the multiplex technique provides point-to-point or broadcast teleprinter service utilizing existing transmitters and antennas. A minimum-bandwidth PM subcarrier is used to phase modulate the broadcast carrier wave without disturbing operation of either the broadcast transmitter or receiver."
"The switching networks of modern telephone exchanges are often built as multistage arrays which are controlled by conditional selection. Thereby, the strategy is often applied that a certain inlet in stage 1 is to be connected with a certain outlet m the last stage. The traffic loss due to nonavailability of an idle path between the two points is called point-to-point loss or point loss. A traffic models for the calculation of the point loss is defined. Then approximate methods of calculating the point loss in threeand four-stage link systems are derived. The results of calculation are compared with those obtained with a full-scale simulation of the systems investigated."
"The problems of sequence decision, sample timing, and carrier phase recovery in a class of linear modulation data transmission systems are treated from the viewpoint of multiparameter estimation theory. The structure of the maximumlikelihood estimator is first obtained, and a decision-directed receiver is then derived. These receivers are different from the conventional one in that the carrier phase is extracted from the signal components themselves in an adaptive fashion. The structure of this adaptive demodulator and detector is then extended to the case in which the channel characteristic is unknown, and the algorithm for adjusting the carrier phase and sample instant is discussed in combination with that of adaptive equalization."
"The principle of a system for video bandwidth compression by multiplexing was described in [1]. That scheme was applied to two-level images. Experimental results are given. Seven two-level images were multiplexed and a bandwidth compression by a factor of 2.6 was achieved."
"A delta modulator with a second-order network in the feedback path is considered. For zero input signal the possible modes of oscillation are determined as a function of the zero of the linear network. The method could be employed with other types of feedback networks. A comparison is made with experimental results."
"Intelligible crosstalk will occur in a multiple-carrier FM system when a gain slope versus frequency characteristic is followed by AM-PM conversion. This phenomenon can be particularly serious in a communication satellite repeater that utilizes a traveling-wave tube for output power amplification. A model that includes both amplitude saturation and AM-PM conversion is developed and the two-carrier intelligible crosstalk is calculated."
"A theoretical analysis is presented of a novel form of FM demodulator where the FM signal is a flat band of Gaussian noise. The device offers an improvement over the demodulation capability of the conventional FM receiver in the region well below the threshold and the formulas governing its operation are simple, thus the manner in which changes in the modulation parameters Affect the performance can be easily determined. Threshold curves for high- and low-deviation cases are shown and compared with the performance offered by the conventional receiver and a frequency-feedback receiver."
"A comprehensive technical study has been performed to assess the optimum voice-channel capacity of a transponder as a function of the earth-station performance (ratio of receive antenna gain to system noise temperature) for various modulation techniques such as: a) single-carrier per transponder frequencydivision multiplexing frequency modulating (FDM/FM); b) multicarrier per transponder FDM/FM; c) pulse-code modulating, coherent phase-shift keying, time-division multiple access (PCMCPSK-TDMA); and d) SPADE (single-channel per carrier PCMCPSK-FDMA), which will be used in the INTELSAT IV satellite system. This study assumes a homogeneous system, i.e., the transmit and receive earth stations use an appropriately identical antenna performance."
"The important parameters of network topology and data transmission rate are examined in the light of their effect on the design of centralized computer-communication networks. Existing algorithms for the design of centralized nets are reviewed and restrictions on their use are noted. Various methods for formulating performance constraints are presented and their suitability in the light of available traffic data is discussed. Suggestions are made concerning how existing design procedures can be extended. The motivation for such efforts stems from a need for the development of advanced prodecures that enable least costly networks to be readily configured."
"Microwave FM radio link paths concerning heavily built areas may be found to suffer from high amounts of intermodulation noise caused by multiple reflections on buildings and reflecting obstacles lying alongside the direction of propagation. Little direct information may be gained on these effects using standard techniques for measuring transmission performance. The limitations of those techniques are discussed and some additional ones are proposed allowing a more direct insight into the phenomenon. The results obtained in measurements on a real hop suffering from marked echo effects of this type are reported and discussed."
"The transmission plan associated with the toll switching plan used by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has evolved and will continue to change to take advantage of new technology in providing better transmission quality and new service capabilities. This paper describes the present network plan and quality controls that are applied. An indication is given of future trends that will affect transmission planning."
"In the interest of future studies of digital echo suppressors operating directly on PCM words and of other possible future studies involving digital attenuation, a technique for 6-dB digital attenuation without linearization of the compressed PCM words from an 8-bit 15-segment compandor (μ = 255 law) is presented. The compandor is assumed to have midtread form at the origin, and all adjacent decision levels are assumed to be separated by powers of two. Although only the results for 8-bit words are presented in detail here, the basic form of the algorithm is applicable to any length of PCM word from a 15-segment compandor. Implementation of the technique can be achieved with logic Circuits which interrogate only 3 bits of each PCM word. In addition, the algorithm is precisely equivalent to linearizing, shifting one place to the right, and recompressing each PCM word, For the 8-bit 13-segment compandor (Alaw), realization of 6-dB attenuation digitally and without linearization is an obvious and well-known procedure, but it is included for completeness."
"This paper presents a new class of criteria for the optimum Capacity assignment in store-and-forward communication networks under a total fixed-cost constraint. Compared with conventional average-delay optimization these criteria are more sensitive to the needs of the individual user. Closed-form results are attained."
"The use of helium in breathing gas mixtures for deep diving operations causes marked changes in the speech sounds of the divers. The most prominent effect is an elevation of the formant frequencies which, in conjunction with other phenomena, progressively reduces speech intelligibility as depth increases. Our analyses and investigations have shown that to correct these distortions, the following measures are required: 1) provide a passband extending to at least 10 kHz; 2) equalize high frequency losses in vocal output and in microphone response; 3) reduce voice spectrum envelope frequencies to their expected values for 1.0 atm of air; and 4) preserve the glottal rate of the talker. Recent advances in commercially available electronic signal analyzers have made possible the recording of voice spectra averaged over a wide range of time intervals (50 ms-50 s), over a wide range of frequencies (to 20 kHz) and over a total amplitude range exceeding 100 dB. These capabilities are essential in exploring the total extent of distortions that helium introduces. Analyses of helium speech by means of long term average spectra have revealed phenomena not previously reported. An electronic helium speech processor (unscrambler) incorporating appropriate corrective measures has been developed and evaluated. Its performance culminated in successful retrieval of voice intelligence from divers at 1000-ft pressure depth. Objective word intelligibility test results for corrected speech of one talker were 88 percent at 500-ft and 78 percent at 800-ft depth."
"As part of a test to determine its applicability to coaxial repeaters, a feedforward error-control system was applied to an L-4 coaxial system flat-gain amplifier operating in the frequency range of 0.5-20 MHz. The error amplifier was a duplicate to the main amplifier. With three test tones at 7.5 dBm output each applied within the last L-4 master group, modulation products in the uncompensated system were observed about 65 dB down from a single-tone level. With the error loop applied, modulation products dropped to greater than 100 dB over the range, often exceeding 110 dB. In particular, the third-order intermodulation product corresponding to A + B - C was reduced by 42 dB to - 108 dB."
"An adaptive decision feedback equalizer to detect digital information transmitted by pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) through a noisy dispersive linear channel is described, and its performance through several channels is evaluated by means of analysis, computer simulation, and hardware simulation. For the channels considered, the performance of both the fixed and the adaptive decision feedback equalizers are found to be notably better than that obtained with a similar linear equalizer. The fixed equalizer, which may be used when the channel characteristics are known, exhibits performance which is close to that of the optimum, but impractical, Bayesian receiver and is considerably superior to that of the linear equalizer. The adaptive decision feedback equalizer, which is used when the channel impulse response is unknown or time varying, has a better transient and steady-state performance than the adaptive linear equalizer. The sensitivity of the receiver structure to adjustment and quantization errors is not pronounced."
"Some of the considerations leading to the design of a three-channel narrow-band analog system for transmitting medical data, primarily electrocardiograms (EKG), over dialed connections are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of several methods of implementing such systems are compared on the basis of the general systems requirements, the nature of the data to be transmitted, and the limitations imposed by the transmission medium. One system developed for multichannel medical applications and its performance are described in some detail."
"The whole process of fundamental planning for a national telecommunication system is based on estimating and projecting accurately the demand for telephone connections. Traditional methods are inadequate when dealing with supplylimited markets, where there may be a large hidden demand. In such cases the first target may be to upgrade the system until it matches the socioeconomic level already attained by the nation and its regions. An approach to this problem is set forth including a definition of the market and its sectors, classification of areas, sampling, and surveying. Several recent examples of application of these principles to the Chilean system serve as illustrative material, and an application of traditional solutions at the regional level obtained from CCITT GAS-5 international trends is compared to the results obtained by the field approach."
"A traveling-wave tube amplifier such as those employed in frequency-division multiplexed multiple-access communication-satellite repeaters is considered. The amplifier nonlinearity is assumed to follow an error-function characteristic, and the AM-PM conversion is taken to be a quadratic function of the envelope of the input signal. An exact expression allowing for both arbitrary amounts of amplifier saturation and AM-PM conversion is derived for the autocorrelation function of the amplifier output when the input is a Gaussian bandpass process. Distortion spectra are calculated for the parameters of a typical travelingwave tube transmitter."
"Practical constructions of matched filters for the typical waveshape of pulsed signals are shown. Each filter consists of a prefilter, delay line, and attenuator. The degraduation of output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to loss factor in each prefilter is calculated."

Expressions are derived for output signal and noise power as functions of input signal-to-noise ratio, signal-to-deadzone ratio, and noise-to-deadzone ratio. The resulting output signal-to-noise ratios are plotted for the various cases."

"The amplitude of a click is defined as the output of an ideal FM demodulator at the time of occurrence of the click. It is shown that the amplitude of a click (when the carrier is unmodulated) is a function of two random variables whose join distribution function is derived under the condition that a positive click has occurred. The distribution of positive click amplitudes is derived with the carrier-to-noise power ratio (CNR) at the output of the intermediate frequency (IF) filter as a parameter The results are extended to include negative clicks. The probability density and distribution functions of click amplitudes are plotted for the special case of a rectangular IF and CNRs of 4 and 9 The effect of modulation on the distribution of click amplitudes is determined. Results are given for the special case of a sinusoidal modulating signal fully deviating the carrier and a rectangular IF"
"Communication systems that transmit samples from analog waveforms are considered. Optimum pre- and postfilters of these samples are derived. The criterion of optimality is minimization of the mean-square error in reproducing the waveforms subject to a constraint on the signal-to-noise ratio per transmitted sample. The results of this filtering are evaluated and compared to other filtering schemes."
"The problem considered is that of reducing intersymbol interference caused by time dispersive channels. Similarity between the response of a time dispersive channel and that of a cyclic algebraic encoder has led to a method of treating the dispersive channel as a linear encoder. A tapped delay line equalizer is used to complete the encoding process so that the result can be decoded and errors corrected. The tap gain vector for the equalizer is developed, and an upper bound on the probability of error is derived. The analysis and computer simulation results show that under certain conditions the error rate can be reduced by orders of magnitude."
"An analysis is presented of the performance of a synchronous digital communications system in which the clock rate of each station is established as the average of the clock rates of all incoming signals to each station. In a previous paper the steady-state frequencies and phase relationships between stations were analyzed. Here the dynamic response of various frequency-averaging system configurations are analyzed using a time-incremental computer simulation of the system. Plots of the instantaneous frequency and phase variations in response to transmission-path changes ate provided. The frequency and phase response predicted by the computer simulation was correlated against a laboratory breadboard model. Also, the final steadystate conditions predicted by the computer simulation are correlated against the steady-state changes predicted by the previous static final-value analysis."
"The communication system considered here interpolates data in the pauses in speech. Speech is gated on and off by comparing its own envelope to a threshold. At the same time a source is generating data at a fixed rate. The data are stored in a buffer, awaiting transmission during one of the gaps in speech. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of a model in which successive speech durations are assumed to be independent exponentially distributed random variables. The successive durations of silence are modeled by independent random variables that are obtained by forming the mixture distribution of two independent exponentially distributed random variables. On the basis of this model for alternating speech and silences, and an infinite buffer that is assumed to take on a continuum of states, we solve for the stationary probability density of nonzero states of the peak buffer occupancy. This enables us to determine buffer allocation as well as average delay using typical speech parameters."
"A method is outlined for maintaining digital processor control of a switching system in the event of a processor failure. The solution chosen uses a minimum of equipment consistent with high system availability. Transfer mechanisms, logic, and required software processing are discussed."
"In a fading channel, maximal ratio diversity combilling improves the average signal-to-noise ratio over thatof a single branch in proportion to the number of diversity branches combined. However, its main advantage is the reduction of the probability of deep fades. The effect of Gaussian errors in the combiner weighting factors on the probability distribution of the output signal-to-noise ratio is computed. The limits on allowable error for a specified probability of fades below any given level are indicated. The results are applied to a mobile radio example in which the weighting factor is determined from a pilot transmitted along with the signal. To keep the pilot from overlapping the signal, they are separated either in frequency or in time. In this case the Gaussian error is due to decorrelation of the pilot from the signal either because their frequency separation or their time separation is too large."
"An experimental sonar display has been designed which is unique m that it takes advantage of superior picturequality characteristics afforded by short-persistence phosphor. The function of signal retention, normally provided by long-persistence phosphor, is accomplished instead with a core memory unit used as a scan converter for rapid refresh of displayed target data. This concept is not necessarily new, but would have been imPractical to implement prior to the advent of high-speed randomaccess core memory units."
"Signal-to-quantizing-noise ratios are derived for differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) systems used to encode analog signals from first-order Markov processes into digital form. A formula is derived which takes into consideration the quantizing noise in the feedback loop. The derivation applies to DPCM encoders which are matched to the statistics of the input signal. Gaussian statistics are not required. Analytical results are verified by computer simulation."
"A new technique Of combining injection locking with indirect synchronization has been proposed. A detailed analysis of the system in a noisy environment is presented. Also considered is the effect of the low-frequency time constant of the self-bias circuit of the oscillator on the system performance."
"The use of digital techniques in delta modulation is described. Two delta modulators are described, firstly a nonlinear digital delta modulation (NDDM) system, which uses instantaneous companding and secondly, a digital syllabic companded delta modulation (DSCDM) system, which uses syllabic companding. Both these delta modulators have the following properties. 1) Digital techniques are used for most of the circuitry, anRCintegrator and a comparator being the only analogue components used. 2) The delta modulators are similar to a single integration delta modulator (SIDM) but use switched resistors in theRCintegrators. Logic circuitry is used to connect one or more resistors to either the positive or negative supply, charging or discharging the capacitor. The relative ratio of the resistors and the order in which they are switched determines the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio, the dynamic range, and whether the system has instantaneous or syllabic companding."
"Three properties of a linear transmission system optimized with respect to the mean-square error of the signal received are discussed. These are the attenuation of the main peak of a transmitted pulses the ratio of the components of the mean-square error (signal distortion and noise), and the increase of the error caused by imperfect implementation of the phases of the optimal transfer functions."
"Implementation of the algebraic section of a relatively simple sequential-algebraic error-correcting scheme for very noisy channels is detailed, and its complexity evaluated. Since one of the properties of this hybrid is that the sequential portion can be any standard sequential decoder, the description here is sufficient to specify the modifications which must be performed on a convolutional-encoder-sequential-decoder to convert it to a scheme with improved performance. The algebraic section consists of a Reed-Solomon erasure-correcting code."
"The magnitude of noise induced into communication cable from electromagnetic influences is reduced by the shielding properties of the metallic shield. One of these properties is the surface transfer impedance. The surface transfer impedance relates the current induced on one side of a shield to the longitudinal voltage appearing on the other side due to that current. At low frequencies the surface transfer impedance for nonpermeable materials is equal to the dc resistance of the shield. At high frequencies it decreases rapidly. The frequency at which the decrease begins is a function of the thickness and conductivity of the metal. For cylindrical shields having longitudinal seams, the transfer impedance increases at somewhat higher frequencies. The size of the seam opening determines the frequency at which the increase begins. Although the size of the seam opening is difficult to control, experimental results are in relatively good agreement with theoretical calculations."
"Negative impedance boosting using activeRCcircuits series connected at intervals along a cable pair has been shown to minimize loss and provide nearly distortionless bilateral transmission of either digital or analog signals. Results from computation and field measurements are in good agreement. Recently, on-line plotting with a time-shared computer has made it feasible to find the circuit parameters which minimize the remaining distortion for many commonly used cables and spacings. Parameter adjustments are shown which permit a tradeoff between bandwidth and either amplitude or phase distortion. Factors affecting pulse transmission have been investigated. In general, bandwidth is inversely related to booster spacing. Bandwidth-spacing relations are given for two cable gauges and compared with the upper bound where propagation is at light velocity. Bandwidth increases with wire size, while the bandwidthspacing product improves with reduced spacing."
"A Kalman filtering algorithm has been applied to the problem of bit synchronization in anM-ary communication system. No synchronizing signal is assumed present; the approach is arranged to determine timing information from the transitions occurring in a pseudorandom sequence of symbols, generated with a fixed but initially unknown bit rate. Procedural steps subdivide naturally into an acquisition phase (block data processing) and a track mode (recursion). The method is supported by sample binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) simulation results, obtained from the output of a 4-pole Butterworth digital filter fed by a random MARK/SPACE sequence plus additive Gaussian noise. Results demonstrate accurate determination of both the bit phase reference time and the bit period. The scope is restricted to high SNR digital communication systems, for which acceptable error rates are obtainable without sophisticated decoding schemes."
"An optimal signal design of the classical smeardesmear technique for combating impulse noise is demonstrated. The signal design makes use of calculus of variations to derive an integral equation to which several solutions are given, along with a technique for generating additional solutions. A computer simulation and an evaluation of Rice's triple integral pdf for impulse noise are used to analyze the error probability of a smear-desmear data channel and a standard data channel. This is the first known publication of a general evaluation of Rice's integral for the intermediate repetition rate case. The error rates show that the smeardesmear channel is superior only for the lower repetition rate and/or lower level impulse noise cases. An analysis is then made of a clipper before the receiving filter. It is shown that this improves the system error rate to a degree, depending on the clipping level and the preclipper bandwidth-with the wider bandwidth giving greater improvement. The smear-desmear channel experienced a greater improvement than the conventional channel, so that the smear-desmear channel can be considered superior except for very high noise levels or repetition rates; practical considerations in the preclipper bandwidth and clipping level are the limiting factors."
"A store and forward message switching system, made up of duplexed 16-bit computers, fixed head discs (FHDs), moving head discs (MHDs), and multiline controllers (MLCs) is described. The paper discusses the area of application for a system of this type, and the equipment configuration and operation of the subject system. The paper concludes with a discussion of the redundancyswitchover aspects of the system and the system size."
"Because of the nonlinear nature of quantizing and coding operations, it is not possible, in general, to derive the power spectrum for a digitally encoded signal from a knowledge of only the spectrum of the original analog signal. For video signals, however, the analog process can be modeled by the random step function. This leads to a convenient expression for the power spectral density of the digital signal with separate factors characterizing the effects of 1) digital pulse shape, 2) quantizing and coding operations, 3) scanning raster, and 4) the bandwidth of the analog signal. Experimental data from television and Picturephone® signals are presented. The results are of special significance to a hybrid analog-digital system."
"The results of comparison of the conventional Fano algorithm and a new stack algorithm proposed by Zigangirov and Jelinek, by computer simulation of two sequential decoding algorithms are reported. The results indicate that for rates near Rcompthe stack algorithm offers a considerable improvement in decoder speed over the Fano algorithm, provided that fairly large storage capacity is available for use by the decoder."
"The design of a laser transmitter that achieves maximum power transfer through the earth's turbulent atmosphere is considered. It is shown that optimum power transfer would be realized with an adaptive system that uses the appropriate beacon signal to probe the channel state. This result is applied to show that the average power gain of the optimal earth-to-space optical link is the diffraction-limited gain for the apertures in vacuum. For large transmitting apertures the percentage fluctuation about this mean gain goes to zero. Thus the fundamental limitation on power transfer imposed by the turbulence is considerably milder than had been thought."
"The multiple error performance of a phase-shift-keyed (PSK) communications system, when both cochannel interference (due possibly to other cochannel angle-modulated systems) and Gaussian noise additively perturb the transmitted signals, is considered. The results are fairly general: the main requirement is that the interference be circularly symmetric. All of our findings are also applicable to the case when only noise is present. The results indicate that one cannot approximate well the effect of interference on the performance of a PSK system by treating it as additional Gaussian noise. First, we derive the probability density function fAof the phase angle of a cosinusoid plus interference and Gaussian noise. We then obtain readily computable expressions (in terms of fA) for the probability of any number of consecutive errors in anm-phase system when either coherent or differential detection is utilized. For numerical results, the interference is assumed to be due to other cochannel angle-modulated communications systems, and the double error probability and conditional probability of error are given for 2- and 4-phase systems."
"The performance of a new modulation technique which has been called mixed-base modulation (MBM) is presented. This technique provides significant performance advantages over other common modulation techniques for applications where both power and bandwidth are limited. Its performance for bandspreading factors of two relative to single-sideband is within 4 dB of the ultimate Shannon bounds. Most available techniques are very poor in this region. The viewpoint which allowed synthesis of this technique will be given before the basic approach and its performance are discussed. A section comparing the theoretical performance of MBM and that of other common techniques is followed by a discussion of some of the practical considerations."
"Narrow-band VLF/LF antennas are broad banded by synchronously tuning the antenna to resonance at the instantaneous frequency of the FSK signal to be radiated. The broadbanding technique employed is the switched magnetically coupled reactor. By appropriately timed switching of reactors the effective inductance of the antenna tuner is maintained at or near the value for continuous radiation system resonance. For a given antenna, radiated power, and frequency shift, the number, size, and coupling of switched reactors are computed. Network poles are determined and system transient response of antenna and reactor current are determined for both up and down frequency shift. An example based on the U. S. Navy VLF antenna at Balboa, Panama, is worked out."
"Under the unified carrier concept several anglemodulated subcarriers are combined and PM on an RF carrier. As a practical matter in a hardware system the angle-modulated subcarriers will contain a certain amount of amplitude ripple. Conceptually, a subcarrier with AM ripple can be viewed as a constant envelope subcarrier with a continuously varying modulation index. It follows that a continuous transfer of AM between the components in the unified carrier spectrum will occur due to the varying envelope (modulation index) of any data subcarrier. This paper discusses in some detail the problem of crosstalk transferred to the PM carrier from a single subcarrier which is biphase modulated with pulse-code modulation (PCM) data. The implications to carrier false lock and tracking are studied. Analytic and experimental results are presented."
"The power spectral density of continuous-phase minimum-bandwidth waveforms composed from a set ofNmutuallyorthogonal chips (pulsed sinusoids of equal amplitude and duration and constant frequency) is derived. The spectrum and its derivation for this class of signals are of particular interest in highpower extremely low frequency/very low frequency (ELF/VLF) communications where noise immunity is a prime consideration, but the signal bandwidth and transients at the transmitting antenna must be minimized. Exact formulas are also given without derivation for wider bandwidth signals in the same class but of less practical importance. Although the power spectra of more general binary signals are already known, the special case presented here permits a much simpler derivation than that given in an earlier paper [1]. In theN-ary case a previously derived formula for the spectra of continuous-phase multilevel FM signals [2] is augmented and evaluated to explicitly yield new spectral formulas useful in describing the frequency-hopping mode."
"The performance of the binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) data system employing a conventional limiterdiscriminator detector is analyzed. Both additive noise and distortion produced by the transmitter and receiver bandpass filters are taken into account. Performance tradeoffs with respect to transmitter frequency deviation, bandpass filter shape, and bandpass filter bandwidth are investigated. Intersymbol interference caused by distortion is taken into account for each bit sequence by calculating two distortion factors. The first factor is related to the actual baseband signal distortion produced by the bandpass filters. The second factor is related to the power distortion caused by the bandpass filters. It is shown that both factors must be considered in determining the detrimental effect of distortion on system error probability. Three particular bandpass filter shapes are considered. They are the first-, second-, and third-order Butterworth filters. For each of these filter shapes the binary FSK data system is optimized over transmitter frequency deviation and bandpass filter bandwidth. It is found that the third-order Butterworth filter operating at a 3-dB bandwidth of1.1/THz, whereTis the bit interval, coupled with a transmitter frequency deviation of0.36/THz yields the best performance for the binary FSK system with limiterdiscriminator detection. This bandwidth (64 percent of the Carson's rule bandwidth) optimizes a tradeoff between additive noise and distortion effects. This frequency deviation optimizes a tradeoff between the spike and nonspike noise components of the discriminator output. It is shown that the performance of the optimized binary FSKlimiter-discriminator system closely approaches the performance obtained by using an optimum coherent detector on the FSK signal set."
"This investigation was conducted as part of a program of research designed 1) to develop several methodologies for the evaluation of diver communication systems and 2) to carry out these evaluations on available units. The major focus of this report is on a diver-to-diver procedure and data resulting from the evaluation of seven diver communication systems, viz: a) hard-lineAquaphone; b) acoustic-Bendix and Yack-Yack; and c) amplitude modulated-PQC-1a, PQC-2, Aquasonics 811, and Aquasonics U-42. All systems were used with a Nautilus muzzle and a double-hose regulator. Talkers were five divers experienced in such tasks; listeners were six to eight divers familiar with the talkers' speech; stimulus materials were the Clarke 50-word multiple choice lists. The following results were noted: 1) no single approach to diver communication (modulated, acoustic, hard-line) completely dominated the results; 2) the use of optimum (currently available, that is) muzzle-regulator combinations, a closed set of speech materials, and procedures where talkers' speech was familiar to the listeners, all operated to improve the intelligibility of communication; 3) the performance of the military systems was poorer than that of the commercial ones; and 4) these systems-even when used optimally-still do not provide adequate communication for divers."
"Decoding of a correlative level coding or partialresponse signaling system is discussed in an algebraic framework. A correction scheme in which the quantizer Output includes ambiguity levels is proposed. The implementation and algorithm of error correction is discussed in some detail. An optimum design of the quantizer based on Chow's earlier work is discussed. Both analytical and simulation results on the performance of the proposed decoding scheme are presented. An asymptotic expression for the decoding error rate is derived in closed form as a function of the channel signal-to-noise ratio. This is also compared with the conventional bit-by-bit detection method and the maximumlikelihood decoding method recently studied."
"The subscriber loop multiplexer is a combined carrier and switching system for serving 80 main stations on 24 channels. The system has been designed for use in rural areas to handle growth and upgrading from multiparty service toward individual service. The system consists of a control terminal and up to six remote terminals located near the customers being served. The system is digital and uses a bit rate of 1.544 Mbit/s for the repeatered line interconnecting the terminals. The system has many maintenance provisions and alarms that have been economically achieved through digital integrated circuits. The test desk can initiate a series of tests on the voice frequency loop extending from the remote terminal to the customer. Delta modulation provides a simple and economic conversion between analog and digital forms. At the remote terminals each main station Served has an individual modem allowing equipment to be added as required to serve customers. The system utilizes 14 codes of beam-lead integrated circuits of which 10 are bipolar and 4 are insulated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET). The IGFETs provide the adaptive delta modulation control and also perform the time division switching function at the remote terminals."
"An adaptive version of the basic delta modulator employing full-width pulses andRCintegration is described. A digital technique is used to sense the slope of the input signal and to control the amplitude of the pulses supplied to theRCnetwork in the feedback loop. Subjective testing with speech signals and a modulator clock rate of 56 kbit/s has indicated a useful volume range of 40 dB for commercial telephony-grade performance. At a clock rate of 19.2 kbit/s a signal-quantization noise ratio of 16 dB has been obtained over a dynamic input range of 20 dB for an 800-Hz sine wave. Also described is an application of the adaptive delta modulator known as the Adaptifon system in which the compression and expansion circuits of Lincompex are realized by the delta modulation technique. Speech is transmitted in analog form at constant amplitude, which, together with an FM syllable rate channel, occupies the conventional 3-kHz bandwidth. The receiving system has the capability of removing fading from signals transmitted over an HF path."
"A description of a computer operated radio-frequency automatic test system that was used to measure several spurious responses of the mixerP-Qtype in a high-frequency radio receiver is presented. Test results are given, and the choice of components for the system is discussed briefly."
 "\"Delay modulation,\" originally developed in conjunction with high density digital (saturation) tape recoding, combines the advantages of narrow bandwidth of pulse-code modulation (PCM) nonreturn to zero (NRZ) and the advantages of self-timing information inherent in phase modulation. This paper describes a decoding technique for the conversion of delay-modulated digital data to NRZCdata. A potential time-phase ambiguity in reception and decoding of delay-modulated data is resolved in real time, through monitoring the data stream for a unique waveform inherent in delay-modulated data. Statistical backup is provided. Included are logic implementation and timing diagrams."
"Although long rural routes comprise less than 2 percent of the total Bell System loop plant, they pose serious transmission and economic problems. Planning for adequate transmission and lowest costs is facilitated by a new voice-frequency electronics plus cable design procedure that provides for an 8-dB EML and a 15-20 percent cost saving over conventional resistance design. Additional cost savings of the same order, together with improvements in noise and loss, are expected in the future through the use of distributed digital multiplexing. The rural-route data base gathered to assure accuracy in economic and service comparisons, together with the studies leading to both the near-term voice frequency plan and the ultimate multiplexing proposals, are described."
"It is suggested that frequency errors in the reinserted carrier in SSB voice reception, such as result from doppler shift of the incoming signal or oscillator drift, may be corrected by an AFC arrangement utilizing the sidebands themselves. The technique depends on the fact that the loudest speech sounds are rich in harmonics of the vibration rate of the vocal cords. This harmonic spectrum can be established, essentially independently of receiver tuning, by diode rectifying the incoming sideband energy while it is at radio or intermediate frequency. The AFC compares the spectral content of the output of the normal SSB (or product) detector with that of the diode detector; it then adjusts the frequency of the reinserted carrier until frequency components of the two audio signals properly overlap. Reinserted-carrier-frequency correction may be accomplished either by a phase-locking procedure or by a control depending on frequency rather than phase difference. The latter method appears to be able to reduce deviations as large as 1 or 2 kHz by an order of magnitude or better. The technique should be applicable when one terminal of a link is a rapidly moving aircraft or satellite and when the doppler shift is unpredictable or time varying. Another application is in marine, aeronautical, or mobile radiotelephony where economic considerations prevent use of frequency standards of adequate stability. The AFC circuit could be niade compatible with AM."

"Intersymbol interference upper error bounds are calculated for the Gaussian-weighted sinc and raised-cosine families by using the Chernoff bound since this technique yields a value smaller than the worst case bound. A comparison between the two families is based on error rates and bandwidth."
 "This tutorial paper begins with an elementary presentation of the fundamental properties and structure of convolutional codes and proceeds with the development of the maximum likelihood decoder. The powerful tool of generating function analysis is demonstrated to yield for arbitrary codes both the distance properties and upper bounds on the bit error probability for communication over any memoryless channel. Previous results on code ensemble average error probabilities are also derived and extended by these techniques. Finally, practical considerations concerning finite decoding memory, metric representation, and synchronization are discussed."
"This correspondence is concerned with the analysis of the general phase-locked loop in which the received signal is frequency modulated by a process modeled as random noise filtered by a low-pass filter, together with additive stationary noise. The approximate solution by Fokker-Planck techniques is discussed as the near-threshold problem of an(m + 1)th-order loop."
"A detector in which the reference is derived from the incoming signal by a form of waveform synthesis utilizing positive feedback is capable of demodulating a variety of types of transmission, including single-sideband and double-sideband (carrierless) waves. With single-sideband transmissions the system permits the detection of weak signals without the problem of stray pickup from the reference oscillator and displays an inherent rate-of-change limiting action against impulse-type noise. With double-sideband waves (with or without carrier) it makes full use of the sideband energy in the two halves of the signal spectrum and maintains its effectiveness against impulse-type interference. With any type of AM transmission having correlated upper and lower sidebands it removes much of the distortion associated with selective fading."
"An atmospheric noise model for analyzing the performance of modulation/demodulation systems operating at VLF frequencies is presented. Performance analyses of various modems based on this noise model are compared with experimental measurements. Theoretical and experimental results are categorized by long integration time, short integration time, and nonlinear IF processing."
"An operational one-way error correcting system has been constructed and tested at teleprinter speeds. The short onethird rate code was heavily interleaved and decoded using \"minimum distance decocling,\" All system functions, including timing controls, were tested under single and dual diversity over 1300-km VHF and 1500-km HF paths, subject to a wide range of binary error rates. Test results showed differences in coder performance between the VHF and HF channels. Statistics of a secondary decoder output, called the inversion count, are given in a form useful for error detection, word erasure, or other feedback applications."
"The Fourier transform data communication system is a realization of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) in which discrete Fourier transforms are computed as part of the modulation and demodulation processes. In addition to eliminating the bunks of subcarrier oscillators and coherent demodulators usually required in FDM systems, a completely digital implementation can be built around a special-purpose computer performing the fast Fourier transform. In this paper, the system is described and the effects of linear channel distortion are investigated. Signal design criteria and equalization algorithms are derived and explained. A differential phase modulation scheme is presented that obviates any equalization."
"In a recent paper, P. McManamon derived the average bit error rate for the simple partitioned Markov channel. This correspondence derives the same result by a simpler and more straightforward way."
"This paper describes two communication systems in which convolutional coding with Viterbi maximum likelihood decoding plays a major role. The paper contains a functional description of the system, presents some of the thinking that contributed to the design, and gives some performance curves based on computer simulation and laboratory measurements."
"This report describes the development of a wide-band frequency-modulated oscillator with the following design goals: 1) direct modulation at a center frequency of 70 MHz; 2) instantaneous frequency deviation-±10 MHz; 3) linearity-within ±1 percent to ±10 MHz; 4) deviation rate (baseband response)-±0.5 dB from 100 Hz to 10 MHz; 5) provision for automatic frequency control."
"An experimental error control system utilizing a generalized burst-trapping error control technique has been designed, built, and evaluated. Code parameters were chosen such that bursts as long as 1000 bits are likely to be corrected in the presence of a background random bit error rate as large as3 \\times 10^{-3}. In this paper we give a brief description of generalized burst-trapping codes, we discuss the design and implementation of the decoder, and we describe the performance evaluation."
"In this paper, the output of a differentially coherent detector using the phase of thekth previous bit as a reference is derived under noise free conditions for binary differential phase shift keyed signals, wherek = 1, 2, 3 ...or ally integer. This is then related to the output of a conventional differentially coherent detector (k = 1). In the presence of noise, this output relationship changes depending on which detector has made an error in detection. This property can be used to reduce the error rate for differentially coherent systems. A receiver consisting of a first-order (conventional) and second-order detectors, where the references are the phase of the previous and second previous bits, respectively, is analyzed theoretically. The result shows that the amount of improvement in error rate due to the addition of the second-order detector depends on the percentage of single errors in the conventional detector. If the error rate of a conventional differentially coherent system is close to the optimum, the theoretical improvement using the additional detector is small (≃ 0.2 dB). However, it is shown experimentally that if the original performance is poor due to intersymbol interference, then considerable improvement is possible with an additional detector (≃ 1.6 dB). In addition to error rate improvement, the circuit also provides error rate information that can be used for in-service performance monitoring and as a sensor for automatic equalizers."
"Convolutional coding and Viterbi decoding, along with binary phase-shift keyed modulation, is presented as an efficient system for reliable communication on power limited satellite and space channels. Performance results, obtained theoretically and through computer simulation, are given for optimum short constraint length codes for a range of code constraint lengths and code rates. System efficiency is compared for hard receiver quantization and 4 and 8 level soft quantization. The effects on performance of varying of certain parameters relevant to decoder complexity and cost is examined. Quantitative performance degradation due to imperfect carrier phase coherence is evaluated and compared to that of an uncoded system. As an example of decoder performance versus complexity, a recently implemented 2-Mbit/s constraint length 7 Viterbi decoder is discussed. Finally a comparison is made between Viterbi and sequential decoding in terms of suitability to various system requirements."
"The lack of representativeness in the existing analysis concerning the problem of estimation of bit error rates for narrowband digital communications in the presence of atmospheric burst noise, arising due to the omission of consideration of the structure and time parameters of the noise bursts, is emphasized. A method of analysis in which these parameters can suitably be introduced is indicated. Areas in which further noise data is to be acquired are identified."
"All existing phase-jitter measuring techniques are limited in their ability to discern contributions of components greater than one-quarter of the carrier frequency. The digital technique used in this instrument measures the per-cycle differences in period directly to the nearest tenth of a degree. These deviations are summed over an appropriate number of cycles and displayed as average phase jitter. By storing the largest per-cycle discontinuity, true phase hits may be recorded. In both of the above measuring modes, no filters are used; hence, all phase jitter components contribute to the reading. With the aid of a unique phase-lock loop, any audio signal (300 Hz-3 kHz) may be used as the carrier."
"A new approach to asynchronous multiple access communications is presented. The technique, employing orthogonal convolutional coding and Viterbi decoding, is described and its performance characteristics are derived for the case in which other-user interference is the only source of noise. Results indicate that the technique is quite efficient in terms of the number of users supportable at a specified bit error rate in a given system bandwidth. Furthermore, the results of a design study are described, showing that the technique is a practical one to implement."
"The phase model for the generalized multifilter phaselock loop (M PLL) is considered and state equations for this model are derived. A linear analysis is presented to aid in the preliminary design of an M PLL and to indicate the noise improvement over a conventional phase-lock loop (PLL). Performance characteristics are examined for an M PLL with low-pass and bandpass characteristics used in a specific FM communication system. Both single and double sinusoidal FM are used and a region of proper operation of the M PLL is determined in terms of modulation index and modulating frequency. These results are obtained from both analog and digital computer simulation of the nonlinear system."
"A computer-aided optimization method for wide-band equalization of telephone pairs is presented. The method was developed specifically for the automatic design of networks, whose principal aim is to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of the deviations from flat response. The program accepts a set of loss values either measured or computed from the distributed parameters and finds, by an original minimization strategy, an optimized transfer function. An activeRCnetwork is used to synthesize this function. Network sensitivity is also evaluated and a procedure is given to calculate the component tolerances. This design technique is being used successfully for the design of equalizers. Some experimental results are given."
"A simple procedure for evaluating the performance of various types of error-correcting codes is presented. First, the HF channel is modeled for error-rate calculations as a time-varying binary symmetric channel. Second, as an example of this procedure, the model is applied to data collected on a particular midtatitude HF channel with a 1200 bit/s frequency-shift keyed modem to determine the probability of error for a number of interleaved random-error-correcting block codes."
"The need to improve transmission through routine testing of program circuits for the effect of nonlinear distortion has long been recognized. Equipment has been developed for making such an evaluation on a \"one-shot\" basis, consistent with standards set up by the Video Transmission Engineering Advisory Committee (VITEAC) and Bell Telephone Laboratories. This equipment is a pair of special purpose test instruments, a signal generator, and a distortion detector. The signal generator provides three precisely controlled sinusoidal audio signals, a low-frequency and a highfrequency tone, either singly or simultaneously, and a reference tone. The distortion detector is a two-tone selective voltmeter that measures harmonic distortion directly in decibels below the received reference tone level. Among the parameters that can be measured are harmonic distortion, line loss, line noise, and flatness of transmission."
"The purpose of this paper is to organize and clarify the work of the past decade on burst-correcting codes. Our method is, first, to define an idealized model, called the classic bursty channel, toward which most burst-correcting schemes are explicitly or implicitly aimed; next, to bound the best possible performance on this channel; and, finally, to exhibit classes of schemes which are asymptotically optimum and serve as archetypes of the burstcorrecting codes actually in use. In this light we survey and categorize previous work on burst-correcting codes. Finally, we discuss qualitatively the ways in which real channels fail to satisfy the assumptions of the classic bursty channel, and the effects of such failures on the various types of burst-correcting schemes. We conclude by comparing forward-error-correction to the popular alternative of automatic repeat-request (ARQ)."
"Previous space applications of sequential decoding have all employed convolutional codes of the systematic type where the information sequence itself is used as one of the encoded sequences. This paper describes a class of rate 1/2 nonsystematic convolutional codes with the following desirable properties: 1) an undetected decoding error probability verified by simulation to be much smaller than for the best systematic codes of the same constraint length; 2) computation behavior with sequential decoding verified by simulation to be virtually identical to that of the best systematic codes; 3) a \"quick-look-in\" feature that permits recovery of the information sequence from the hard-decisioned received data without decoding simply by modulo-two addition of the received sequences; and 4) suitability for encoding by simple circuitry requiring less hardware than encoders for the best systematic codes of the same constraint length. Theoretical analyses are given to show 1) that with these codes the information sequence is extracted as reliably as possible without decoding for nonsystematic codes and 2) that the constraints imposed to achieve the quicklook-in feature do not significantly limit the error-correcting ability of the codes in the sense that the Gilbert bound on minimum distance can still be attained under these constraints. These codes have been adopted for use in several forthcoming space missions."
"We describe the design of a rate-1/2 hard-decision sequential decoder capable of operation at data rates up to 5 M bit/s. Test results are given for digitally generated errors, white noise, and real channels. The results are substantially in agreement with predictions of a coding gain of the order of 5 dB at a 10-5error rate."
"Wide-band multiple frequency-shift keying is perturbed by random phases in theM \\geq 2frequency slots. We consider a coded digital system, where theMphases can be treated as mutually dependent random variables. If their joint distribution is known, the optimum (maximum-likelihood) receiver is shown to be in general very complicated. We show that there are a few phase distributions and signal-to-noise-ratio extremes for which the optimum receiver and its performance can be simply described. If the joint phase distribution is not known, we give an appropriate minimax receiver with a guaranteed performance. This performance is evaluted for orthogonal coding, white Gaussian noise, and nonfading signals. It is valid for all joint phase distributions."
"Four forward error correction techniques are examined and their performance compared on several real channels. Techniques of both adaptive and nonadaptive block and convolutional coding are examined. The Golay code is considered in a randomerror correcting mode and in an adaptive burst-random modes. Both versions employ interleaving as an added error correction aid. The adaptive convolutional code is a diffuse threshold-decoded Gallager code requiring a variable guard space, while the nonadaptive is a Massey code. The codes are commonly used rate 1/2 codes. The codes are evaluated and compared on three channels: a transcontinental HF 4800 bit/s channel between San Diego, Calif., and Bedford, Mass.; a mixed wireline microwave troposcatter 2400 bit/s channel dominated by a 583-mi troposcatter hop; and a 2400 bit/s satellite communications circuit from Ascension Island to Andover, Me., with wireline transmission from Andover, Me., to Greenbelt, Md. All three channels exhibit burst errors with the error rate decreasing and the burst error density increasing in the order in which channels were identified. The adaptive codes are shown to perform better than nonadaptive codes, although the difference is less significant for convolutional codes. Furthermore, the convolutional codes give better performance than nonconcatenated block codes."
"A performance coefficient corresponding to an extended form of the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of an estimatorcorrelator detector is introduced and discussed. A suboptimum approach is then considered to the detection of signals transmitted through a purely random channel and corrupted by additive Gaussian noise, with arbitrary signal-to-noise ratios at the channel output. An estimator-correlator detector is postulated and the linear filter that maximizes the performance coefficient is determined. This performance coefficient is then once more maximized with respect to the transmitted waveform and the results of this analysis are applied to cases characterized by arbitrary large signal-to-noise ratios and Gaussian quasi-stationary undersea acoustic channels."
"The assessment of imperfect channels in data transmission usually involves noise considerations. Channel imperfections are related to system performance by determining the increase in carrier-to-noise ratio required to maintain a fixed error rate. The impairment is determined by examining the \"eye\" pattern, which shows the effective reduction in signal amplitude caused by intersymbol interference. This paper derives the eye function for the binary quadratic receiver. The binary instantaneous frequency discriminator, the differential phase shift receiver, and the noncoherent frequencyshift keying (FSK) receiver implemented using the difference of two envelopes are binary quadratic receivers. The eye pattern is easily obtained by computation using the eye function."
"A digital multifrequency (MF) tone-generating system for a pulse-code-modulation (PCM) time-division multiplexed (TDM) exchange has been developed as well as the tone injection system necessary for outpulsing desired tone information in a TDM network. The tone pair is generated by reading in a predetermined sequence a memory store that contains a few binary words representing a presynthesized waveform. The necessary tone can be injected into an outgoing digital stream merely by enabling digital cross points. The system was developed and constructed for theT1transmission format, using currently available medium scale integration (MSI) circuits and semiconductor read-only memories (ROM). The experimental results are described. The proposed system differs conceptually from the conventional analog approach and results in a more economical system with improved stability, speed, and reliability."
"Some rearrangeable switching networks are developed by considering some familiar sorting procedures. The basic switching element in these networks is a two-state device (essentially a doublepole double-throw (DPDT) switch) that can be controlled by a comparator circuit in most cases. The complexity of the networks is discussed in terms of the number of these two-state devices and the number of stages m which these devices can be operated in parallel. Networks having more input ports than output ports are also considered."
"In a recent paper [1] the authors obtained the pre- and postfilters that minimize the mean-square error between the messagex(t)and its received replica\\hat{x}(t)under very general conditions on bothx(t)and the communication system under consideration. The present work compares the subjective effects of systems using optimum mean-square filters (OF) with those using conventional ideal low-pass filters (LF). The systems considered are pulse-amplitude (PAM), pulse-code (PCM), and differential pulsecode (DPCM) modulation systems for voice communication. For reasons presented in this paper, the OF and LF have double-sided bandwidth equal to the sampling frequency. In PAM systems, a white Gaussian channel model is assumed, while negligible channel transmission errors are assumed for PCM and DPCM systems. The subjective evaluation, based on preference tests, shows that subjective differences between PAM systems with OF and systems with LF are insignificant and are independent of sampling frequency and channel signal-to-noise ratio. Also, for those values of sampling frequency and number of bits of quantization considered, no significant differences exist between DPCM systems with OF and systems with LF. For PCM systems, however, significant improvement in subjective performance can be achieved when OFs are used instead of LFs."
"Functional specification of call processing in a telephone switching system became more complicated with the progress of common control systems, especially of stored program controlled electronic switching systems, which enabled the introduction of new service features. One approach by state transition diagram that is now widely adopted in Japan is explained and discussed. Since a telephone switching system is one of the sequential machines, the state transition concept is applied to describe its functions. States are assigned to calls and an exact state transition concept is somewhat modified to meet the switching needs. Rules for writing a diagram and decomposition of states for reduction and simplification of states are some of the topics discussed. The results gained from actual application to local and toll switching systems are also shown."
"A new facility for recording and subsequent computer processing of telephone calls has been developed at the Technical University of Norway. The equipment is intended for connection to a PABX of conventional electromechanical design. It is fully electronic and is based on cyclic scanning of up to 128 trunk-line circuits. The recording medium is digital magnetic tape and data are collected, arranged, and temporarily stored in a core buffer store before being transferred to tape. The central control unit of the equipment is based on wired logic with integrated circuits. Extension numbers are automatically identified by means of a Dimond ring encoder. The primary objective of the facility is the accounting of outgoing calls. However, it has proved to be very well suited for traffic data recording and analysis. The paper contains a description of the recording equipment and discusses further the applications for accounting and traffic analysis, of which a few examples are presented. A comprehensive treatment with emphasis on statistical presentation will be prepared for separate publication later."
"Calculations are made for the probability of error of a wide-band FSK receiver of the type used in space telemetry when multipath reflections off the planetary surface cause signal fading. The error probability is found for both low and high fading bandwidths and for small or large reflected path delays."
"This paper describes a sequential decoding machine built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which uses a 3-bit quantization of the code symbols and achieves a computation rate of MHz. This machine is flexible and can be programmed to decode any complementary convolutional code with rates down to 1/4 and contraint lengths up to 32. In addition, metric programmability is provided for optimization of decoder performance with respect to channel parameter variations."
"A general expression for the probability density function of the output of a correlator has been obtained and plotted using a low-pass multiplier analogy. Each of the two input channels of the correlator has a specular signal in the presence of bandlimited Gaussian noise. In the general case considered here, the noise components in the two input channels are permitted to have in-phase correlation. However, the variances of each noise component and the signal-to-noise ratio in each channel are assumed to be the same. Using the general expression, the probability density function of the output for uncorrelated noise inputs with or without the signal has also been obtained and compared with previously published results."
"Block coding has been in wide use in the errordetection and retransmission mode. It has also been used in some systems with a combination of forward error correction and retransmission techniques. In this paper, a brief survey and discription of those block-coding techniques is given that are likely to be useful in practical data transmission systems."
"An approximate expression is derived for the output power spectral density in the baseband of an angle-modulated signal interfered with by another such signal when the receiver includes a linear bandpass filter. The expression assumes that the filter negligibly affects the desired signal and that the interference is small."
"The application of information feedback to amplitudemodulated (AM) laser communication systems used to transmit the value, of a continuous parameter is considered. The laser system is assumed to be quantum-noise limited. The particular information feedback technique used is here termed feedback averaging. It is found that the use of this technique improves the accuracy of the estimate of the parameter at the receiver over a corresponding one-way system. The effect of a multiplicative error (slow fading for example), background shot noise, and the fluctuation in the photon arrivals at the receiver due to the laser itself are considered. Both experimental and simulation results bear out the analysis. A Chebyshev bound for the probability of error is derived for the special case of anM-ary AM system, both with and without feedback."
"The traditional figure of merit in comparing the economics of telecommunication transmission systems has been the annual cost per voice-circuit mile at full capacity. While this is a useful measure in some types of comparisons, it does not provide a particularly meaningful measure of the costs borne by the users of a transmission system. The users are expected to pay the average costs. The average cost per voice-circuit mile provided by a transmission system is very sensitive to starting circuit requirements and the rate of growth in these requirements. The large cross section system can only be economical on routes with high starting circuit requirements and/or high growth rates. Lower capacity systems may be considerably more economical on routes with modest requirements. This paper investigates the annual costs of three modern transmission systems; TD-3, L-4 (20 tube), and L-5 (22 tube). Annual costs for each year and average annual costs for the program period are calculated and plots of the sensitivity of these costs to variations in the input assumptions are provided."

"An optimum adaptive delta modulator-demodulator configuration is derived. This device utilizes two past samples to obtain a step size which minimizes the mean square error for a Markov Gaussian source. The optimum system is compared using computer simulations with the linear delta modulator and an enhanced Abate delta modulator. In addition the performance is compared to the rate distortion bound for a Markov source. It is shown that the optimum delta modulator is neither quantization nor slope-overload limited. The highly nonlinear equations obtained for the optimum transmitter and receiver are approximated by piecewise-linear equations in order to obtain system equations which can be transformed into hardware. The derivation of the experimental system is presented. The experimental \"optimum\" system, an enhanced version of the Abate delta modulator and a linear delta modulator were tested and compared using sinusoidal, square-wave, and pseudorandom binary sequence inputs. The results show that the output signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio is approximately independent of the input signal power and is subject only to the limitations of the hardware employed. In addition, voice was recorded using these systems. The demodulated voice indicates negligible degradation is caused by the optimum system and by the enhanced Abate system while the linear delta modulator suffers significant degradation at a sampling frequency of 56 k/s. The systems were also tested at 19.2 k/s. At this bit rate, speech recognition, using the experimental \"optimum\" system, remained completely intelligible."

"An element differential quantizer has been used to encode three baseband components of a color Picturephone® type signal in real time. The first part of this paper is concerned with an investigation of the extra bits required to transmit chrominance information over that required for a high-quality luminance signal (coded to 4 bits per picture element). We have found that a total allocation of 1 bit per picture element to the chrominance signals leads to a high-quality color display. The second part of the paper concerns an investigation of a more efficient coding format for color sigaals. In this regard, we have determined that the color signal can be packaged into a 6.3-Mbit/s rate by allocating 12 levels for the luminance component, 6 levels for one chrominance component, and 4 levels for the other chrominance component. Only one chrominance component is transmitted each line and the missing component is obtained by line averaging. The best results were obtained by coding chrominance signals that were matrixed such that their color axes lay between theIandQand color difference axes. A scheme is suggested for simply combining this type of coder with an analog color signal that has the chrominance information compressed into the blanking portion of the signal."
"A simple technique for obtaining a great deal of accurate information about FM clicks is described. General comments concerning click shapes are made."
"A new key telephone system, which uses four-wire connections between the telephone stations and the electronic key service unit, is described. The drastic reduction in the number of conductors results from the transfer of logic functions from the telephone stations to a central controller. Supervision and control signals are provided by a frequency division multiplex arrangement."
"This paper is concerned with the performance of partially coherent digital phase modulation (DPM) systems employing a class of binary signaling waveforms containing a zero crossing within each bit period. The class of waveforms includes the Manchester II bit code and sinusoidal bit code as well as an infinite number of other nonrectangular bit shapes. We wish to study the tradeoff between the RF bandwidth and the probability of bit errorP(E)as a function of bit shape. The equation describing the RF power spectrum for these DPM signals is obtained using a two-dimensional Fourier transform technique and is shown to contain both continuous and discrete terms. The spectra are evaluated numerically for a typical bit rate showing the effect of different bit shapes. An original technique is presented for including the effects of modulation interference on the extraction of the carrier-phase reference from these DPM signals using a partially coherent phase-locked-loop receiver. The expression for theP(E)is obtained for the class of signals and is a function of the phase deviation angle and the modulation interference. This expression is evaluated numerically to obtain sets of curves that show the optimal phase deviation angles for five members of the class. The tradeoff between the RF bandwidth and theP(E)is given by a curve that indicates the increase inP(E)for a reduction in RF bandwidth as a function of the bit shape."
"A straightforward technique for optimum (minimum cost) design of digital radio relay systems is given. The same technique with small modifications is also applied to analog FDM-FM systems. The total cost of a multihop radio relay system including transceiver, antenna, feeder, and mast expenses is considered by developing the cost functions for different component parts, i.e., the dependence of component price on the performance. After this the required component performances are derived based on the system specifications and the assumed mathematical model of propagation. Thus, the total cost can be minimized to get the optimum hop length and cost balance between transmitter, receiver, antenna, and mast. To illustrate the approach in a practical situation, calculations are carried out for a medium capacity digital and analog system."
"A technique for designing a sampled-data version of the approximate inverse of a class of linear systems is described. Coefficients of the inverse are computed from a polynomial formed by taking equispaced samples of the impulse response of the given linear system. Long division has previously been used [2], [11] to invert polynomials. The quotient, however, does not converge when some roots of the polynomial lie outside the unit circle in the complex plane. In a general case, therefore, the method [3], [2], [11] used depended on the determination of roots of high-degree polynomials, a very time consuming computation. The method described here involves continued long division with proper treatment of the remainder. It is applicable in all cases except when the polynomial to be inverted has a root on the unit circle. The technique lends itself to machine computation and requires only a time-domain description of the system whose inverse is to be found. It is, therefore, suitable for the evaluation of tap gains of transversal filters used for automatic equalization of data transmission systems. It may also be used to design the inverse in the form of a recursive digital filter. The performance of nonrecursive and recursive equalizers designed by this method is compared with the zero forcing (ZF) and the least mean square (LMS) equalizers. The technique described here tends to minimize peak distortion as does the ZF method, however it is shown to work even when the initial peak distortion is greater than 100 percent and the ZF method may fail. Moreover, the method selects a favorable position for the reference tap thus sometimes resulting in less mean-square distortion than the LMS equalizer with the reference tap in the center."
"An adaptive dual-mode coding system for television signals is described. Its main features are a low bit rate (1.5 bits per sample), the high quality of the reproduced picture, and its moderate hardware. The system is based on the statistical properties of video signals. Specifically, it makes use of the nonuniform spectrum of video signals in the form of a differential scheme containing linear prediction. Furthermore, areas of small amplitude changes between consecutive samples whose probability of occurrence is high are encoded with a reduced coding alphabet. Transients representing sharp edges in the picture are encoded and reproduced with little slope overload and busyness. A method for the buffering of the asynchronous data stream produced by the coder to match a synchronous channel is given."
"The paper describes an experimental system constructed to allow investigation of pseudorandom dither signals for coarse quantization of 625-line monochrome television siginals. The system employs a separate encoder/decoder for the television synchronizing pulses so that the picture signal can be allowed to occupy the full nonsaturating range of the video encoder. Dither samples are added to the video signal before coding and subtracted at the decoder and are negatively correlated to maximize the picture signal-to-noise ratio according to a subjective noise weighting function. The power spectral distribution of the quantizing noise is derived and, assuming this to be picture independent and random, pre- and deemphasis networks are used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Empirical methods are used to determine the network parameters. The results of preliminary subjective experiments with the 3 bits/sample pseudorandom codec are given for a sampling frequency of 12 MHz and indicate the practical limitations of a theory which predicts a high standard of picture quality."
"The probability density function and autocorrelation function of random FM in a mobile radio system are derived for the case where postdetection selection diversity is used. Closed-form solutions for the autocorrelation function have been found for no diversity and two-branch diversity and infinite series expansions for higher orders. The use of two-branch selection diversity is shown to reduce the random FM by 13.5 dB in a typical case, with a further 2.5-dB reduction when three branches are used. The effect of other forms of diversity on random FM is briefly assessed, but not pursued in detail."
"An easily implemented estimator of the amplitude (including sign) of a sine wave of known phase is described. The performance of this estimator when zero-mean Gaussian noise is added to the signal is then determined by computing its probability density, mean, and second moment. These statistics are shown to converge to those of the maximum likelihood estimate for large values of signal-to-noise ratio."
"For non-Gaussian frequency modulation of a sinusoidal carrier, a general method for the calculation of the spectral density is not available. As has been shown by Blachman, we treat here low-deviation frequency modulation by a general stationary low-pass random process and show that, to first order, the modulated wave has a single-pole spectrum. We also present a higher order estimate for the spectrum, which differs from that of Blachman and appears more satisfactory."
"Extraction of a timing wave from PCM baseband signals through a square law device is studied. The relationship between waveforms and systematic jitter in the timing wave is derived. A criterion for jitter free equalization is obtained. Examples of waveforms that satisfy the criterion are given. Maximum jitters for some practical waveforms are given by numerical examples."
"We present a review of the telecommunication possibilities for terminals that are buried in the earth or submerged in the sea. The important role of the operating frequency is stressed. Without being comprehensive, we discuss the relevance of the large number of theoretical papers on electromagnetic waves in conducting media. Our most important recommendation is that the highfrequency band be given more attention for telecommunication between terminals buried just beneath the air-ground interface. Also, we suggest that future research be directed towards the investigation of the frequency dependence of the conductivity and permittivity of geological materials."
"This paper describes an experiment that was performed to study the subjective effects of noise and loss on actual telephone calls made within the Murray Hill location of Bell Telephone Laboratories. The effects of noise and loss on talker volume as well as on transmission quality ratings are discussed. A joint transmission grade of service is obtained, which shows, for various distributions of noise and loss in the circuit, the expected percentage of customers rating the circuit quality as \"good or better,\" and \"poor or worse.\""
"Transatlantic communication cables have been in use for more than a century. Studies indicate that more than half of the failures in telegraph cables in the past were due to fishing activity. Since 1956 high-capacity telephone cables have largely replaced telegraph cables. In these new cables 95 percent of all breaks have been due to fishing trawlers. To protect against this hazard a plow was developed that buries cable to a depth of up to 60 cm under the ocean bottom. The plow, which weighs 15 000 kg, is towed at 1 km/h and can bury cable in water depths up to 600 m. It incorporates about 50 sensors and controls including underwater TV, hydrophone, hydraulic and electrical systems, attitude, tension, and speed indicators. A 9000 hp icebreaker-cable ship is used to pull the plow. Typical plowing tensions of 15 000 kg force with peaks as great as 47 000 kgf have been recorded. By the end of 1969 about 500 km of undersea telephone cable had been buried in coastal areas off the United States, Spain, and Italy."
"The output of a real discriminator is a nonlinear functional of the instantaneous frequency of its input signal. This functional may be separated into a linear term (the only significant term as the FM deviation goes to zero) and a distortion term. To remove the distortion, a feedback arrangement is proposed in which, after a subtraction, the discriminator output is passed through the inverse of the linear functional to obtain the desired output. The latter is fed to a circuit representing the distortion functional (to obtain what must be subtracted in the manner just described)."
"A large number of IBM 2750 system configurations is available. Any particular 2750 system configuration runs under control of a personalized program package, and each personalized program package is generated on a remote system/360 using as input a generalized program package, written in a macro assembly language, in conjunction with a set of configuration parameters. The output of the generation process is a set of absolute binary paper tapes which are loaded directly into the 2750 system. The reliability of the personalized program package is ensured by running it under the control of a program that simulates the operation of the 2750 system. This paper describes the structure of the generalized program package and the technique used for the generation and simulation of personalized program packages."
"The response of an FM discriminator to a fading signal is derived, taking into account the below-threshold noise and the effect of various diversity techniques. The effect of muting the discriminator output at low signal levels is considered and shown to achieve only marginal improvement. The diversity techniques considered are maximal-ratio combining, selection diversity, and equalgain combining. Only predetection combining is considered for the maximal-ratio and equal-gain techniques. The average SNR at the discriminator output is derived for each form of diversity, assuming that each diversity branch is independent of the others and subject to fading with a Rayleigh envelope distribution. Curves of average SNR plotted against the mean CNR in one branch are presented for various numbers of diversity branches and ratios of IF bandwidth and baseband bandwidth. The curves presented are for maximal-ratio combining only, but it is shown that the results for selection diversity and equal-gain combining may be obtained from these curves by simply applying a correction to the mean CNR. The theoretical results are supported by experimental measurements that show very close agreement with theory."
"The S/N loss due to amplitude quantization is examined in connection with a digital matched filter correlator for a binary coded signal. A minimax binary quantizing concept is described, which adds an optimized noise dither prior to hard clipping. The design philosophy is minimax; i.e., the loss from an ideal analog correlator is minimized in the presence of the worst interference constrained to a specified average power. The resulting worst performance degradation is 4.8 dB, and occurs for constant amplitude interference. The extension of the minimax approach to a multilevel randomized quantizing concept is sketched. With four-level quantization, an upper bound on the performance degradation is 2.3 dB. The effect of finite time estimation of the interference power is determined, with the conclusion that a short-term power averaging can be used with only a small additional loss. Computer simulation results are in accordance with theoretical predictions."
"The constraints of digital satellite communications systems have led to the derivation of a method for resolving the problem of recovered-carrier phase ambiguity in a coherent fourphase phase-shift-keying (PSK) communications system while simultaneously providing synchronization information. This method is described for the general case and a general implementation is given. In addition, implementations are given for two particularly simple special cases."
"Phase-locked loops (PLL) with pulse-type (sawtooth) phase comparators find many applications in digital transmission systems. In this paper, the results available on the pull-in performance of the second-order PLL with sawtooth phase comparator are summarized. Then a generalized phase comparator, called a phase-and-frequency comparator, is shown to improve PLL acquisition performance significantly. Several circuit implementations are discussed in detail."
"Suppose that a random variable has the probability density functionp_{v,\\sigma}(x) = \\frac{\\upsilon}{\\sigma\\Gamma(1/\\upsilon)}exp [-(x/\\sigma)^{\\upsilon}],0 \\leq x \\leq \\inftywhere σ and ν may not be known. In order to estimate the probabilityP_{e}(K)that the random variable exceeds a high thresholdK, an extrapolation can be made from counting estimates\\hat{P}_{e}(x_{1}),\\hat{P}_{e}(x_{2}), ... ,\\hat{P}_{e}(x_{m}), of the probabilities of exceedingmlower thresholds. Using the observation that a double logarithmic function ofP_{e}(x), is approximately linear in log(x)for a useful range of the exponent, an estimate of In [-InP_{e}f(K)] can be made by straightline extrapolation. In application to estimation of error rate in a digital communication system operating over an analog channel, only weak a-priori assumptions about the noise need be made, substantially fewer samples are required than for the usual counting estimate, and knowledge of the transmitted data sequence is unnecessary. A physical implementation of this technique in an error meter is described."
"This paper presents an analysis, simulation, and discussion of the effects of communication errors on four-bit differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) sampled imagery. Simulations are presented that describe the effects of inserting periodic \"PCM updates\" in order to correct communication errors in the DPCM transmission of photographic scenes that have been scanned and sampled at the Nyquist rate."
"In keeping with the trend to greater use of digital circuits for signal processing, a project was undertaken to realize in an exploratory way an important telecommunication function using as great a proportion of digital hardware as possible. The function chosen is that of theA-channel bank; viz., the frequency division multiplexing (FDM) of 12 voiceband signals onto a single wire. Because of the nature of its operation the device to be described can also perform a translation between FDM analog signals and time division multiplexed (TDM) digital signals. This paper describes the overall system design of the device with particular emphasis on a noise analysis. The principal sources of noise are the A/D conversion points and the roundoff points that occur at the outputs of multipliers. Each noise source is examined in turn and its contribution to the total noise assessed. It is concluded that the A/D conversion points are the most important noise sources and the most costly to deal with."
"An experimental model of a coder for transmission of speech over a 9600-bits/s digital channel was built to demonstrate feasibility of an adaptive prediction-coding technique. After analog-to-digital conversion of the speech input, the coder employs digital processing using a computer type organization. Resonances in the short-term speech spectrum are removed by a nonrecursive digital transmit filter and the resulting uncorrelated signal is coded by an 8000-bits/s direct feedback delta coder. The transmit filter parameters are adapted to the input spectrum by a least squares algorithm involving calculation of short term correlation coefficients of the sequence of input samples. These filter parameters are multiplexed with the delta coder output for transmission to the receiver. A recursive receive filter restores the original speech spectrum. A computer simulation of the voice digitizer was performed to determine the order of the digital filters and to optimize other parameters prior to the design of the experimental model. The results of the simulation and design considerations for the experimental model are described."
"When speech is transmitted over a conventional pulsecode modulation carrier the connection between two subscribers on a digital basis is straightforward. However, techniques for digital conference arrangements are not well known. Implementation of a conference arrangement using traditional analog techniques requires elaborate hardware and use of analog-to-digital converters. This paper, after a brief discussion of existing conference arrangements, describes an instant speaker algorithm and the digital circuitry employed to implement this algorithm. During every time frame an \"active speaker\" sample is sought. The active speaker is identified by comparing each participant's digital sample during the following time frame. The active speaker sample is transmitted to all participants in the conferencing arrangement. A \"last speaker\" sample is transmitted to the active speaker. The conference circuit consists of 3 modules: comparison and gating module, active speaker memory module, and last speaker memory module. The implementation of these modules with conventional transistor-transistor logic digital circuits is discussed. Overall arrangement of this conference circuit in a local digital exchange is also explored. Some comments are made concerning \"on-off\" patterns found in normal conversation and their relationship to the instant speaker algorithm."
"The details of the partitioning of a digital filter for integrated-circuit realization are discussed. It is shown that the fourth-order filtering requirement of an all digital channel bank serving 24 channels may be implemented with 40 integrated-circuit chips."
"During the past few years several monochromeimage transform-coding systems have been developed. In these systems, a quantized and coded version of a spatial unitary transform of an image is transmitted over a channel, rather than an image itself. In this paper the transform-coding concept has been applied to the coding of color images represented by three primary color planes of data. The principles of spatial transform coding are reviewed and the merits of various methods of color-image representation are discussed. A performance analysis is presented for the color-image transform-coding system. Results of a computer simulation of the coding system are also given. It is shown that, by transform coding, the chrominance content of a color image can be coded with an average of 1.0 bits per element or less without serious degradation. If luminance coding is also employed, the average rate reduces to about 2.0 bits per element or less."
"In this survey we shall review coding techniques and results which pertain to such problems as reduction of dc wandering, suppression of intersymbol interference, and inclusion of selfclocking capability. These problems are of engineering interest in the transmission or recording of digital data. The topics to be discussed include: 1) dc free codes such as bipolar signals and feedback balanced codes, 2) correlative level codes and optimal decoding methods, 3) Fibonacci codes and run-length constraint codes, and 4) state-oriented codes."
"A study of the statistics of a differential pulse-code modulation coder for Picturephone® signals which uses a three-bit uniform length code suggests that a higher transmission efficiency can be obtained with a variable word length code. This permits an increase in number of quantizing levels used, thus improving picture quality. A quantizer with 24 levels rather than eight can be used provided that a buffer store of 10 000 bits is included in the system to smooth the irregular data flow caused by the varying code word length."
"Advances in several areas of speech communication research are discussed. Areas selected for comment include: 1) digital encoding and transmission of speech; 2) computer synthesis of speech; 3) automatic speaker verification; 4) speech production; 5) speech perception; and 6) interactive design of digital filters. Advances in these areas have been facilitated by two important tools: a) the growing theory of sampled-data systems and b) the general availability of modest-size, fast digital computers. For each area, specific research examples are chosen to represent current activity. Also, the examples are chosen to emphasize the advantages of digital formulation of the problems and to show how one particular laboratory computer facility is used for interactive studies in speech communication."
"This work analyzes the operation of a dithered quantizer of picture luminance. It is shown that the addition of dither before quantization restores some of the pictorial information which a coarse quantizer would otherwise discard. Two-dimensional ordered dither patterns are described which are considerably more effective for this purpose than random distributions of the same dither samples. The patterns of dither can also be designed so that noise artifacts on the output picture are less visible than with equivalent random dither and so that (contrary to the random case) it is not necessary to subtract the same dither pattern at the receiver for substantially best results."
"The decision process in source encoders can be influenced favorably by anticipating future quantizing errors and modifying the quantizer appropriately. This requires that the signal code be delayed slightly from the corresponding input signal sample. As an adaptation of an existing coder, little advantage is obtained [8]. However, the process has a stabilizing influence so that much stronger adaptation algorithms can be used to advantage, increasing the signal to quantizing noise ratio(S/N)markedly. It is believed that this fact is of general applicability, but it is shown herein only for 1-bit coders. A family of 1-bit coders (delta modulators) using exponentially adaptive step size, with two steps of integration in the feedback path has been studied using a special purpose computer facility. Such coders are ordinarily unstable and useless, but with error anticipation a measuredS/Nadvantage of several dB over optimized adaptive coders of previous design is obtained. The study has concentrated on picture signals and an encoding which does not require a separate channel or code to signal changes in the coder. Fig. 8 compares the optimized delayed encoder operation with an optimized adaptive coder without delay. \"Optimization\" in the former case requires a modification of the feedback network-the use of two steps of integration instead of one. Delayed encoding is not just an improvement for existing differential coders, it promises to be a revolution in coder design."
"A modified 3-bit per sample differential PCM coder that is subjectively comparable to a 10-level differential PCM coder is described. The accuracy of coding the signals preceding and following large signal changes is restricted. The bits thus saved are used to improve the coding accuracy of large signal changes. No visible impairments are introduced by this process. The changes in coding strategy are carried in the main signal stream to the receiver and do not require flags or buffer memory. The coder's algorithm, implementation, and subjective results are described."
"Two important classes of coding schemes that use the spatial correlation of picture elements in reducing data redundancy are the differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) and the unitary transform coding techniques. We will study the performance of annth order DPCM system fornranging from 1 to 22 and compare it to the performance of the unitary-transform techniques (Hadamard, Fourier, and KarhunenLoève) in coding two monochrome still pictures. We will also consider the sensitivities of the coding systems to picture-to-picture variations."
"Discrete forms of the Fourier, Hadamard, and Karhunen-Loève transforms are examined for their capacity to reduce the bit rate necessary to transmit speech signals. To rate their effectiveness in accomplishing this goal the quantizing error (or noise) resulting for each transformation method at various bit rates is computed and compared with that for conventional companded PCM processing. Based on this comparison, it is found that Karhunen-Loève provides a reduction in bit rate of 13.5 kbits/s, Fourier 10 kbits/s, and Hadamard 7.5 kbits/s as compared with the bit rate required for companded PCM. These bit-rate reductions are shown to be somewhat independent of the transmission bit rate."
"Amplitude clipping of PCM signals consisting of superimposed sine and cosine pulses allows a signal power increase compared to time division of 4 to 10 dB, depending on the activity actor, in peak limited multichannel systems."
"In this paper a useful and mathematically rigorous method is presented for exactly evaluating the error-probability performance of a binary differentially coherent phase-shift-keyed (DPSK) system in the presence of both thermal noise and intersymbol interference. The channel filter and the receiver input signal-to-noise ratio are assumed to be given. This method suggests, first, to calculate the probability of error induced by both the thermal noise and the large interfering samples whose normalized amplitudes with respect to noise standard deviation are greater than unity, and then, to add the correction terms due to the presence of the other intersymbol interference samples. If the normalized interference amplitudes with respect to the noise standard deviation are less than unity (although the total interference power may still be greater than total noise power), then this method simply becomes that which first evaluates the error probability induced by thermal noise alone and then adds the correction terms due to the presence of intersymbol interference. For numerical computations, various recurrence relations are developed so that the probability of error can be easily obtained on a digital computer. These relations have been utilized in an example to calculate the performance of certain practical PSK and DPSK systems."
"Segment companding laws are being used in PCM channel banks to permit more efficient signal processing on a digital basis. A unified formulation of these companding laws is used as a basis for the systematic synthesis of digital attenuators operating directly on the compressed code. Simple sequential circuits for digital attenuation are derived from expansion and compression algorithms. Signal-to-noise ratio, idle-circuit noise, and attenuation actually achieved are calculated."
"Terminal analog or formant speech synthesizers have found many applications in speech research. These include investigation of computer voice response, speech synthesis-by-rule, and speech perception studies, among others. Many types of formant synthesizers have been designed and realized either in analog circuitry or as a computer program. In this paper we describe a digital hardware realization of a formant synthesizer which utilizes the technique of digital multiplexing of a single arithmetic unit among several digital filter sections. The advantages of this hardware over conventional analog hardware include: precise control over center frequencies and bandwidths of the resonators in the synthesizer, stability and reliability of the hardware, light weight, small size, and low power consumption. The synthesizer is capable of producing speech in real time at sampling rates up to 12.8 kHz, using 24 bits to process the digital signals internal to the synthesizer. A 12-bit digital-to-analog convertor supplies an immediate analog output for monitoring the speech and a provision is included for returning 16 bits of the output signal to the computer for future processing such as waveform display or spectrum analysis."
"In the transmission of color television signals over a digital communications system, the analog TV signal must first be converted to digital form. This paper treats the first step in this conversion, sampling of the analog waveform. A significant reduction in sampling rate can be achieved by using several properties of the television signal. The spectrum of the TV signal has the energy concentrated at harmonics of the line and field rates. By choosing a sampling rate that is less than twice the bandwidth and a frequency that is an odd multiple of one-half the line rate, the aliased energy resulting from the sampling process falls in the gaps of the video signal energy. A comb filter is then used to remove most of the aliased energy. The resulting signal shows no appreciable deterioration. The subjective effects of noise added between harmonics of the line rate are discussed. These results are used to determine the requirements of the comb filter. The key parameters of one form of a comb filter are developed. A quantitative evaluation of the comb filter parameters shows that adequate suppression of the aliased energy can be achieved."
"A theoretical analysis is presented of the tolerance to additive Gaussian noise of an adaptive data transmission system operating over a transmission path whose impulse response may vary slowly and over a wide range. Different detection processes and various transmitter and receiver filter characteristics are considered. The transmitted signal elements are separated into groups, with a sufficient time gap between adjacent groups to keep them orthogonal at the detector input. This paper is concerned with the performance of the detector when correctly matched to the channel. The adaptive techniques required to hold the detector in this condition have been described elsewhere and are not considered here. It is shown that the best of the detection processes achieves a good tolerance to additive noise, even in the presence of severe signal distortion, and that this detector is ideally suited for use with transmitter and receiver filters which introduce considerable intersymbol interference."
"A system is presented for reducing the number of picture elements in a scanned image by an order of magnitude while preserving the detail contrast. Starting with high-resolution data a 3 × 3 matrix of input elements is compressed into a single output element using a nonlinear algorithm. Optimum results are obtained by including the data on the outer periphery of the input sample in the processing algorithm thus requiring a 5 × 5 input matrix. Experimental results are presented using weather satellite photographs. This system has application in those cases where the sensor has higher resolution capability than the communication link can support."
"A maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) approach is used to derive the optimal equalizer for binary signals transmitted at a constant rate over a dispersive and noisy channel. The optimal equalizer is shown to consist of a matched filter followed by a very complex nonlinear transversal filter. Various approximations are made to simplify the transversal filter. Thus the optimal linear equalizer and two suboptimal nonlinear equalizers are obtained. The performance characteristics of these equalizers are compared in terms of eye patterns and error probabilities. These investigations exhibit a clear superiority of the nonlinear equalizers. Up to a certain peak distortion, intersymbol interference can be eliminated by nonlinear equalization With negligible noise enhancement. The error probability then closely approaches the error probability in the case of noninterfering signals."
"Consideration is given to the use of the discrete Kalman filter as an equalizer for digital binary transmission in the presence of noise and intersymbol interference. When the channel is modeled as ann-tap transversal filter, the Kalman filter assumes a similar form with \"feed forward and feedback.\" It is shown how the Kalman filter can be used to estimate both the tap weights and the binary signal. Computer results on a fixed 6-tap channel show that use of the 6-tap Kalman filter yields a considerably smaller error probability than when a conventional transversal equalizer with 15 taps is used. Limited computer studies on the same channel, assumed to be initially unknown, suggest that the Kalman filter is capable of converging rapidly in the adaptive mode. Though these results are very encouraging, much work remains in the study and optimization of performance in the adaptive mode."
"Buffer stores are needed at both sender and receiver whenever a real-time signal is coded into a varying rate sequence of digits and these are transmitted over a channel at a uniform rate. Practical sending stores must be finite in size and therefore are subject to overflow; they thus function in a transient mode. In this paper, deterministic constraints on the operation of sending and receiving stores are established and their sizes are related to bittransmission rate and storage delay. The random behavior of the sending store is modeled as a first-order Markov chain with an absorbing state (overflow). The study is motivated by the case of nonuniformly coded differential PCM television signals. Some simulator measurements are reported on the actual incidence of overflows with such signals when using small-capacity stores (<120-bit storage). The Markov model for these cases is seen to give correct trends, although overall the measurements reveal considerably greater incidences of overflow. It can be expected, however, that the agreement between model and measurement would improve with size of stores."
"A new source encoder called the adaptive block quantizer is proposed for coding data sources that emit a sequence of correlated real numbers with known first- and second-order statistics, Blocks of source output symbols are first classified and then block quantized in a manner that depends on their classification. The system is optimized relative to both the mean square error and the subjective quality of the reconstructed data for a certain class of pictorial data, and the resulting system performance demonstrated. Some interesting relationships between mean square error and subjective picture quality are presented."
"An adaptive variable length coding system is presented. Although developed primarily for the proposed Grand Tour missions, many features of this system clearly indicate a much wider applicability. Using sample to sample prediction, the coding system produces output rates within 0.25 bit/picture element (pixel) of the onedimensional difference entropy for entropy values ranging from 0 to 8 bit/pixel. This is accomplished without the necessity of storing any code words. Performance improvements of 0.5 bit/pixel can be simply achieved by utilizing previous line correlation. A Basic Compressor, using concatenated codes, adapts to rapid changes in source statistics by automatically selecting one of three codes to use for each block of 21 pixels. The system adapts to less frequent, but more dramatic, changes in source statistics by adjusting the mode in which the Basic Compressor operates on a line-to-line basis. Furthermore, the compression system is independent of the quantization requirements of the pulse-code modulation system."
"A video codec is described that encodes a 1-MHz analog Picturephone® signal into a 6.312-Mbit/s digital form, suitable for transmission on the Bell System T2 digital facility. Through efficient coding of the horizontal sync format, the bulk of the horizontal blanking period is available for sending active video information. The signal is differentially encoded into 4 bits per sample with a quantizer whose levels are spaced nonlinearly. Excess bits are stored in a small buffer to be transmitted during the time made available in the blanking region. The nonlinear quantizer characteristics are subjectively matched to visual processes to minimize the viewer's sensitivity to coding inaccuracies for a broad range of pictures. All the necessary automatic maintenance and alarm functions required for a digitally switched network are included in the codec design."
"An experimental and computer investigation of a 9-bit, 16-MHz binary rate multiplier (BRM) used in converting digital signals differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) to analog signals (voice) is reported in this paper. The physical electronic circuitry was provided with a stream of real-time digital samples at a 32-kHz rate from a magnetic tape which had been generated by a computer simulation. The output power spectrum of the electronic circuit was observed and compared to that of the computer calculation. Before exciting the experimental circuit with the digital samples the circuit noise in absence of signal was measured at - 11 decibels above a reference noise using a C message weighting filter (dBrnC0). Three different input signals were used to probe the BRM. Two consisted of single sine waves at various levels and in one test ten arbitrary phase superimposed sine waves were used to simulate white noise. Experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement and together demonstrate that the BRM approach is a viable technique for digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion."

 "An example is used to show why some solutions to singular optimal control problems satisfy the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition, but violate Jacobson's necessary condition. This example also demonstrates that Jacobson's condition may help in establishing if and when switching from a singular to a nonsingular subarc occurs in some problems."
"Equations analogous to the Lyapunov matrix equation are derived for second-ordern-dimensional systems. These are shown to be more readily solvable than the equivalent2n-dimensional Lyapunov matrix equation."
"Kalman gave a set of recursive equations for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system. However, the Kalman filter requires a knowledge of all the system and noise parameters. Here it is assumed that all these parameters are unknown and therefore must be identified before use in the Kalman filter. A correlation technique which identifies a system in its canonical form is presented. The estimates are shown to be asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent. The scheme is capable of being implemented on-line and can be used in conjunction with the Kalman filter. A technique for more efficient estimation by using higher order correlations is also given. A recursive technique is given to determine the order of the system when the dimension of the system is unknown. The results are first derived for stationary processes and are then extended to nonstationary processes which are stationary in theqth increment. An application of the results to a practical problem is presented."
"Some properties of nonzero-sum differential games are explored. A differential game is defined in extensive form, and the set of attainable payoffsPis defined. Various subsets ofPwhich are useful in discussing solutions are identified. The concept of signaling in discrete games is interpreted as dynamic bargaining in continuously evolving games. Via these concepts a player can, at little expense to himself, attempt to induce the other players to adopt a strategy more favorable to himself. Several examples are given to illustrate the definitions and developments. Interpreting some classical matrix games as continuously evolving games helps to clarify that there can be cooperation or threatening without pregame or explicit negotiation and bargaining. A simple two-player differential game which has been programmed on a hybrid computer and for which some limited experimental results are presented is also described."
"A sampled-data composite system given by a set of vector difference equationsx_{i}(\\tau + 1) - x_{i}(\\tau) = \\sum \\min{j = 1} \\max{n} A_{ij} f_{j}[x_{j}(\\tau)], i = 1 ..., nis dealt with. The system given byx_{i}(\\tau + 1) - x_{i}(\\tau) = A_{ij} f_{i}[x_{i}(\\tau)]is referred to as theith isolated subsystem. It is shown that the composite system is asymptotically stable in the large if the fisatisfy certain conditions and the leading principal minors of the determinant|b_{ij}|, i,j = 1, ..., n,are all positive. Here, the diagonal element biiis a positive number such that\\|x_{i}(\\tau + 1)\\| - \\|x_{i}(\\tau) \\| \\leq - b_{ij}\\| f_{i}[x_{i}(\\tau)]\\|holds with regard to the motion of theith isolated subsystem, and the nondiagonal elementb_{ij} , i \\neq j, is the minus of\\|A_{ij}\\|, which is defined as the maximum of\\|A_{ij}x_{j}\\|, for\\|x_{j}\\| = 1. Some extensions of this result are also given. Composite relay controlled systems are studied as examples."
"A Lyapunov-like approach to the controllability of nonlinear dynamic systems is presented. A theory is developed which yields sufficient conditions for complete controllability for some classes of nonlinear systems; feedback controllers which drive the systems to desired terminal conditions, at a specified final time, are also obtained. Well-known controllability conditions for linear dynamic systems are derived using this general controllability theory. Elliptical regions are found which contain (bound) the trajectories of a class of systems controlled according to these methods. These regions are used in synthesizing controllers for nonlinear systems and for a class of state-variable inequality constrained problems. An uncontrollability theorem, based also upon Lyapunov-like notions, is presented; this yields sufficiency conditions for uncontrollability for some types of nonlinear systems. Relationships of the theories to other nonlinear controllability approaches are indicated."
"A graphical technique for determining the existence of limit cycles, their amplitude, frequency, and stability when they exist, and the stability of a single-loop feedback system withn - 1memoryless nonlinear elements and one nonlinear element with memory is considered. The approach here is to assume an input to a nonlinear element and then apply the Nyquist stability condition to the linear system resulting after the nonlinear elements have been approximated by their describing functions. The method requires no trial and error procedure, is noniterative in nature, and is especially easy to apply. The method is subject to the usual errors and restrictions of the describing function method. An extension of the method to includennon-linear elements with memory andnnonlinear elements in parallel is also included. Three numerical examples are included to illustrate the method."
"A method is presented which permits the solution of singular control problems by approximating the nonnormal system with a normal system. It is shown that the approximation can be made arbitrarily accurate. The optimal control of the approximate system is then determined and applied to the actual system. Bounds are obtained on the errors in boundary conditions and the degree of suboptimality brought about by the technique. The method is valid for minimum time and minimum fuel problems with linear constant plants. Examples are presented."
"A method for nonlinear system design based on the generalized Popov stability criterion is developed. It is shown that although the design method is applicable for all values ofqin the Popov theory, it is particularly useful whenqis nonzero since it greatly simplifies the design effort for this case. All designs are accomplished in conjunction with the Nyquist and modified Nyquist loci. Basic to the design procedure is the development and utilization of the modified frequency-response polar loci for lag and lead compensation networks. An example is included to illustrate the procedure described."
"The minimality of the Wilkie-Perkins low-order sensitivity model [1] for multi-input systems is reexamined. An example is offered to provide insight into the optimality discussion of Guardabassi et al. [2]. Then it is indicated that generation of sensitivity functions of arbitrary multi-input systems requires at mostm . nintegrators in addition to the system model."
"The synthesis of a suboptimal feedback control law for second-order nonlinear systems with a quadratic performance index is considered. The synthesis methods developed for this problem generally consist of different ways for determining the coefficients of a power series which approximates the optimal control laws. A method using piecewise-linear functions is described."
"Some points which have arisen in the author's attempts to teach Kirchner's method of computing eAt, whereAis a real square matrix, to a class of undergraduate engineering students are discussed. These points include 1) how to avoid the one matrix inversion required, 2) how to handle pairs of complex eigenvalues, and 3) simplifications in the important case in which the eigenvalues are distinct."
"An approximateSplane is derived from theWplane for analyzing sampled-data systems. Constant frequency and constant damping-ratio loci are first mapped onto theWplane. A simple transformation of theW-plane coordinates toS-plane coordinates is then constructed, and sampling frequency boundaries are specified wherein interpretation in theWplane becomes identical to that in theSplane. HenceS-plane results can be obtained quickly for those system frequencies within the specified boundaries."
"In many important tactical situations, an attacking vehicle is guided toward a selected target by means of a control law selected to optimize a quadratic performance index. When this occurs, the tracking observer may take this intelligence into account and realize improvement in both the tracking accuracy and an estimate of the attacker's ultimate destination. An evaluation is given of Luenberger's proposed solution to problems of this type by determining for a missile analogy example the sensitivity of tracking performance to the tracker's knowledge of the attacker's intelligence parameters and by comparing the performance obtained using the proposed method with that provided by more conventional approaches that do not utilize a priori intelligence information. Conclusions regarding the practical implementation of the new approach are then drawn."

"Give a consistent set ofmlinear equations innunknown variables, a minimum-effort solution is defined to be a solution of that set of equations whose maximum component's magnitude is the smallest possible. An algorithmic procedure for obtaining a minimum-effort solution is developed. Its development is based on the duality principle from functional analysis. Possible applications of such an algorithm for typical digital control problems is presented in the introductory section. In such situations, it is frequently desirable to effect a given control task while using minimum control amplitude."

It is known that the problem statement is redundant, in that distinct matrices Q1and Q2can yield the same feedback lawK. Such matrices are called equivalent, and a simple test for equivalence is available for the single-input case. This note generalizes the test to the multivariable case."
"The classical problem of parameter selection of three-term controllers within the framework of suboptimal linear regulator theory is viewed. Iterative techniques are used to determine the controller parameters so that the expected value of a quadratic loss type performance index is minimized, with the initial states of the system a random variable uniformly distributed over a unit sphere."

"The use of signal stabilization as a means of stabilizing non-linear systems has been known for a long time. Very recently, the method of obtaining the minimum amplitude of dither signal for a relay type nonlinear system was also established. An empirical relationship for the minimum amplitude of dither required for quenching the limit cycles in a nonlinear system with a relay with hysteresis type nonlinearity is obtained."

 "A simple algorithm is presented by which uncontrollable (observable) states can be removed from the given state equations for linear time-varying systems. The algorithm is an extension of the technique given by Mayne [1] for linear time-invariant systems and makes use of time-variable controllability and observability matrices. It appears to be simpler than the existing methods [3]-[5]."
"A numerical method is derived to determine the zeros of transfer functions relating any two variables or set of variables of single-variable or multivariable control systems.

"A given curve is approximated by a sequence of arcs pieced together continuously in such a way that each arc satisfies a linear differential equation of a general type with input vector constant in each interval. A computer algorithm based on a modified version of the discrete maximum principle for the optimal determination of the switching points and input vectors is outlined."
"Two aspects of the theory of exponential representation for the solution of linear differential equation systems are investigated. The first result for (2; 2)-order systems develops a relationship between the exponents of the system representation and a solution of an appropriately defined Riccati equation. A similar result is known for classical representations, thus providing a direct connection between the two theories. Second, as a collateral result, it is shown that the global invertibility of the defining exponential relationships does not necessarily imply that the representation is global."
"A theorem recently proposed by Davison [1] on pole assignment with incomplete state feedback is extended to noncyclic matrices by using the results of Brasch and Pearson [2].

  "Two classes of nonlinear dynamical systems driven by independent noise on which linear discrete-time scalar measurements are performed also in the presence of additive independent noise are considered. The evolution operators for these classes are described, respectively, by algebraic and trigonometric polynomials in the state variables.

On the assumption that certain moments of the noise sources are known, a framework is developed which leads to convergent stochastic approximation algorithms for the identification of system parameters."

"The linear filtering, prediction, and smoothing problems are treated for linear message processes with state-dependent noise and time-correlated measurement noise. In particular, a general smoothing formula for these classes of message processes is developed. The derivation evolves directly from the Wiener-Hopf equation and does not use the innovations process."

"In the above correspondence,[1] Walter clarified the scaling required for validity of a certain formula for the inverse of the eigenvector matrix of a Hamiltonian matrix [1], [2]. It was further stated that this scaling must be performed to make valid recently published expressions for the time-varying solution of the matrix Riccati equation [1]. It is shown in this correspondence that the validity of the expressions for the time-varying solution of the matrix Riccati equation does not depend upon the scaling of the eigenvectors."
"The theory of state-variable feedback decoupling in multivariable control systems is generalized to include the case where a subset of the output set is the candidate for decoupling. Systems in which such decoupling is employed will be termed \"partially decoupled.\" Decoupling a selected set of outputs, when achieved by using a state feedback matrixFand a nousingular (m \\times m) input matrixG, will be calledm-input decoupling (MID), to reflect the restriction on the input matrix. An algorithm, developed by Silverman for constructing inverse systems, is shown to play an essential role in the MID problem, and using matrices constructed in the algorithm, necessary, and sufficient conditions form-input decoupling the specified set of outputs are obtained. As would be expected, these necessary and sufficient conditions include the existing conditions for decoupling all system outputs as a special case. An example is given illustrating the results."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of estimating the state of a linear dynamic system using noise-corrupted observations, when input disturbances and observation errors are unknown except for the fact that they belong to given bounded sets. The cases of both energy constraints and individual instantaneous constraints for the uncertain quantities are considereal. In the former case, the set of possible system states compatible with the observations received is shown to be an ellipsoid, and equations for its center and weighting matrix are given, while in the latter case, equations describing a bounding ellipsoid to the set of possible states are derived. All three problems of filtering, prediction, and smoothing are examined by relating them to standard tracking problems of optimal control theory. The resulting estimators are similar in structure and comparable in simplicity to the corresponding stochastic linear minimum-variance estimators, and it is shown that they provide distinct advantages over existing schemes for recursive estimation with a set-membership description of uncertainty."
"Sequential estimation of the states of several high-order interconnected systems may be prohibitive on computer time and storage if the problem is formulated as for a single system. Therefore, multilevel systems theory has been applied to derive a coordination algorithm, with one-step convergence, for a number of subsystem Kalman estimators. The procedure may be computationally attractive for sparsely coupled subsystems with few stochastic inputs."
"In a family of nonlinear optimal control problems, equivalence classes of problems that yield identical optimal closed-loop systems are delineated. The equivalence relations are established as one-to-one correspondences between the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations associated with the problems. Two such equivalence relations are presented. These allow an arbitrary problem in the family to be reduced to an equivalent basic standard form of problem. Also, a new formal procedure for solving this basic problem is given that allows the determination of coefficients in the series expansion of the optimal closed-loop system. The set of algebraic equations to be solved is considerably simpler than that derived by other methods."
"Design of optimal control systems with reduced sensitivity to parameter variations is attempted by employing trajectory sensitivity feedback and minimizing a cost term that includes the trajectory sensitivity. Since the trajectory, sensitivity, cannot be assessed directly, a successive approximation method that results in \"near\" sensitivity feedback is given for the case of linear regulators. The method may be extended to more general optimal control problems."
"The problem of simultaneously determining an optimal control strategy and an optimal observation strategy for a linear system is considered. Quadratic costs on state and control and an \"on-off\" type observation cost are assumed. Dynamic programming is used to obtain a solution. An example is provided that shows some interesting relations between the optimal observation strategy and various system parameters."
"System decoupling by state variable feedback is demonstrated for the time-variable case. Conditions under which decoupling is possible are formulated and the matrices effecting decoupling are given. The inverse of a general time-variable multivariable system is also determined. By applying this inverse a new synthesis method is developed."
"A method for reducing the order of a linear time-invariant dynamic system is presented. It is shown that it is possible to retain the predominant eigenvalues (or any other set of eigenvalues) of the exact system in the lower order model that possesses the property that its state is an aggregation of the state variables of the original system. Also it is shown that the output of the reduced order model can be constrained to contain all the modes of the exact output and to be close to the actual output of the original system within a specified tolerance. The performance of the original system is investigated for an optimal output regulator problem, when it is controlled on the assumption that its behavior is governed by that of the lower order model. Relations are obtained for the performance degradation that results with the above suboptimal control policy. Numerical examples show that the suboptimal control can be used in practice to lessen the computational complexity required for the higher order optimal control. The stability of the suboptimal control is not guaranteed; however, it is reasonable to expect it to be asymptotically stable when the order of reduction is not excessively high, because the outputs of the exact and lower order models are tolerably close."
"Some results of a physiological investigation of the sampling hypothesis in the human motor control system are presented in this paper. The hypothesis of a proprioceptively open loop system at the initiation of voluntary effort is not supported by data from ankle rotation. No discontinuity in the monosynaptic pathway (primary afferent fiber to alpha motoneuron) is observed during random isometric step tracking using theHreflex as test signal in the gastrocnemius-soleus reflex arc. This would indicate that for the ankle control system, the hypothesis of sampling at the alpha motoneuron, as proposed by Navas and Stark for wrist rotation, is not valid. The sampling behavior in the human motor system, if it exists, must be of the central origin."
"Systems described by parabolic partial differential equations are formulated as ordinary differential equations in a Hilbert space. Quadratic cost criteria are then formulated as inner products on this Hilbert space. Existence of an optimal control is proved both in the case where the system operator is \"coercive\" and in the case where the system operator is the infinitesimal generator of a semigroup of operators. The optimal control is given by a linear state feedback law in which the feedback operator is shown to be the bounded positive self-adjoint solution of a nonlinear operator equation of the Riccati type."
"In this paperk-player nonzero sum differential games are considered. A necessary condition for the closed-loop Nash equilibrium solution to be noninferior is presented. This condition involves the rank of a matrix made up of the first partial derivatives of thekHamiltonians. This condition is also a sufficient condition for the existence of a solution with the property that if the players use this solution each player does at least as well as when the Nash solutions are used and at least one player does better."
"Optimal structure and parameter adaptive estimators have been obtained for continuous as well as discrete data Gaussian process models with linear dynamics. Specifically, the essentially nonlinear adaptive estimators are shown to be decomposable (partition theorem) into two parts, a linear nonadaptive part consisting of a bank of Kalman-Bucy filters and a nonlinear part that incorporates the adaptive nature of the estimator. The conditional-error-covariance matrix of the estimator is also obtained in a form suitable for on-line performance evaluation. The adaptive estimators are applied to the problem of state estimation with non-Gaussian initial state, to estimation under measurement uncertainty (joint detection-estimation) as well as to system identification. Examples are given of the application of the adaptive estimators to structure and parameter adaptation indicating their applicability to engineering problems."
"In the control of multi-input plants, the optimal choice of the feedback control inputs depends upon the choice of disturbance inputs by the competitor, enemy, or nature. Under that viewpoint, the formulation of the control problem under conflict of interest is translated to a differential game. This study considers a two-person conflicting situation, described by linear plant dynamics, while the performance indices are quadratic functionals. A theorem and an iterative numerical technique, based on Newton's method, are developed, for the actual computation of the closed-loop solution in the stationary case of the nonzero and zero-sum differential game. Explicit solutions are also presented for the finite terminal time problem arising in the zero-sum linear differential game, and a simple sufficient condition for the existence of such solutions is included. Two examples are solved to illustrate the procedures described."

"The homogeneous solution (i.e., state transition matrix) to the general linear time varying system is shown to be a matrix power series generated by a time-varying matrix-differential operator operating recursively and noncommutatively on the identity matrix. The particular solution is shown to be a similar series generated by the same matrix operator operating recursively and noncommutatively on the time-varying vector-forcing function. The reduction to the time-invariant case is direct."
"An efficient algorithm for the computation of the integral of the state transition matrix over the interval [0, T_{1}] is developed, It is assumed that there exists someT < T_{1}such that the state transition matrix and the integral of the state transition matrix can be computed as accurately as required over the interval [0, T]."
"It is shown that a causal linear system with an equal number of inputs and outputs can be made to be simultaneously invertible and output reproducible by employing a feedforward loop. This feed-forward loop does not affect the stability, of the system one way or the other."
"The controllability and observability of linear stationary multivariable control systems is investigated in the frequency domain.

"Leth(x, t)be a polynomial with complex coefficients in the two complex variableszandt. Pontryagin[1] has developed necessary and sufficient conditions that the functionH(z) = h(z, e^{z})have zeros with only negative real parts. The usual case in a stability analysis of a feedback system is to be given a ratio of such polynomials for the open-loop case, and to find right-half plane (rhp) zeros of the denominator of the closed-loop gain. In this letter an attempt is made to extend the Pontryagin criterion to the open-loop closed-loop type of analysis. While some interesting results are obtained, it is concluded that this is not a fruitful area of research."

In the present paper, we show how to extend this technique to the nonlinear estimation (filtering and smoothing) of non-Gaussian signals in additive white Gaussian noise. The use of the innovations allows us to obtain formulas and simple derivations that are remarkably similar to those used for the linear case thereby distinguishing clearly the essential points at which the nonlinear problem differs from the linear one."

"When the additive noise vector in the discrete observation process of a system can be partitioned into uncorrelated subvectors, an iterative processing technique for updating the Kalman-filter covariance matrix can often be used to increase computational efficiency. For standard typical programming algorithms and for a typical computer, the iterative processing technique can theoretically reduce the computational requirements of the covariance updating equation by over 50 percent. In practical situations, computational savings of over 30 percent are realizable, a significant amount particularly for real-time tracking applications in high-target-density environments. Furthermore, independent of the computational advantages, the iterative processing technique is useful for track management, permitting effective utilization of priority and interrupt schemes without disturbing the Kalman-filter operation."

"In this paper a formal definition of \"inners\" of a square matrix is introduced. Also defined are the concepts of positive, negative, null, and nonnull innerwise matrix. Applications of these definitions are shown 1) for the necessary and sufficient conditions for the roots of a real polynomial to be within the unit circle, 2) for the roots of a real polynomial to be distinct and on the real axis, and 3) to be distinct and on the imaginary axis in the complex plane. Conditions on relative stability of linear continuous systems as well as on root distribution within the unit circle are also presented in terms of inners. Furthermore, a theorem establishing the equivalence between positive innerwise matrix and a positive definite symmetric matrix is derived for the case when all the roots of a real polynomial are inside the unit circle. Extension of the inners approach to the general problems of clustering of roots as well as of the root distribution in the complex plane is briefly mentioned.

The three phases of this problem-estimation, control, and surface placement-are then solved by means of the matrix minimum principle and the calculus of variations. The variational equations are greatly simplified and the order of the problem considerably reduced by the use of optimal controllers at each stage in the search for optimal surface locations. A computer program has been written which uses these equations in solving the surface location problem for winged aircraft. Results of a trial study based on a fourteenth-order model of the Lockheed C-5A transport aircraft are reported."

The observed differences in performance of these algorithms give insight into a basic limitation on control policies derived from formal application of the separation principle."

"The following paper discusses the optimal control of these systems, characterized by a set ofnfirst-order state equations, in which performance is measured by Chebyshev-type functional over the state trajectory. The determination of control functions that minimize the maximum value of a given state function over the trajectory interval is shown to follow directly from the development of a differential minimax cost. The differential minimax cost allows the problem to be formulated as a coordinate minimization in the cost-augmented state space, and leads to the consideration of a set of suboptimal problems whose solutions are shown to converge to the required minimax control. The modifications required for the application of standard variational techniques to the reformulated problem are also discussed. The main result of this study is the demonstration of equivalence between the Chebyshev-type control problem and a more conventional Mayer-type formulation."

The transformations required to obtain the output sensitivities for a single-output multi-input system, which is modeled in a companion form, reduce to the identity."
"This paper deals with recent advances in developing direct methods for studying the transient stability problem of single-machine and multimachine power systems. The paper starts out with the construction of the mathematical model that is usually employed in the analyis of power system transient stability. Computer simulation methods are then briefly discussed, and it is indicated why accurate direct methods for transient stability investigations would be most welcome. It is shown that the classical direct methods, which are based on energy considerations, can be derived and generalized by means of Lyapunov's second method. The main purpose of the paper is to give an exposition of the interesting results that have been obtained by applying Lyapunov's second method to the transient stability problem of single-machine and multimachine power systems. In the final portion of the paper some areas for further research are discussed."
"This paper compares the performance of several non-linear filters for the real-time estimation of the trajectory of a reentry vehicle from its radar observations. In particular, it examines the effect of using two different coordinate systems on the relative accuracy of an extended Kalman filter. Other filters considered are iterative-sequential filters, single-stage iteration filters, and second-order filters. It is shown that a range-direction-cosine extended Kalman filter that uses the measurement coordinate system has less bias and less rms error than a Cartesian extended Kalman filter that uses the Cartesian coordinate system. This is due to the fact that the observations are linear in the range-direction-cosine coordinate system, but nonlinear in the Cartesian coordinate system. It is further shown that the performance of the Cartesian iterative-sequential filter that successively relinearizes the observations around their latest estimates and that of a range-direction-cosine extended Kalman filter are equivalent to first order. The use of a single-stage iteration to reduce the dynamic nonlinearity improves the accuracy of all the filters, but the improvement is very small, indicating that the dynamic nonlinearity is less significant than the measurement nonlinearity in reentry vehicle tracking under the assumed data rates and measurement accuracies. The comparison amongst the nonlinear filters is carried out using ten sets of observations on two typical trajectories. The performance of the filters is judged by their capability to eliminate the initial bias in the position and velocity estimates."

"The minimum-time regulator problem is solved computationally for general linear-discrete systems by a modification of the simplex algorithm of linear programming (LP). The algorithm presented is faster than the LP solutions devised previously, taking but a single application to solve for the optimal control.

Application to a sixth-order process with two control inputs shows that the algorithm is sufficiently economical of running time and storage to be implemented on-line with a small process-control computer."

More specifically, the possibility is considered of transferring a time-invariant linear system from each initial state to any terminal state in a finite time and in such a way that the terminal condition is insensitive to small parameter variations. Partial controllability, suitably defined, leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution to such a problem.

"Given a plant with differential equations characterized by a parameter vector ω which is unknown and slowly varying with time and given a corresponding feedback controller with equations characterized by an adjustable parameter vector γ, a synthesis procedure is presented which leads to a closed-loop adaptive control system for adjusting γ in the face of drift variations in ω. The steps in the synthesis procedure involve 1) the structuring of the basic control system such that model matching is possible for an optimal choice in γ corresponding to every ω,\\gamma^{\\ast} = \\gamma^{\\ast}(\\omega), 2) the selection of a performance index\\rho(\\gamma, \\gamma^{\\ast})which has the properties of a metric function on every adjustment interval, and 3) the derivation of a modified gradient for updating the value of γ which can be implemented on-line during the normal course of system operation. An example of a pitch-rate orientational control system is used to illustrate the synthesis procedure, and the results of a computer simulation study of the overall adaptive system are discussed which include the effects of nonlinearities, disturbance and measurement noises, as well as time variations in the unknown ω-parameters."
"When linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problems are solved, the performance measure takes on a probability density function Of a type which has received very little attention in the literature because of the nonzero-mean multidimensional character of the state process. This paper combines techniques of the fast Fourier transform, recent results of Baggeroer and Schwartz, and the classic methods of Karhunen-Loeve to present what seem to be the first published curves of such densities. As a vehicle for discussion, a one-parameter family of LQG control systems of the minimal variance type serves both to provide examples of the new density curves and to display certain controlled behaviors of the moments of the densities."

"A noniterative method developed by Hsia for the particular case where the transfer function in the Hammerstein model has no zeros is extended to the general case where the transfer function may have zeros. Numerical examples show that the computation time by this method is considerably less than by the iteratire procedure proposed by Narendra and Gallman while the accuracy of the estimates is comparable."
"In this short paper, a new method of system identification is proposed in which the impulse response of a system is determined from a linear combination of the derivatives of the cross-correlation function between an input and the corresponding output of the system. This method is particularly simple when the autocorrelation function\\phi_{xx{(\\tau)of the input is an exponential or a triangular function of the variable \\tau. This method merely requires the autocorrelation function to be undifferentiable at some points in the sense of usual functions. Essentially, the method utilizes the δ-functions appearing when\\phi_{xx}(\\tau)is differentiated in the sense of the distribution, or the generalized function proposed by Schwartz. Results of experiments by computer simulation showed good agreement with the theoretical considerations."
"A direct procedure is presented for obtaining a minimal realization of a multiple-input multiple-output linear time-invariant discrete system from observations of the input and output. Discussion is limited to the case of noise-free observations in order to focus attention on the realization procedure and to display the structure of the resulting realization. This known structural form car be used as a check on the realization procedure. Application of the procedure requires knowledge of an upper bound on the minimal system dimension; however, a modification is given to handle the situation where an upper bound is not known. An example is included to show the operation of the procedure."

"A tutorial guide is presented to the subject of state estimation. The development is presented as an elaboration of the Gauss method of least squares, and consequently differs in viewpoint somewhat from the more conventional development, which is from the viewpoint of linear filter theory. It is shown that all results obtained via the linear filter development are special cases of results obtainable from the method of least squares viewpoint."
"The conventional Kalman approach to discrete filtering involves propagation of a state estimate and an error covariance matrix from stage to stage. Alternate recursive relationships have been developed to propagate a state estimate and a square root error covariance instead. Although equivalent algebraically to the conventional approach, the square root filters exhibit improved numerical characteristics, particularly in ill-conditioned problems. In this paper, current techniques in square root filtering are surveyed and related by applying a duality association. Four efficient square root implementations are suggested, and compared with three common conventional implementations in terms of computational complexity and precision. The square root computational burden should not exceed the conventional by more than 50 percent in most practical problems. An examination of numerical conditioning predicts that the square root approach can yield twice the effective precision of the conventional filter in ill-conditioned problems. This prediction is verified in two examples. The excellent numerical characteristics and reasonable computation requirements of the square root approach make it a viable alternative to the conventional filter in many applications, particularly when computer word length is limited, or the estimation problem is badly conditioned."
"This paper presents an algorithm for the design of asymptotic state estimators (observers) for index-invariant uniformly observable time-varying linear finite-dimensional multivariable systems. The results obtained indicate that asymptotic estimators can be employed in optimally designed regulators provided an increase from the optimal cost is tolerable. It is also shown that any uniformly observable and uniformly controllable plant with index-invariant observability and controllability matrices can be stabilized with an observer."
"The role of the linear-quadratic stochastic control problem in engineering design is reviewed in tutorial fashion. The design approach is motivated by considering the control of a non-linear uncertain plant about a desired input-output response. It is demonstrated how a design philosophy based on 1) deterministic perturbation control, 2) stochastic state estimation, and 3) linearized stochastic control leads to an overall closed-loop control system. The emphasis of the paper is on the philosophy of the design process, the modeling issue, and the formulation of the problem; the results are given for the sake of completeness, but no proofs are included. The systematic off-line nature of the design process is stressed throughout."
"In this paper we discuss the concepts of controllability, reachability, reconstructibility, and observability and attempt to show why these concepts are important in linear systems theory. We show how the above concepts allow us to solve the existence problem of closed-loop regulation of a linear time-invariant finite-dimensional system. The main results related to this are Theorems 4 and 5. Similar but less sharp results are also presented for time-varying systems. The discussion then proceeds to the precise relationships that exist between input-output and state descriptions of systems. Finally, the question of equivalence of internal and input-output stability is discussed."
"The current status of decoupling theory for linear constant multivariable systems is described. The subject is treated in vector space terms and appropriate background concepts including invariant and controllability subspaces are discussed. Suggestions are given for translating vector space operations into matrix operations suitable for computation. The controllability subspace is used to formulate the restricted (static compensation) decoupling problem. Although the most general version of this problem is unsolved, there are known solutions for three special cases. A complete solution to the extended (dynamic compensation) decoupling problem is known. If a linear constant multivariable system can be decoupled at all, by any means whatever, then it can always be decoupled using linear dynamic compensation. The internal structure of a decoupled system is described in simple matrix terms. Using this representation, it is possible to characterize the system pole distributions which may be achieved while preserving a decoupled structure. A procedure is outlined for synthesizing a dynamic compensator of low order which will decouple a system. The procedure actually provides minimal order decoupling compensators for systems in which the number of open-loop inputs equal the number of outputs to be controlled."
"Realization theory for both time-invariant and time-variable linear systems is developed and its applicability to linear quadratic control and filtering is discussed. For time-invariant systems a review of canonical structure theory is given and various properties such as minimality and equivalence are characterized in terms of the Hankel matrix. Realization theory for such systems is then developed based on the Hankel matrix and a new computational algorithm is presented. For time-variable systems the emphasis is on obtaining physically meaningful realizations and several procedures which accomplish this are detailed. For \"constant rank\" systems, a generalization of the Hankel matrix approach is also presented."
"Abstract-Optimal control with a quadratic performance index has been suggested as a solution to the problem of regulating an industrial plant in the vicinity of a steady state. It is shown that such control is usually not feasible, and if feasible can have serious defects."
"Results relating to the state feedback realization of the optimal linear regulator are reviewed. Desirable stability and parameter sensitivity properties of this regulator are discussed. Interpretations of these properties in terms of matrix return differences and comparison sensitivity functions are given. Some related open problems are discussed."
"The theory of optimal control for time delay systems and the quadratic performance criterion is presented from two points of view: 1) the geometric approach, which yields a maximum principle, and 2) the dynamic programming-Carathéodory approach, which yields a feedback controller synthesis. The relationship of the two approaches is discussed, as well as extensions of the theory to non-linear problems and nonlinear performance criterion."
"A new method is presented for the numerical deterruination of the solution of the steady-state matrix Riccati equation. The equation is converted to a canonical form corresponding to Luenberger's canonical representation for controllable multivariable systems. Three special matrices closely associated with Luenberger's canonical form are defined and two related lemmas are established. These results are used to obtain concise expressions for the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix associated with the canonical Riccati equation in terms of the solutions of a much simpler reduced Hamiltonian system. Using a theorem due to Potter the solution of the Riccati equation is written in terms of the concise eigenvector expressions. The method is particularly well suited to problems in which the ratio of system states to system inputs is large and it can lead to a 26 to 1 reduction in the computational effort required to solve the Riccati equation."
"Observers which approximately reconstruct missing state-variable information necessary for control are presented in an introductory manner. The special topics of the identity observer, a reduced-order observer, linear functional observers, stability properties, and dual observers are discussed."
"The application of linear optimal control and least square filtering theory to the design of a control system for the Saturn V launch vehicle is described. System performance is evaluated on the basis of the ratio of the standard deviations of structural load, engine deflection, and lateral velocity drift to their design limits. An optimal linear control is derived from a quadratic performance index in ratios of these critical variables to their design limits. It is shown that this essentially eliminates trial and error search for suitable quadratic index weighting coefficients. It is also shown that the standard deviations are only slightly degraded when feedback gains on actuator states and bending and slosh modes are eliminated, leaving feedback gains on only the three rigid-body states and feed-forward gains on the wind-induced angle of attack and wind-shear velocity. A new method of reducing the state estimation filter dimension to yield suboptimal estimation of the three rigid-body states and two wind model states is applied and shown to cause only a slight additional increase in the standard deviations of the critical system variables."
"A review of the solution of the linear regulator problem for linear systems with state- and control-dependent disturbances is presented. Both the finite and infinite terminal time cases are treated. The solution to the complete state feedback case is given in detail and that for the output feedback case is noted. The general conclusion is that control-dependent noise calls for conservative control (small gains) while state-dependent noise calls for vigorous control (large gains). Of course it is the degree of this behavior that is important and this is given explicitly by the algorithms in this paper."
"A survey of necessary, sufficient, and necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality for a class of time-varying singular quadratic minimization problems is presented. The development of the theory is traced from the time of discovery of the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition. The most important conditions are stated in the form of theorems and are proved. Certain lengthy proofs are only outlined and the reader is referred to the literature for details. The reference list is not intended to be a complete bibliography; rather, it contains, in this author's opinion, the most important references in this area."
"Modern linear regulator and servomechanism theories (of the deterministic type) either ignore system disturbances altogether or assume they can be represented by initial conditions on the plant state vector. Controllers designed by such theories may fail to meet performance specifications when the system is subjected to persistently acting disturbances. In this paper, we show how one can modify existing regulator and servomechanism theories to take into account the presence of persistent fluctuating disturbances. By this means one can design a deterministic controller which consistently maintains set-point regulation, or servotracking, in the face of a bread class of realistic external disturbances. In addition, we show how one can systematically exploit any useful effects that may be present in the action of external disturbances."
"The optimal control of linear systems with respect to quadratic performance criteria over an infinite time interval is treated. Both the case in which the terminal state is free and that in which the terminal state is constrained to be zero are treated. The integrand of the performance criterion is allowed to be fully quadratic in the control and the state without necessarily satisfying the definiteness conditions which are usually assumed in the standard regulator problem. Frequency-domain and time-domain conditions for the existence of solutions are derived. The algebraic Riccati equation is then examined, and a complete classification of all its solutions is presented. It is finally shown how the optimal control problems introduced in the beginning of the paper may be solved analytically via the algebraic Riccati equation."
"In this paper the optimal discrete-time linear-quadratic regulator problem is carefully presented and the basic results are reviewed. Dynamic programming is used to determine the optimization equations. Special attention is given to problems unique to the discrete-time case; this includes, for example, the possibility of a singular system matrix and a singular control-effort weighting matrix. Some problems associated with sampled-data systems are also summarized, e.g., sensitivity to sampling time, and loss of controllability due to sampling. Computational methods for the solution of the optimization equations are outlined and a simple example is included to illustrate the various computational approaches."
"In this tutorial paper the basic principles of least squares estimation are introduced and applied to the solution of some filtering, prediction, and smoothing problems involving stochastic linear dynamic systems. In particular, the paper includes derivations of the discrete-time and continuous-time Kalman filters and their prediction and smoothing counterparts, with remarks on the modifications that are necessary if the noise processes are colored and correlated. The examination of these state estimation problems is preceded by a derivation of both the unconstrained and the linear least squares estimator of one random vector in terms of another, and an examination of the properties of each, with particular attention to the case of jointly Gaussian vectors. The paper concludes with a discussion of the duality between least squares estimation problems and least squares optimal control problems."
"Theoretical results on the optimal control of linear time lag systems with respect to a quadratic criterion are shown to provide a practical feedback controller design procedure. A computational procedure is given for obtaining a stable linear feedback controller. A comprehensive illustration is given of the application of the quadratic criterion results to the design of a feedback controller for a chemical process having transport lag."
"We show how to recursively compute linear least squares filtered and smoothed estimates for a lumped signal process in additive white noise. However, unlike the Kalman-Bucy problem, here only the covariance function of the signal process is known and not a specific state-variable model. The solutions are based on the innovations representation for the observation process."
"The Kalman estimation technique is examined from the point of view of the asymptotic behavior of the errors in the estimates. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the mean-square errors may become unbounded with time, and that this divergence may or may not be correctable by increasing the intensity of process noise assumed in the filtering model General results are derived for multidimensional systems, and both \"true\" and \"apparent\" divergence are demonstrated by a simple scalar system. Divergence due to numerical inaccuracies is considered, and an example problem in orbital navigation is used to demonstrate divergence and its elimination."
"How practical is a Kalman filter? One answer to this question is provided by the computational requirements for the filter. Computational requirements-computational time per cycle (iteration) and required storage-determine minimum sampling rates and computer memory size. These requirements are provided in this paper as functions of the dimensions of the important system matrices for a discrete Kalman filter. Two types of measurement processing are discussed: simultaneous and sequential. It is shown that it is often better to process statistically independent measurements in more than one batch and then to use sequential processing than to process them together via simultaneous processing."
"The application of linear and quadratic programming to optimal control problems and to stochastic or deterministic system design problems is discussed and illustrated with examples."
"This paper treats the general discrete-time linear quadratic stochastic control problem. This problem is solved in two steps. Dynamic programming is used to obtain a solution to the stochastic control problem in which perfect measurements of the state are available. Then the stochastic control problem in which only noisy measurements of a linear operator on the state are available is converted into a new stochastic control problem in which perfect measurements of the state are available. This conversion is based upon Kalman filter theory and is valid whenever the disturbances and measurement noises are Gaussian."
"The problem of controlling stochastic linear systems with quadratic criteria is considered. It is proved that the optimal control law can be realized by the cascade of a Kalman filter and a linear feedback. The importance of different assumptions required in this proof is discussed in detail. This discussion provides some motivation for different extension results."
"The structure of the upper atmosphere can be indirectly probed by light in order to determine the global density structure of ozone, aerosols, and neutral atmosphere. Scattered and directly transmitted light is measured by a satellite and is shown to be a nonlinear function of the state which is defined to be a point-wise decomposition of the density profiles. Dynamics are imposed on the state vector and a structured estimation problem is developed. The estimation of these densities is then performed using a linearized Kalman-Bucy filter and a linearized Kushner-Stratonovich filter."
"Modern control and estimation theory is used to establish a framework for the analysis of manned-vehicle systems. By assuming that the human behaves \"optimally\" in some sense, subject to his inherent psychophysical limitations, a quantitative model is developed for the response characteristics of the human operator. The resultant model can be used to predict task performance and human control characteristics. The model is described in detail and is used to predict quantities measured experimentally in both simple and reasonably complex manual control tasks. Remarkable agreement between measured and predicted quantities is obtained, demonstrating the value and potential of the optimization approach to manned-vehicle systems analysis."
"Combined optimal estimation and control techniques are applied for the first time to satellite tracking systems. Both radio antenna and optical tracking systems of NASA are considered. The optimal estimation is accomplished using an extended Kalman filter, resulting in an estimated state of the satellite and of the tracking system. This estimated state constitutes an input to the optimal controller. The optimal controller treats a linearized system with a quadratic performance index. The maximum principle is applied and a steady-state approximation to the resulting Riccati equation is obtained. A computer program, RATS, implementing this algorithm is described. A feasibility study of real-time implementation, tracking simulations, and parameter sensitivity studies are also reported."
"Estimation of the dynamic state of a power system is the first prerequisite for control and stability prediction under transient conditions. Since the magnetic flux linkages which characterize the instantaneous state of the machines and the system are not directly measurable, a variable-dimension stage-invariant Kalman filter was developed and used to estimate the state of the system based on measurements at each individual machine of instantaneous field and armature current, field and armature voltage, and angular deviation of machine rotor shaft from a synchronous phasor reference. Gaussian white noise in the measurements was assumed, and the filter provided a recursive near-optimal minimum variance estimate of the state of the nonlinear system."
 "Optimal smoothing is applied to the problem of the testing and evaluation of inertial navigation systems at both the component and systems level. The areas studied are gyro testing, system testing in the laboratory, component failure detection during a mission, and post-mission system evaluation. In each case, the problem is cast into the optimal smoothing formalism and preliminary numerical results are obtained. Results reflecting both ideal and practical conditions are presented."
"This paper considers the problem of designing compensators, the dimensions of which are fixed a priori, for linear systems. Two types of compensators are considered: first, static (gain only) compensators which operate directly upon the output signals to generate the controls, and second, dynamic compensators of fixed dimension. The equations that define the parameters of such compensators are developed."

For an nth degree filter, peak power compression ratios in excess of n are shown to be possible."
"The design of wideband coupled transmission line hybrids is complicated by the necessity of having the coupled lines in a close physical proximity to achieve the desired -3.01 dB coupling. The required coupling coefficient is particularly difficult to achieve for coupler designs covering greater than an octave. Several techniques have been used to overcome this limitation. The principal methods are the re-entrant coupler/sup 1/ and the tandem coupler/sup 2/ techniques. The re-entrant coupler employs a modification of the transmission line geometry of a single quarter-wave section to obtain the desired increase in coupling. The technique described in this paper is similar to the tandem coupler technique since a judicious connection of coupled quarter-wave line sections is employed to obtain the desired coupling enhancement rather than a modification of the line cross-section."
"As a new method to design microwave branching or combining circuit which has many terminals, Multi-Port Lattice-type Hybrid network is proposed. We have analyzed the network, and several useful networks have been designed practically."
"Hairpin-line filters are compact structures particularly suited for microstrip and TEM printed circuit realizations. Two types of hairpin-line filters are described in this paper. They are shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b). The image impedance and propagation constant for the infinite periodic hairpin-line has been given previously. Equivalent circuits for several periodically-terminated lines, including the hairpin line were discussed by one of the authors at the recently-concluded IEEE sixth region conference. However, for finite length hairpin-line filters, neither exact or approximate design equations, nor equivalent circuits have been reported. The exact equivalent circuits for the filters of Figs. 1(a) and (b) have been rigorously derived and are presented in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively, for the most important case in which coupling beyond nearest neighbors is negligible. These circuits are topological, but not exact, duals of the well-known interdigital and half-wave parallel-coupled-line filters. Consequently, the exact design tables and approximate design equations may be used in designing hairpin-line filters."

"The integrated X-band mixer described herein has been developed for an integrated phased array system requiring a 1 GHz intermediate frequency. This high IF allows several novel design approaches. A single ended mixer is feasible since LO noise suppression is not necessary at such a high IF. Also, image (2f/sub LO/ - f/sub s/ ) and sum frequency (f/sub LO/ + f/sub s/) enhancement techniques can be used to recover a portion, of the energy normally lost in the mixing process; resulting in a conversion loss improvement of up to 1.5 dB in the enhanced mode as compared to the broadband mode of operation. To predict the \"enhanced\" mixer performance, to include a sum frequency port and also account for finite diode and filter losses."
"Two integrated mixers on a ceramic substrate of 10 mil thickness for frequencies of 18 and 26 GHz and an IF of 1 - 2 GHz have been developed. The development of Schottky-Barrier beam lead diodes for signal frequencies of 30 GHz and higher and the high state of thinfilm technology makes it possible to build low noise integrated mixers in this frequency range. The advantages are small size and a simple way of production, the disadvantages are high ohmic losses with increasing frequency."
"A SPDT microstrip switch has been designed on a plastic (polyolefin) substrate to switch two 10 watt cw carriers into a common load over the frequency range 1.7 to 2.3 GHz. No tuning adjustments are used over this 30% bandwidth to obtain a 90 dB minimum isolation, a 23 dB minimum return loss, and a one dB maximum insertion loss. Units now in production typically have a .6 dB insertion loss, a 26 dB return loss and isolation levels of 105/spl plusmn/5 dB."
"A miniature high power, beryllia substrate, lumped element, PIN diode phase shifter has been developed. Design expressions are presented for two UHF models, which operate at kilowatt powers and exhibit 7% bandwidths with low insertion loss."
"This paper describes the development of a unique, integrated, low-noise, X-band, sweeping superheterodyne receiver. The general confignration of the receiver was dictated by the requirements for typical microwave sweeping receivers, which include low noise figure, large dynamic range, high conversion gain, good image rejection, narrow instantaneous IF bandwidth, wide tuning range, and rapid sweep capability. Figure 1 includes a wideband tunnel-diode amplifier (TDA) to provide an acceptably low noise figure, considering the relatively undistinguished noise performance typical of wideband microstrip mixers when driven by solid-state local oscillators and degraded by high-frequency IF amplifiers. The mixer is of the image-rejection type, consisting essentially of two identical balanced mixers with proper phasing at the signal, local oscillator (LO), and IF-output ports to provide image cancellation. A Gunn device was selected for the internal oscillator, as this type provides ample fundamental X-band power, and is sufficiently quiet to permit electronic tuning with a moderate resonator Q. The latter enables the oscillator to be varactor tuned, thereby avoiding the heavy, bulky, power-consuming electromagnets that are associated with YIG-tuned X-band devices."

"On Fig. 1 is shown an actual plot of wavecrests on the surface of crystal. Notice that these wavecrests are not regular, they appear to be relatively flat within the beam then they appear to fall back rapidly away from the beam center. That is because lithium niobate crystal is highly anisotropic, and the waves moving slightly off the beam direction tend to move more slowly than waves directly on the beam direction. The straight-crested surface wave is generated on lithium niobate with a transducer shown in Fig. 2. The position of the fingers in the transducer matches the position of the crests and troughs of Fig. 1, and if an electrical signal at the appropriate frequency is applied to the transducer then a surface acoustic wave beam radiates from these transducers. The transducer is relatively efficient--a bit less than half the available electrical energy is put into the desired acoustic wave with this particular design."
"Sufficient quantitative information for the realization of optimum microwave frequency acoustic surface wave devices will be presented. Propagation losses, beam steering losses and diffraction losses will be listed for materials of technological inportance. Figures of merit will be defined and computed."
"The junction between the plated and unplated portions of a substrate theoretically exhibits zeros of both transmission and reflection for acoustic surface waves incident at certain angles from either region. These properties offer some useful device possibilities."
"A surface acoustic wave phase shifter has been realized by utilizing the interaction between the piezoelectric fields of a surface wave and an adjacent semiconductor. One important feature of this interaction is that the velocity of the surface wave depends on the electrical properties of materials placed in the vicinity of, but not mechanically touching, the piezoelectric. For example, Campbell and Jones have calculated the velocity of surface waves on the y-plane of LiNbO/sub 3/ for the case of a free surface ( Fig. 1, /spl omega/h = /spl infin/) and the case where an infinitesimally thin perfect conductor is placed on the surface (/spl omega/h = 0). For waves propagating in the Z-direction (/spl ominus/ = 90/spl deg/) the velocity decreases by about 2. 5% when an electrical short is placed at the surface. This velocity change can be achieved by purely electrical means by varying the free carrier concentration at the semiconductor surface. The method we have used to accomplish this is to apply an electric field normal to the semiconductor surface as illustrated in the inset to Fig. 2. Here the semiconductor functions as one plate of a capacitor and the induced charge at the surface then varies with the applied voltage V."
"An equivalent circuit model has been modified to include interelectrode reflections. Using this extended model, the second order effects observed experimentally for 13-bit PSK filters on YZ LiNbO/sub 3/ can be qualitatively predicted."
"A hybrid combination of an acoustic surface wave tapped delay line and semiconductor switching devices is used to generate bi-phase coded sequences and to serve as the matched filter for these sequences.

"The Arc Plasma Spray process (APS) makes possible the fabrication of complex ferrite/dielectric composite structures suitable for use as substrates for microwave integrated circuits. A typical two layered microstrip geometry is shown in the insert of Fig. 2. The usual microstrip design problems are now complicated because of the choice possible in the selection of the ferrite and dielectric material constants (dielectric constant and permeability) and the relative heights of the two materials. As an example of the structures possible, a substrate for a non-reciprocal latching meanderline phase shifter is shown in Fig. 1. TT1-390 ferrite material was deposited in a preformed cavity of a 0.035\" substrate with /spl epsiv//sub d/ = 13. A metallization is made and the meanderline structure is formed. Circulators, filters, etc., can be fabricated in the same fashion. Some of the advantages of this approach are: a) the design of previously unavailable circuits is now feasible, b) ferrite materials can be deposited only where they are required in a given circuit, c) the ferrite microwave properties are maintained or enhanced through the APS process, d) high power handling capability is now possible in planar MIC's and e) potential cost savings ."
"From recent work revealing that rare-earth ions of fixed concentration in a garnet ferrimagnet give rise to an additional spin-wave line-width term that is inversely proportional to the saturation magnetization of the host garnet, it is shown that rare-earth impurities found in commercial yttrium end gadolinium oxides used for producing ferrimagnets can contribute to unwanted variations in the peak power handling capacity of low-field microwave devices."
"Lithium ferrites with properties comparable to the more expensive garnets are discussed. Hysteresis loops are square. Magnetic and dielectric losses, stress and temperature sensitivities are good . Data on phasers and a circulator are given."
"The ferrite circulator has come a long way from its beginning as a practical application of Faraday rotation some eighteen to twenty years ago. The name, circulator, was coined by A. G. Fox, and in the process of this development, circulators have assumed many forms and an almost equal number of interpretations. Circulators to handle the duplexing function in megawatt systems have utilized differential phase shifters in conjunction with 3 dB power splitters (couplers or tees). A more compact and economical version of the circulator evolved in the use of the turnstile junction. This circulator design also depends on a split of the input power and a phase cancellation of waves due to phase shift introduced in the ferrite loaded turnstile circular guide section. While more compact and potentially cheaper, the turnstile adjustment is somewhat critical and its resulting bandwidth rather limited."
"A microstrip circulator employing a stepped ground plane is described. It has the advantages of giving good bandwidth, low forward loss, high peak power handling capability, and a reduction in size over conventional below-resonance devices."
"The electrical characteristics of the ferrite substrate microstrip circulator having wider magnetized region than conventional one have been studied. This work enables us to compose a compact and simplified wideband circulator without the impedance matching networks. The electric field measurement shows that the wideband characteristics are realized by the combination of the conventional n=1 mode and a nonresonant mode different but compatible to the former. A C-band version measuring 15 mm in diameter offers more than 20 dB isolation and an insertion loss less than 0.5 dB over a bandwidth of 50 percent or more with the center frequency of 6.3 GHz."

"A method of controlling the conventionally noisy FM characteristics of an IMPATT diode oscillator by properly terminating the second harmonic frequency is described. The result is also characterized by a self-locking mechanism with a resulting mechanical tuning range, via the second harmonic circuit, of up to 100 MHz at lower X-band. Effects of second harmonic tuning on IMPATT reflection - type amplifier operating bandwidth is also discussed."
"The Avalanche or Gunn diode oscillators in simple single resonator circuits usually have considerably more FM noise then Klystron or crystal-oscillator, multiplier-chain type signal sources. Transmission cavity stabilization by TE/sub oln/ mode cavities is applied to both Avalanche and Gunn diode X-Band oscillators to yield simple, useful signal sources with FM noise lower than most other signal sources. Some additional studies show that a cavity stabilized silicon avalanche diode oscillator used as a synchronizing signal to injection phase lock a Gunn oscillator has the best combination of low FM and AM noise."
"A charge-storage diode frequency tripler can be modeled as two cascaded impedance inverters. This approach has been used to design and construct a tripler at 1.06 GHz input frequency with a measured midband efficiency of 50% and a 3 dB band-width of 38%."

"With the surge of design activity of ferrite components for phased array RADARs, a knowledge of the microwave characteristics of partially magnetized ferrites is a very useful asset. Phase shifters, circulators, and switches are most economically designed if the biasing field can be kept small. A preferred configuration consists of the microwave ferrite being latched into a major or minor loop (flux drive) remanent state. For such operation the internal dc magnetic field is quite small (the order of the coercive force). Anisotropy and demagnetizing effects due to sample shape and local inhomogeneities such as pores and second phase prevent the material from being completely magnetized, and hence the sample is in a partially magnetized state."
"High performance millimeter wavelength phase shifters are needed for electronically scanned phased array antenna applications. Some work has been reported on toroidal, latching, nonreciprocal phasers to operate at 35 GHz and above. However, the critical nature of the tolerances inherent in such designs makes fabrication extremely difficult above 50 GHz and leads to cost and reproducibility problems even at 35 GHz. This paper describes a new reciprocal ferrite phaser which is suited for use in the 35-100 GHz region. The phaser is simple to fabricate and exhibits electrical characteristics which compare favorably with its nonreciprocal counterpart. These phasers may be fabricated individually or in groups to form a portion of a phased array aperture."
"An analog ferrite phase shifter has been developed for applications requiring an accurate relationship between phase shift and control current. A prototype unit is described that operates over a 1.3 GHz. range at X-band with VSWR under 1.2:1, loss under 1 dB., hysteresis at /spl plusmn/1 degree, and negligible frequency dispersion of phase shift."
"The use of periodic loading to enhance the differential phase shift of a remanence ferrite phase shifter, while maintaining frequency compensation, has been reported previously. This paper reports on progress in the use of this techniques and the characteristics obtained versus the degree of periodic loading. The circuit has low cost potential and results in a reduction of the size and switching energy of the phase shifter; however, this is obtained at the expense of peak power handling capability."

"In the last few years, significant progress has been made in the development of improved transmitting-receiving (TR) devices that provide increased reliability in comparison with gas-discharge TR tubes. For example, an all-ferrite TR device consisting of a high-power limiter and three fast-switching circulators is finding increasing application in modern airborne weather RADARs, This paper describes still another advance in the area of TR devices: a newly-developed, all-solid-state, passive limiter."
"X and Ku-Band subsidiary resonance type of ferrite limiters have been developed for a solid state replacement for the gas tube portions of TR-limiters. When used in conjunction with PIN and varactor diode limiters, completely passive receiver protection is obtained."

"The field of equivalent circuit generation is examined in relation to microwave circuits. A method useful for microwave circuit design is explained.

"This paper describes a number of improvements to the finite-element method. The functional, whose extremum is furnished by the solution of Poisson's equation over the union of a number of piecewise homogeneous regions, is presented. The Rayleigh-Ritz method, using a two variable power series as a trial function, is employed to find an approximation to the solution. It is shown that Cauchy and Neumann boundary conditions are natural ones for the functional and that the interface condition of continuity of normal flux is satisfied naturally as well. The method of formulating the Dirichlet boundary condition, as a natural one, is described. The paper shows that a curved boundary need not be approximated by triangle sides but may be defined as accurately as desired."

"Applications: Space Power Station, Recently, Dr. Peter Glaser of A. D. Little, Inc., has proposed that we solve some of the pollution and natural-resource depletion problems associated with present methods of generating electrical energy by tapping otherwise unused solar energy. He would place in synchronous orbit a very large solar cell array and transmit the electrical energy thus captured to the earth by means of a microwave power transmission system. In view of the fact that his concept would indeed be near pollution-free, would not use any of the earth's fossil or nuclear fuel reserves, and could make practical use of our acquired space technology, it is receiving favorable attention."

"Cavity-controlled microwave local oscillators are widely used since they are tunable over a wide frequency range with excellent output characteristics and generate little noise. However, the maximum frequency stability is limitted to /spl plusmn/5x10/sup -5/. To increase the frequency stability, a crystal-controlled oscillator is used to perform injection locking in the cavity-controlled oscillator. This paper describes a new injection locking method, explains the theory of injection locking alarm circuit and compares the experimental results with mathematical calculations. The injection locking method and alarm circuit based on this technique are very simple and easy to incorporate into high frequency-stability microwave local oscillator."

"In view of the fact that microwaves first impacted our technology during or slightly before World War II, it is natural that the greatest number of microwave applications have been directed to the solution of military problems. Very advanced techniques have been developed and form the basis of many of our modern weapon systems. Development costs have been astronomical but were made possible by a very large military budget. Now with a shrinking military budget, thoughts must be directed toward applying microwave technology to other areas. At least one of these areas is transportation, both public and private. Although it does not begin to have the kind of federal budget that the Department of Defense enjoyed for many years, it can sustain a modest amount of development effort."
"A description of two new experimental RADAR driver aids is presented. One adds longitudinal control to existing automobile speed controls to automatically operate both throttle and brakes in response to traffic flow. The second RADAR system acts as a rear vision aid."
"Miniradars utilizing the Doppler phenomenon have been developed for sale to the general public in the car aftermarket, as well as to car manufacturers, for providing safe-following headway control of car motion, and for detection of road hazards and collision threats both in front and in the back blind spots. Application to collision-anticipatory sensing for air-bag inflation and integration with anti-skid devices are also significant developments.

"Design figures are presented for four types of diode phase shifters. Comparison is made of their bandwidths, and it is shown that most of them can work over an octave bandwidth. The fourth type of phase shifter is new using lumped element high-pass and low-pass circuits."
"A series of C- and X-band thin-film microstrip electronically variable attenuators have been developed, using PIN diode chips in an iterated structure, which exhibit half-to-full octave bandwidth capability. Using 10 PIN diodes, mounted singly and in pairs on a 1-inch square substrate, these attenuators exhibit less than 1.6 and 1.8 dB low attenuation insertion loss, about 34 and 27 dB maximum attenuation, and less than 1.6:1 and 1.4:1 VSWR over the 4 to 8 and 8 to 12 GHz frequency ranges, respectively."
"The negative impedance converter (NIC) is an active circuit element which has been increasingly useful in low frequency applications. It is a 2 port device which converts any load impedance at one port to an input impedance -Z as seen at the other port. The NIC can be used to synthesize negative impedances and admittances which are then used to generate transfer functions or impedance functions which are not physically realizable without active circuits. We have developed two types of NIC circuits suitable for VHF and microwave applications. The first type of NIC is based upon the idealized circuit shown in Fig. 1. Particular care has been taken in the design and layout of this circuit to minimize stray reactance which might reduce the frequency response of this NIC realization. The transistors used in this circuit are NEC 2SC 989's which are relatively inexpensive and have an f/sub T/ of 3 GHz. Figure 2 is a sketch of the layout of a practical realization of the RF portion of this NIC. Figure 3 demonstrates that the NIC can indeed neutralize a 22 pf capacitor up to 120 MHz. Figure 4 shows the effect of temperature variations on a lossless single-pole L-C filter which used an NIC to generate a -R which cancelled the loss in the inductor. The loaded Q of the tuned circuit is 100. Without the NIC, the loss of the tuned circuit was 8 dB. The noise figure of the filter and NIC was 17 dB and the in-band third order intercept was -12 dBm."
"Gigabit-rate communications will use high speed logic systems which will use gigahertz-rate hi-stable devices for various logic functions including waveform generation. The chief requirement of such devices is the generation of square-wave end steep-rise-front voltage, current, and power functions. This paper will review the long art of bi-stable devices and will compare the features of each including consideration of speed and developed voltage. The impact of new transistors with high F/sub T/'s will be discussed, and experimental counter logic devices will be discussed which count at speeds at one gigahertz, and will include a discussion of experimental signal sources developing waveforms such as square waves, and pseudo random codes at gigahertz rates."
"A family of X-band thin-film microstrip tunnel diode amplifiers (TDA's ) have been developed for use in broadband, high-performance receivers. These TDA's exhibit half-octave bandwidth capability, with about 9-dB gain per stage over 8.0 to 11.5 GHz, 5.0 to 6.0 dB noise figure (using Ge tunnel diodes), and -14 to -17 dB output level at 1-dB gain compression (using GaAs tunnel diodes). This represents a considerable advance in performance with respect to previously reported MIC - TDA's, shows a two-stage TDA, incluching an output isolator per stage."
"This paper describes the techniques evolved and the results obtained during the development of solid state RF component for use in the 50-70 GHz frequency range. The program is directed specifically toward the generation of a reliable, low noise, RF \"front-end\" for a 60 GHz radiometric receiver. The critical. components of the \"front -end\" are the low noise (low conversion loss ) mixer and the local oscillator. The mixer consists of GaAs Schottky barrier diodes of very high cut-off frequency; the local oscillator utilizes a silicon avalanche diode oscillator."
"The use of liquid suspensions as a new class of microwave artificial dielectrics was explored. Liquid media were constructed with permittivities dependent on the strength of a low-frequency electric control field. Operating characteristics were measured for a 50 KW, 360/spl deg/ Ku-band waveguide phase shifter employing a practical liquid-suspension dielectric. Other applications are in electrically variable wideband lenses and in the analog control of phased arrays."

"The propagation of guided waves in a rectangular geometry having impedance boundary conditions is investigated. An impedance compatibility relation is derived that must be satisfied in order that a separable modal solution exists for a given impedance configuration. Several new rectangular waveguides are developed; among them are 1) a tall rectangular waveguide operating in a dominant H/sub 10/ mode with no H/sub 0N/ modes; 2) a rectangular waveguide with two parallel anisotropic impedance surfaces; 3) a rectangular waveguide with two parallel walls having isotropic impedance surfaces, the other two walls being anisotropic; 4) a rectangular waveguide supporting only E modes; and 5) rectangular coaxial systems containing impedance surfaces. The modal structure of rectangular waveguides with impedance boundary conditions offers advantages over the conventional waveguide. The potential of oversizing for low-loss and high-power applications is enhanced because of the additional modal control provided by the impedance surfaces. Other applications are suggested."
"A vector variational formulation of the Maxwell curl equations in terms of all six electromagnetic field components is developed for circular waveguides symmetrically loaded with dialectric. A guide-wall boundary integral term, which renders the electric Dirichlet boundary conditions natural, is included in the variational expression. It is, therefore, unnecessary for the trial electromagnetic field functions to satisfy any guide-wall boundary conditions. This greatly extends the class of problems for which the vector variational-solution procedure is applicable and permits simple expansion functions for the trial fields, thus facilitating integral calculations. Solution results for several hybrid-mode circulator-waveguide structures are presented and compared with available experimental data."
"A numerical analysis is presented in terms of finite elements of hybrid-mode propagation in closed microstrip. Two modes with zero frequency cutoff are described; one is a quasi-TEM mode and the other a surface mode. Also investigated is a third mode which corresponds to the lowest order waveguide mode in the absence of the strip."
"The design of a new type of elliptic filter, particularly suitable for narrow-band low-loss applications at VHF and UHF, is presented. The filter is derived from a lumped-element bandpass prototype by replacing the lumped inductors, which are normally the main contributory factors to the loss, by a comparatively low-loss distributed network. The latter consists of an n-wire digital line short-circuited at one end, the length of which is i/8 or less. An experimental elliptic filter of fifth order was constructed at 136.6 MHz with a pass bandwidth of 5 MHz, having 60-dB points at /spl plusmn/ 7 MHz from midband. The measured insertion loss of 1.1 dB is lower than that of a comparable lumped-element filter by a factor of at least 3,5:1. It compares favorably also with a comb-line filter, both in terms of loss and physical size."
"Theoretical and experimental results of \"open\" microstrip propagation on both a pure dielectric and a demagnetized ferrite substrate are presented. The theory enables one to obtain the frequency dependence of phase velocity and characteristic impedance, and also to obtain the electromagnetic field quantities around the microstrip line. It utilizes a Fourier transform method in which the hybrid-mode solutions for a \"fictitious\" surface current at the substrate-air interface are summed in such a way as to represent the fields caused by a current distribution that is finite only over the region occupied by the conducting strip and is assumed equal to that for the quasi-static case."
"A vector variational formulation of the Maxwell equations applicable to cylindrical waveguide problems is developed in terms of the electric E field. This three-component vector formulation allows an approximate solution of loaded waveguide structures which cannot be described in terms of a single-field component or potential function. The three-component formulation is more economical than corresponding six-component formulations for a given order of approximation because the solution matrices which result are reduced in size (/spl sim/1/2) and contain fewer zero elements. The E-field variational integral is expanded in terms of the field components for inhomogeneously loaded parallel-plate and rectangular waveguide geometries to illustrate a computer-assisted vector variational solution procedure."
"Dispersion characteristics of shielded microstrip lines are investigated using a new technique. The method utilizes the well-known singular integral equation approach for deriving an alternate form of eigenvalue equation with superior convergence properties. It is shown that accurate numerical results may be obtained from this eigenvalue equation using only a 2x2 matrix equation. In comparison, the conventional formulation of the problem requires the use of matrices that are much larger in size. Aside from the numerical efficiency, the simplicity of the method makes it possible to conveniently extract higher order modal solutions for the propagation constants that affect the high-frequency application of microstrip lines. Even though the derivation of the determinantal equation requires some intricate mathematical manipulations, the user may bypass these completely and use the final eigenvalue equation which is programmable on the computer."
"Approximate solutions for the complex propagation constant in semiconductor loaded waveguides are obtained by expansion of the fields in terms of a finite number of the empty waveguide modes. Solutions are obtained for the case of partial loading in the narrow dimension of the guide, which explicitly exhibit the non-reciprocal effects observed in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Coupling between the TE/sub 10/ and TM/sub 11/ empty waveguide modes is shown to explain qualitatively the observed experimental effects. Good quantitative agreement with experiments using Si samples is obtained."
"An electromagnetic wave absorber utilizing ferrite or rubber ferrite composed of ferrite powder and rubber is described. In our investigation, the existence of a matching frequency f/sub m/ and a matching thickness t/sub m/ has been found. The terms f/sub m/ and t/sub m/ mean that the ferrite which is backed with a conducting plate can be a perfect absorber only under the conditions that the frequency of the incident wave is f/sub m/ and that the thickness of the ferrite is t/sub m/.Each ferrite has two matching frequencies f/sub m1/, f/sub m2/, (f/sub m1<f/sub m2/) and two matching thicknesses t/sub m1/, t/sub m2/, respectively. The f/sub m1/ of solid ferrite cannot be beyond 2 GHz. Through the development of rubber ferrite, the upper limit of f/sub m1/ can be overcome and f/sub m2/ ranges from 4 to 12 GHz. The matching thickness t/sub m1/ is a simple function of Snoek's value S and ranges from 4 to 10 mm regardless of f/sub m1/. The superiority of ferrite or rubber ferrite to lossy dielectric material as an absorber has been noticed in the frequency range under 7.5 GHz. The characteristics of matched load at 77/spl deg/K was investigated with success."
"Propagation in one-dimensional random media is studied using matrix methods. This work applies, for example, to plane wave propagation in layered-media TEM transmission lines with random spacing, etc., where the spurious mode is a reflected wave. The imperfection is assumed to have a white spectrum. Similar techniques have previously been applied to multimode waveguide where the spurious mode is a forward wave. The present work is of interest because it yields exact computable results for certain transmission statistics in a simple way. These may be of help in comparing various approximate perturbation theories and in finding out what happens to signals in very long random transmission media where perturbation theory fails. Specifically, we compute the expected value and the variance of the complex loss (input/output) for lossless (i.e., zero heat loss) and Iossy random media. In the lossless case only we compute the expected reciprocal input resistance and conductance, which Zakai has previously shown to be computable using a different approach. The imperfection (e.g., dielectric constant /spl epsiv/(x) of a continuous random medium, capacitance C(x) of a TEM line) is assumed to consist of a dc component and a white ac component. The more practical case of a flat low-pass spectrum for the ac component is considered, and the region of applicability of the present results to this problem is indicated. Similar methods may be used to calculate the covariance of the (complex) loss and higher moments of the loss and of the reciprocal input resistance and conductance for zero heat loss, although these calculations are not carried out here. The covariance would be required in order to study signal distortion in such a random medium."
"A new method of synthesizing matched broad-band TEM-mode three-ports is presented. The three-ports consist of n sections in cascade with each section composed of two coupled lossless transmission lines of electrical length /spl theta/ and an intermediate resistor. The main object is to analyze and design broad-band unsymmetrical structures with the symmetrical three-port as a special and important case. The analysis of the three-port is performed by means of a more convenient four-port analysis. An even-odd-mode method is used and a new definition of the odd mode is introduced. This new definition considerably simplfies the treatment of unsymmetrical three-and four-ports with one half of the network identical to the other apart from an impedance scaling factor. The analysis yields two uncoupled two-ports in each mode. The even-mode networks are identical with cascaded quarter-wave impedance transformers while the odd-mode networks contain all the resistors. A new technique for their design is presented and a computer program for complete synthesis of hybrid three-ports has been worked out. Several experimental stripline three-ports were built. A three-section unsymmetrical (k=1.7) matched three-port showed a measured isolation better than 20 dB and a maximum VSWR of 1.3 from 5 to 12 GHz. The total loss of a four-section equal-power divider was 0.2dB, maximum VSWR 1.25, and minimum isolation 23 dB over the frequency range 2.5-12.0 GHz."
"A method is given whereby the range of frequencies of operation of an inverted common collector transistor circuit (synthesized inductance) is found experimentally as a function of bias current. A complementary relationship is shown to exist between this method and that which gives the frequency range by determining the maximum reflected negative resistance characteristics."
"A grid-separated microwave triode oscillator which uses a common capacitance as the feedback element is examined. This particular design lends itself to a straightforward theoretical analysis which is shown to be in good agreement with experimental results at 2.5 GHz."
"The orthogonality properties of the modes of a magnetoplasma waveguide involve a set of adjoint modes. We show how to obtain these adjoint modes without calculus in some particular cases."
"The availability of commercial precision coaxial hybrids makes measurements on balanced two-conductor transmission lines as easy and as practical as on an unbalanced coaxial system. These hybrids, when used as a balun, transform an unbalanced coaxial system to a balanced shielded system and because of the nature of the balanced shielded system permit the measurement of the characteristics of loads connected thereto by the use of commercial coaxial test equipment. This technique has been successfully used from 600 MHz to 5 GHz, and with presently available components can be used at HF and VHF as well. The theory upon which the measurement technique is based is outlined and some results of an experimental verification included."
"A method is presented to generate pulse-modulated signals at C band and beyond where the pulse duration may be in the order of a nanosecond. The generation technique involves the use of a TEM-mode pulse-forming network having a time-limited impulse response and a source of step-modulated RF energy."
"This correspondence describes a successful design procedure for transitions in circular waveguide. The design procedure is discussed and a universal design curve developed. As an example, one point on a 12-in taper from WRC 283 (2.81-in ID) to WRC 621 (1.28-in ID) is calculated. Test results for the 12-in taper in the 5.925-to 6.425-GHz common carrier band are given."
"An S-band four-port E-plane waveguide junction circulator has been developed that has a power-handling capability of 1-MW peak and 1-kW average. Improved ferrite materials and dielectric matching techniques have resulted in a device having a high-power insertion loss of 0.5 dB and a biasing magnetic field of 400 G. The E-plane configuration lends itself to a compact lightweight circulator design having a high-power capability greater than the H-plane configuration, since RF breakdown problems are alleviated by locating the ferrite in the region of minimum RF electric field. The final device requires approximately one-tenth the amount of ferrite and permanent magnet material used in comparable differential phase-shift circulators. The size and weight are reduced by a factor of approximately 5."
"A 360/spl deg/ phase modulator using two series-tuned varactors in a parallel connection is described. The design minimizes the change in total phase shfit with frequency and gives a small attenuation ripple. The modulator is centered at 2 GHz and gives a total phase shift at 360/spl deg/ at the center frequency, an attenuation ripple of 1.3 dB over a 10-percent bandwidth and a 7/spl deg/ decrease of phase shift at the band edges."

"This correspondence describes certain analogies between ray-optical and modal (equivalent-network) procedures employed in the study of a variety of propagation, guiding, and scattering phenomena."
"The input impedance of the Bosma model for a stripline circulator has been computed for light coupling in below-resonance operation. The result agrees with the two-tank circuit model proposed by Fay and Comstock and with experimental measurements."
"The boundary value solution for the resonance frequencies of a spherical cavity with an impedance wall is presented for the TE and TM cases. It is found that in the TE case with a capacitive cavity surface, a new mode exists and corresponds to the fundamental mode. This is in contrast to the perfectly conducting spherical cavity where a TM mode is the lowest order mode."
"The spurious, and sometimes troublesome spikes in circulator characteristics are shown by analysis and experiment to be due to hybrid resonant modes of the ferrite post open-resonator structure. They can be excited by axial nonuniformities such as imperfect contact between the ferrite and the conducting walls, but they cannot exist in axially uniform structures with axially uniform excitation."
"The microwave properties of 81-Permalloy (81 percent nickel-19 percent iron) films less than 1050 /spl Aring/ thick and without an external magnetic field have been studied at 10 GHz. The measured dc conductivity values /spl sigma//sub m/ were approximately one-half the values (/spl sigma//sub m/) predicted by the Fuchs-Sondheimer (F-S) theory for monovalent metals, and an indirect check was obtained by comparing measured reflection and transmission coefficients (R and T) with values calculated using /spl sigma//sub m/ and /spl sigma//sub s/. The power transmission coefficient was obtained from the insertion loss, and calculated values of insertion loss using /spl sigma//sub m/ agreed within 2 percent with directly measured values. Calculated values of R using /spl sigma//sub m/ showed good agreement with directly measured values for film thicknesses less than 300 /spl Aring/, but with thicknesses between 300 /spl Aring/ and 1050 /spl Aring/ the directly measured values of R were up to 5 percent smaller than those predicted using /spl sigma//sub m/. Using the F-S conductivity, calculated values of T were approximately an order of magnitude lower than directly measured values, and calculated values of R were as much as 13 percent higher than directly measured values."
"The physical and electrical characteristics of a 0.995-in-diameter oversize circular waveguide and its associated transitions operating in the 92- to 96-GHz band are described. Both linear and nonlinear taper transitions were employed in converting from the WR-10 dominant-mode rectangular waveguide (0.100 by 0.050 in ID) to a 0.995-in-diameter circular waveguide. The results of the present investigations indicate that the nonlinear taper transitions yield considerably less multimoding effects. The measured attenuation for a 0.995-in-diameter oversize copper circular waveguide is 0.028 dB/ft as compared to a theoretical value of 0.02 dB/ft."
"Results of experiments to determine the effect of small manganese substitution on the properties of mixed yttrium-gadolinium garnets are reported. The composition Y/sub 2.1/Gd/sub 0.9/Fe/sub 5-z/ Mn/sub z/0/sub 12/ (0<z<0.15) has been investigated, and the variation of remanent properties, resonance linewidth, and dielectric loss tangent are given. It is shown that the use of manganese can lead to a significant reduction in the variation of remanent phase shift with external stress, and the composition with z = 0.15 is shown to be comparable with magnesium-manganese-aluminium spinel in this respect."
"A method for analyzing general thick-strip transmission lines is reported. Calculated characteristic impedances based on this method are consistent with other theory and experiment in the case of thick-strip microstrip lines. The case of thick-strip lines with three dielectric layers and shielding is also presented."
"FormuIas are derived for the direct calculation of the scattering parameters of a linear two-port, using measurements made on a test set having residual, tracking, and mistermination errors. The problem is formulated by representing the measuring system in terms of scattering parameters. Solutions using this formulation have previously been obtained only in an implicit manner using an iterative approach. The associated calibration procedure is included."

"Summary form only given, as follows. With the increasing usage of microwaves in industrial and civilian applications,1 it is essential that their biological effects be determined and understood. It is hoped that this issue will acquaint the microwave engineer with the present understanding of these problems and the work which is being carried out in this area. It will also become apparent that this is a fertile field for research, and microwave engineers can certainly contribute to the understanding of these problems if they wish to get involved. The effort to organize this issue was enormous and we were very fortunate to have Dr. John M. Osepchuk as Guest Editor. His tremendous efforts in organizing this issue are greatly appreciated."
"This special issue is devoted to a survey of existing knowledge and continuing research on the biological effects of microwaves. The contents of this issue, through invited and contributed papers, are directed toward portraying the present state of affairs in this field. To what extent newly presented controversy and omissions in certain areas of research and engineering detract from the extensive accomplishment of past research and engineering remains for the reader to judge. In this issue the extensive biological research in the West is reviewed from a historical viewpoint and from a physical viewpoint. A variety of viewpoints are expressed in the other papers on biological experiments. Another category of papers is directed toward analysis and measurement of microwave fields on biological systems. The remaining papers include some interesting studies of field solutions in biological tissue with special application to diathermy. In the category of applications and engineering reports there are only three papers, which reflects the lack of activity in this field in recent years. This view is supported by the fact that only one report in this issue deals with new instrumentation for measurement of hazardous fields."
"This Special Issue on the Biological Effects of Microwaves is particularly timely. US Public Law 90-602, known as the \"Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968,\" was adopted by the 90th Congress on October 18, 1968. The purpose was to protect the public health and safety from the dangers of electronic product radiation. Microwave generators fall under the purview of this legislation. There are some reports in which it is concluded that long time exposures to low power levels are beneficial. A better understanding of these effects is necessary. As will be seen from the table of contents, this issue includes three different aspects of the problem: biological experiments and biophysical mechanisms, analysis and measurement of microwave fields in biological systems, and applications and engineering reports. With this diversification of reports, it is quite likely that the general understanding of the problem will be enhanced in a favorable way by this special issue on the biological effects of microwaves."
"During World War II, the Department of Defense medical services became interested and concerned about possible hazards associated with the development, operation, and maintenance of the increasing numbers of RADARs and other radio-frequency emitting electronic equipment. After some investigations by the U. S. Navy and the U. S. Air Force, responsibility for research on the biomedical aspects of microwave radiation was delegated in July, 1957, as a tri-service arrangement to Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base, N. Y. Primary responsibility for coordination of the program rested with Dr. George M. Knauf, USAF (MC). The Tri-Service Program included investigation of effects of exposure of the whole-body, selected organs and tissues, single cells, and enzyme systems using various power levels, pulsed and continuous wave, in the frequency spectrum from 200 through 24 500 MHz under acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. The most important contribution of the Tri-Service Program was the validation of the 10-mW/cm/sup 2/ safety standard. The Tri-Service Program is to date the only large-scale coordinated effort in the Western world to elucidate and understand some of the basic mechanisms of microwave bioeffects and to assess possible health implications of this form of energy. This paper constitutes an overview of the Tri-Service Program to provide some historical insight into the significance of the program and its contributions to our understanding of the biologic effects of microwaves. The initiative, foresight, and drive of Colonel Knauf was an immeasurable contribution to the success of the program."
"A survey of thermal and nonthermal effects is presented with some recommendations for future work. A basis of all biophysical considerations are the electrical properties including dielectric constants and conductivities for nearly all body tissues. Equations are presented which summarize previous experimental work and state dielectric constant and conductivity for tissues of high water content as functions of macromolecular content and frequency. No evidence is available supporting resonance behavior. Previous thermal work includes determination of depth of penetration values and the relative absorption cross section of man and was the basis for present standards. Nonthermal principles which explain many previous observations are largely due to field-induced forces. Such effects occur in the human body only at field-strength levels which are thermally dangerous. Several important conclusions are made. 1) Field-force effects cannot be enhanced by use of pulsed fields. 2) It is not possible to directly stimulate nerve membranes by microwave fields. 3) It is fluids and tissues. Finally, a guideline for future standard work in complex fields is proposed. It is based on the concept of a tolerance current density, which is stated to be near 3 mA/cm/sup 2/ between 1 and 1000 MHz. The biophysical principles which pertain to the interaction of nonionizing electromagnetic radiations with biological systems are not discussed. This was done in the past on several occasions. The field will be summarized only briefly and attention will be given to problems not already delt with satisfactorily. We intend to concentrate on some topics that are presently of particular interest."
"In recent years it has been recognized that low-power-density modulated RF energy can affect the functioning of higher living organisms. In this paper the sparse data generated in the western hemisphere on this subject are considered, the reasons for their sparseness are noted, and the hypotheses on mechanisms that may provide an explanation for the observed effects and other possible effects are sketched. Possible conclusions with regard to hazards to personnel are then considered."
"Research in Eastern Europe on biological effects of microwaves is briefly reviewed and a basic viewpoint involving non-thermal and cumulative effects is presented. Safety standards expressed in terms of dose or irradiation are described based on this viewpoint. It is suggested that differences between these standards and those in the West may become smaller with further study and closer collaboration between researchers in this field."
"Soviet studies have reported that low-level microwave irradiation alters the heart rate of humans and animals. In a replication of one such study, 16 rabbits were exposed to dorsal irradiation n of the head by 2.4-GHz CW. microwaves at a power density of 10 mW /cm/sup 2/ for 20 min. The rest of the animal's body was shielded by absorbent material. There was no significant difference between the heart rate during or after irradiation and the heart rate of the same animals during a control condition in which they were not irradiated. Analysis of the variability in heart rate observed in this experiment suggested that the heart-rate effects reported in the original Soviet study might have been chance variations. In a second experiment, heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature were recorded simultaneously while each of two rabbits was irradiated as before, on the dorsal aspect of the head only, at various power densities from 0 to 100 mW/cm/sup2/, in steps of 20 mW/cm/sup 2/. Respiration rate increased during irradiation at 40 mW/cm/sup 2/, body temperature rose at 80 mW/ cm/sup 2/, and ultimately the heart rate also increased, but only at 100 mW/cm/sup 2/."
"Several investigators have reported experiments in which microwave radiation caused biological damage at tissue temperatures which were not harmful when brought about by means other than microwaves. To study the effects of 10-GHZ CW radiation on a poikilothermic invertebrate animal, we irradiated early pupae of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. Each pupa was inserted in a waveguide and irradiated therein at waveguide powers of 80 mW for either 20 or 30 min or at 20 mW for 120 min, after which their subsequent development was observed. In control groups similarly treated, except that no microwave power was applied, 90 percent metamorphosed to become normal adult beetles. In the irradiated groups only 24 percent developed normally; 25 percent died and 51 percent developed abnormally. In half of the abnormal animals, the front half had undergone metamorphosis to form a normal beetle head and thorax but the hind part remained in the pupal state. Temperature increases within pupae were recorded during irradiation. When these thermal conditions were duplicated by means of radiant heating, subsequent development of pupae was normal in 80 percent of the experiments. We therefore concluded that the abnormalities induced by microwave radiation were not a thermal effect."
"As commonly recognized, the problem of quantifying hazardous electromagnetic (EM) fields is difficult and has not yet been satisfactorily solved. Essentially, this is because people are often exposed to emanations from powerful sources of EM fields at points close to the sources and at points where arbitrary polarization and multipath interference exist. However, the accepted concepts, standards, and most measuring instrumentation are based on simple plane-wave field propagation and so are inadequate for complicated fields. The complications and problems of quantifying hazardous EM fields involving source-subject coupling, reactive near-field components, multipath components, and arbitrary polarization are examined in some detail General discussion of dosimetric measurements and hazard survey measurements is given, and also some basic considerations for the design of field probes for these measurements. Recommendations are given for suitable parameters for quantifying complicated EM fields, and essential and desirable characteristics for hazard survey meters are stated. Several recently designed hazard survey probes are capable of measuring these recommended parameters in many complicated fields of interest, and improved instruments are anticipated."
"The induced fields and the static heating patterns within a multilayered spherical model that approximates the primate cranial structure irradiated by plane waves in the microwave spectrum are calculated. The relation of the model to the biological structure and the sensitivity of the results to the uncertainties in the dimensions and electrical properties of biological material are investigated. A method of solution for both the scattered and the interior fields for a sphere with an arbitrary number of electrically different concentric layers is developed in a form readily amenable to machine computation. It is shown that the semi-infinite slab model is inappropriate for calculating the microwave radiation dosage for the human head and similar structures."
"In investigating the biological effects of microwave radiation, one of the most vexing problems is that of generating an essentially uniform plane wave with sufficient power density for illuminating biological samples. This paper describes three illumination systems: a focused prolate spheroid, an absorber-lined horn, and a compact range. The focused prolate spheroid has two foci: a waveguide feed is located at one, and the biological sample is located at the other. Large power densities can be obtained over an area of about one square wavelength. The absorber-limed horn acts as a small source within an anechoic chamber; such an illumination system reduces errors due to interaction with the biological sample. The compact range employs a reflector and feed system to generate a plane wave across a large aperture; such a range is an attractive device for illuminating large volumes. All three systems can be implemented in a limited space without an anechoic chamber. Experimental data obtained from model systems are presented."
"One of the most vexing problems in studies involving the interaction of electromagnetic fields and living biological systems and tissues is the quantification of the fields induced in the tissues by nearby sources. This paper describes a method for rapid evaluation of these fields in tissues of arbitrary shape and characteristics when they are exposed to various sources including plane wave, aperture, slot, and dipole sources. The method, valid for both far- and near-zone fields, involves the use of a thermograph camera for recording temperature disitributions produced by energy absorption in phantom models of the tissue structures. The magnitude of the electric field may then be obtained anywhere on the model as a function of the square root of the magnitude of the calculated heating pattern. The phantoms are composed of materials with dielectric and geometric properties identical to the tissue structures which they represent. The validity of the technique is verified by comparing the results of the experimental approach with the theoretical results obtained for the case of plane layers of tissue exposed to a rectangular aperture source and cylindrical layers of tissue exposed to a plane-wave source. This technique has been used successfully by the author for improving microwave applicators."
"Expressions are derived and evaluated for the electro-magnetic fields and associated relative heating patterns in two-Iayered biological tissue media exposed to a direct-contact rectangular aperture source. The source consists of a linearly polarized electric field distribution specified in the plane of the aperture. The results may be used for many biomedical applications ranging from the design of diathermy applicators to the establishment of standardized electromagnetic field intensities in connection with research on electromagnetic effects in living biological media."
"Microwave heating of phantom models of human limbs by aperture sources is investigated theoretically and experimentally. These phantom models consist of triple-layered circular lossy dielectric cylinders. The three layers of dielectric materials simulate human tissues of fat, muscle, and bone. In the theoretical investigation, apertures operating in the frequency range of 433 to 2450 MHz are used as microwave sources for heating the dielectric materials. The theoretical investigation makes use of the technique of summation of cylindrical waves. A high-speed computer is used to calculate the numerical results. For the experimental investigation, an aperture is designed and built to operate at the frequency of 918 MHz. The resulting temperature patterns in the phantom models are detected by the use of a thermograph camera. The theoretical results are shown to be in agreement with the experimental results. The technique and results of this investigation may be applied towards the design of applicators for therapeutic heating of human tissues."
"A qualitative description of the way that the problems of radio frequency and microwave radiation hazards to personnel aboard Naval ships have been handled is presented. The prediction and measurement of microwave fields produced by typical equipment used for communication, command and control, surveilance, fire control, and naviagtion are discussed. A hazard evaluation survey conducted aboard a fictitious ship, which closely parallels that performed on actual ships, is described. Mentioned are the various methods and techniques used to define and control the potentially hazardous environment which is unique to the Navy."
"A technique for heating tumors with microwave energy has been developed to achieve differential hypothermia in laboratory animals. In the differential hypothermia technique, a temperature difference of about 25/spl deg/C is maintained between the tumor and the body with the tumor being at normal body temperature. While the animal is in this deep differential hypothermic state, chemotherapeutic drugs are administered to treat the tumor. For large tumors, the technique was implemented with S-band equipment and for smaller tumors it was implemented with X-band equipment. Both systems employ a feed or probe designed for use with the particular system. Results are presented that show the applicability of microwave energy in the selective heating of tumors."
"In an attempt to determine whether environmental control would be a feasible and effective tool with which to further investigate microwave bioeffects, we have performed a pilot study. Osborne-Mendel rats were exposed in a Iucite environmental chamber, continually flushed with liquid-nitrogen-cooled air. The results of this study indicate that ambient air temperature control can provide a means for prolonging life in test subjects exposed to high-intensity microwave fields. Dosimetric considerations are presented in an attempt to relate heating curves to exposure conditions."
"This book, by the Russian biophysicist who has been a leader in the study of the effects of electromagnetic fields on living organisms, is less practically and more scientifically oriented and as such will be of primary interest to research scientists, particularly well-heeled ones. Presman is not specifically concerned with microwaves or radio waves and still less with standards establishing maximum permissible values. Rather, much of the text is taken up with experimental investigations of the biological action of electromagnetic fields, notably studies originating in the Soviet Union, but his report is more in the nature of a catalog than of a critical review. As may be expected, considerable attention is given to the \"role of electromagnetic fields in the regulation of the vital activity of organisms:\" four chapters treating such diverse subjects as the relationship between biological phenomena and solar activity, electromagnetic regulation systems in living organisms, and parapsychological investigations. The reader who has heard that Soviet scientists have accumulated vast evidence of adverse effects of nonionizing radiation on the central nervous system of man will be disappointed by Presman's account of this topic which consists mainly of a report on some animal experiments and a reference to Kholodov's 1966 monograph (in Russian) on such effects. One might almost suspect that Presman has not been overly impressed by his countrymen's data and has decided to soft-pedal their conclusions, lest they be too critically scrutinized by English-speaking readers."
 "A radiation meter has been designed for the measurement of leakage from microwave ovens. A brief description of the meter is presented together with characteristics which suggest that the instrument has measurement applications other than that for which it was specifically designed. Some of the characteristics presented are geometry, temperature effects, frequency sensitivity, and conversion from calibrated power density to energy density."
"The production of cataract by exposure to microwave radiation can occur, although just how it occurs is not well established. Clarification as to the occurrence of cataract in microwave worker population can only be achieved by careful cumulative records of the visual and ophthalmological status of microwave worker populations."

"The design theory and experimental results of a proposed broad-band technique of an isolator are presented. The isolator not only has a broad-band backward loss but also a low broad-band insertion loss. The network constants and the performance are obtained in connection with the magnetic loss of ferrite, and they are confirmed by experimental data. The trial ultrawide-band isolator the performance of 20-dB isolation over the frequency band from 70 MHz to 800 MHz."
"A method for coupling an optical beam into thin films utilizing shaped tunneling regions is described. It is shown that in principle all of the power can be coupled into the film. For ease of fabrication, a uniform gradient structure is preferable, however, and yields coupling of over 90 percent for incident coherent Gaussian beams. Experimental coupling values with gradient tunneling regions are in excess of 50 percent. Good mode isolation and elimination of prism edge effects are major features of the coupler. The experimental coupling values are obtained from a transmission measurement utilizing two prisms."
"Propagation along periodic arrays of dielectric slabs in the direction transverse to that of periodicity is studied as a function of the prescribed phase delay per period for two polarizations. Classification of modes is achieved with the help of \"stability diagrams.\" In contrast with previous work, the rigorous dispersion relation and exact mode functions are considered. Calculated dispersion curves and closed form mode functions serve to illustrate the guiding properties of the structure and are, in turn, explained in terms of stability diagrams and equivalent networks."
"An interferometric polarization analyzer for measuring the microwave magneto-Kerr effect in semiconductors is described and analyzed, and compared with earlier systems used for the same purpose. The system described utilizes a 4-port waveguide junction referred to as a dual-mode transducer (DMT). This system has important advantages over systems previously used to measure the microwave magneto-Kerr effect. Preliminary data taken with the system are presented and sources of error discussed."
"A design theory for evanescent dominant mode waveguide filters is presented. The cutoff guide is represented by its equivalent /spl pi/-section network, the elements of which closely approximate lumped inductances. Resonators may be formed by introducing appropriate capacitive obstacles at suitable intervals along the guide. The filter that results is a microwave analog of lumped inductance filters with series inductance coupling, the magnitude of the series \"inductance\" being controlled by the separation between capacitive obstacles. The theory derives the equivalent ladder network from the low-pass prototype and is accurate up to at least 20 percent band-widths. Filters may be designed to couple into other cutoff waveguide components using the same basic principles, a propagating guide, and coaxial terminations. The filters are normally constructed in standard production waveguide and are simple and cheap to manufacture. A considerable size and weight reduction, compared with orthodox waveguide filters, is possible at the cost of a small increase in insertion loss."
"The cylindrical reentering cavity is studied. It is shown how lumped equivalent parameters can be known that are one inductance and two capacitances. These elements can be measured experimentally. Thus the problem of coupling with an active solid-state element, defined itself by lumped equivalent parameters (inductances and capacitances), is accurately solved."
"E-plane ferrite resonance isolators are commonly used in most medium-power waveguide systems, allowing to effectively decouple successive stages. The study of propagation in this type of structure leads to a set of transcendental equations, for which exact theoretical results have not been available so far. The design of these devices has been done experimentally, which is time consuming and does not allow for achievement of optimal performance due to the large number of parameters involved. The present study considers the TE/sub m0/, modes in an isolator structure. A matrix formalism is used to derive the dispersion relation, which is then solved with the help of a computer program. Experimental results for a simple structure show good agreement with the computed values. The influence of ferrite parameters on the isolation and forward losses is presented. Higher order modes in the structure and the methods to avoid them are discussed. Finally, the field distribution in the device is determined, showing a large concentration of the fields within the loading material."
"A method has been developed to optimize the geometry of the structure and the permittivity of the dielectric material used in E-plane isolators, for an arbitrary ferrite material. The structure is first computer analyzed, using an exact analytical approach. The minimum isolation and the maximum forward attenuation per unit length are calculated within a specified frequency band. The objective function, defined as the ratio minimum isolation per maximum forward losses, is then maximized. Several optimization procedures are compared and tested; the optimum gradient method was found to be well suited to this problem. Various optimized results are presented."
"The temperature stability of the oscillation frequency, (/spl Delta//spl omega/ / /spl omega/)/ /spl Delta/T, of an S-band feedback oscillator is derived in terms of the temperature stability of the stable resonator and that of the circuits external to the resonator. Conditions have been established for the optimum external circuit to achieve temperature stability of the oscillation frequency."
"The effect of inverse-squared frequency dependence of the apparent resistance of varactor diodes is discussed in the optimization of the noise figure of negative resistance and up-converter parametric amplifiers. Optimum idler frequency for a given signal frequency for minimum noise figure is calculated. It is also shown that about twofold improvement in the noise figure is obtained if the proper idler frequency is used for negative resistance amplifiers. It is also shown that the value of the optimum loading changes for upconverter amplifiers."
"A low dispersion YIG line was reported by Kirchner, Olson, and Bennet for which the delay was mechanically variable. A low dispersion YIG line, for which the delay is electronically variable, is described. A brief analysis is presented which determines the required magnetic field gradient needed to achieve objective dispersion characteristics. Approaches toward achieving the required field gradient are described. The resulting dispersion, almost constant and less than one-third of the typical dispersion for larger delays, is compared in detail with typical YIG line dispersion characteristics."
"A simple tuning circuit for source or load matching is described that makes possible smooth and sensitive adjustments with no \"holes\" in frequency coverage over a complete waveguide band. Energy is coupled out of the mainline, the phase and magnitude adjusted with phase shifter and attenuator and fed back into the mainline to cancel the reflected signal. A simple analysis of the circuit is presented, and a graph given for estimating the maximum voltage standing-wave (VSWR) that can be \"tuned out.\" Application to measurement of reflection coefficient or to impedance is proposed."
"The \"variational\" formula established by Champlin is replaced in a general formulation of linear equations and adjoint equations. It is shown not to be stationary about the true guided fields."
"Hg was removed from most of the positive column of an F13T5 lamp by cataphoresis; the Hg was trapped in the cathode region by cooling the bulb with ice. Noise temperatures were measured in the region of the lamp in which only an Ar discharge at 4.5 mmHg was taking place. The excess noise of the Ar discharge is given as a function of the dc discharge current from 60 to 2510 mA. An excessively large amount of noise that increased with discharge current was found to exist in the Hg portion of the discharge in the cathode region of some of the lamps. In some cases, this noise was coupled into the Ar discharge region and caused an apparent increase in the Ar noise temperature."
 "This section of the IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques carries descriptions of computer programs which have specific relevance to the microwave art and are available to the microwave community. The purpose of Computer Program Descriptions is to provide a means by which microwave engineers may share useful computer programs with their colleagues.

"Since Fox introduced the concept of \"differential phase shift\"(DPS) sections in TE/sub 11/ mode cylindrical waveguide, most interest has been concentrated on devices having fixed DPS of 90/spl deg/ or 180/spl deg/. This paper gives exact solutions for the magnitude, phase, and polarization of the wave output from three sections having variable DPS and orientations. The RF field is, successively resolved into components along the birefringence axes. Experimental results of tests carried out at X band, using a transversely magnetized ferrite tube, closely support the theory. It is shown how the latter can be applied, not only to familiar devices such as the rotary phase shifter or single sideband modulator, but also to new devices using ferrite sections of variable DPS or of switchable birefringence axes. A three-section power divider and attenuator is explained, together with a new two-section polarizer, with possible applications to satellites and search RADAR. It is also shown how one section can be used as a phase shifter. Some experimental results are given. Thus complete characterization of DPS section devices is offered by the theory, together with the quantitative effect of any of their parameters."
"The locking phenomenon of a driven oscillator has been studied by many authors. Huntoon and Weiss have characterized it by their locking signatures. It is also known that the difference phase of an oscillator and that of a phase-locked-loop (PLL) obey the same differential equation. In this paper a PLL configuration is obtained which yields the same locking signatures as those for the oscillator. Thus the equivalence between the oscillator and the PLL model is established both in terms of Iocking signature as well as in terms of frequency behavior. Since the nonlinear equations describing the oscillator and PLL model are identical, any static or dynamic results which apply to one also apply to the other. In systems containing oscillators, each oscillator maybe replaced by its equivalent PLL model so that the system may be analyzed more easily. For example, the locking-signature shape and the Iocking bandwidth of two coupled oscillators are given in terms of parameters which are easy to measure. In a second example, results are presented which describe the performance of an oscillator which is frequency modulated by a feedback signal. It is found that the signature shape and locking bandwidth may be set to any desired value by the proper choice of feedback parameters. Experimental results are presented which verify the theoretical results."
"Broad-banding of a circulator and changing of operation frequency of a lumped-element circulator are discussed. The point of broad-banding is to represent the circulator in a distributed element equivalent circuit. The improvement of the relative bandwidth was between 10 and 20 percent. The point of changing of operation frequency is to use a variable capacitance diode instead of a fixed one. The result is that the operating frequency changed from 120 to 220 MHz with a bias voltage change from 2 to 10 V."
"A technique is described for synthesis of coaxial bandpass filters based on an improved design of impedance inverters. This technique is applicable to filters having bandwidths between approximately 1 percent and 20 percent of the center frequency. The inverter used to realize the filters is a section of either low-Z/sub 0/ line or high-Z/sub 0/ line and is synthesized as a distributed element rather than as a lumped shunt capacitance or lumped series inductance, respectively. Three methods of accommodating the discontinuity capacitance associated with an abrupt change in the characteristic impedance are reviewed. The first two methods are most useful for filters with a fractional bandwidth/spl gsim/ 10 percent and the third for a fractional bandwidths /spl lsim/10 percent. Numerical and experimental verification of the design procedure is provided."
"Tables of normalized lumped lossless two-section impedance matching networks, which closely approximate -4, -5, and -6 dB per octave attenuation versus frequency characteristics are provided. Impedance transformation ratios vary from 20:1 to 100:1. Bandwidths range from 30 to 67 percent. The networks are particularly suited to broad-banding of RF power transistor stages. Measured performance of a 12-W, 225-400-MHz transistor stage illustrates application of the designs."
"Part I of this work investigates the phenomenon of mode reordering in circular waveguides containing one or more dielectrics. Specifically, conditions are established, be they ranges of dimensions, dielectric constants, or frequency, under which the sequence, TM/sub 01/, TE/sub 01/, TE/sub 11/, and TE/sub 21/ is obtained instead of the conventional TE/sub 11/, TM/sub 01/, TE/sub 21/, and TE/sub 01/. The desired effect is the reversal of the order of propagation between the normally dominant TE/sub 11/ mode and the circularly symmetric low-loss TE/sub 01/. Bandwidth regimes are drawn and the credibility of the dielectric model is examined and found to be satisfactory for the application of the phenomenon to the design of digital ferrite phase shifters operating in the TE/sub 01/ mode."
"The characteristics of the nonreciprocal phase shifter (phaser) configuration, consisting of a circumferentially magnetized circular toroid in circular waveguide, have been investigated theoretically. By suitably filling the toroid center with a material having a high dielectric constant, it is possible to reverse the normal order of the cutoff frequencies of the TE/sub 11/ and the operating TE/sub 01/ modes. The enhanced modal purity resulting from this inversion could yield significant improvements in the performance of practical phasers. The characteristic equation has been derived for the general case of a magnetized toroid in a circular waveguide, with dielectric material in both the central region and external to the toroid. The equation is valid for an arbitrary range of dielectric constants and magnetization. Differential phase shift calculations have been made specifically for operation within the modal inversion window. It is found that adequate differential phase shifts are obtained, even under the restrictions on geometric dimensions and range of dielectric constants imposed by the inversion requirements."
"The relations between the propagation constant and the frequency are derived for a waveguide filled with a simple moving medium. A set of dispersion curves is presented and some interesting propagation properties are derived from these dispersion curves."
"A simplified form of the coupling coefficient C(/spl beta//sub p/, /spl beta//sub q/) resulting from a coupled mode theory analysis of wave propagation in a nonuniform medium is derived. It is found for most situations of interest that C(/spl beta//sub p/, /spl beta//sub q/) is proportional to 1/(/spl beta//sub p/-/spl beta//sub q/) and the power transfer between two modes is proportional to 1/(/spl beta//sub p/ - /spl beta//sub q/)/sup 4/. /spl beta//sub p/ and /spl beta//sub q/ are the two different modal propagation constants. For a dielectric rod C(/spl beta//sub p/, /spl beta//sub q/) is a simple line integral around the rod boundary. Approximate forms are presented for optical waveguides."
"A new laser resonator is proposed in which a specified higher order Hermite-Gaussian mode becomes the lowest loss mode. The two reflectors in the resonator are blocked in the vicinity of the characteristic zeros of the mode and the edge (i.e., |x|, |y| /spl rlarr2/ /spl infin/). In such a configuration the mode volume is enhanced, and mode selection is improved as compared with a conventional resonator in which a Gaussian mode is the dominant one. We have specialized to TEM/sub 22/ mode. The solutions to the integral equation for the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the resonator are obtained on a digital computer. The computed eigenfunctions and mode selection show several interesting characteristics, and the loss mechanism for a few low-loss modes are elucidated. The computational results show that the location and the width of the blocking structure are closely related to the mode competition phenomenon and therefore mode selection."
"A technique for measuring the phase of millimeter signals in free space is described that uses a reference signal of varying phase. The phase of the reference signal is measured independently and subtracted from the total phase measured to determine the desired phase. The use of a varying reference phase is necessary because flexible or movable waveguide whose phase characteristics can readily be measured are not available at millimeter wavelengths. The theory of the technique described is based upon the interference pattern of slowly varying electric fields."
"A technique is presented to find the roots of low-pass equiripple insertion-loss functions realizable by commensurate line filters containing stubs as well as the unit elements. The technique is akin to closed form solution in that the roundoff errors of one root do not affect the rest of the roots. Results of a numerical example illustrate the practical advantage of this technique."
"An international intercomparison of microwave power at 3 GHz has recently been completed. This comparison was initiated at a meeting of the High Frequency Working Group of the Comite Consultatif d'Electricite (CCE) which met at the Bureau International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) in May, 1965. At that time, the U. S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) was designated as the pilot laboratory. The other laboratories, in the order of their participation, are the following: for Canada, National Research Council (NRC); for the U. S. S.R., All-Union Research Institute of Metrology imeni D. I. Mendeleyev (VNIIM); for the German Democratic Republic, Deutsches Amt fur Messwesen und Warenprufung (DAMW); and for Japan, the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL)."

 "The elements of the scattering matrix of a symmetrical waveguide junction are shown to transform in such a way that they may be treated as a tensorial set. When properly arranged, these elements carry the direct product representation {D(R) x D(R) } of the symmetry group of the junction. The number of independent elements in the scattering matrix is then determined by the number of times that the identity representation is contained in the direct product representation."

"Static capacitance characterizations are derived for coupled thin-film conductors in the suspended substrate geometry, which includes shielded microstrip as a special case. In particular, a satisfactory treatment of closely coupled and narrow lines is obtained where, because of the dominance of the edge singularity, \"mesh point\" analyses are inadequate. The present work was carried through to meet the need in interactive design procedures for characterization of a general transmission geometry. For these procedures, algorithms are required that take little storage and are suitable for very rapid calculations. Capacitance formulas are derived from variational series based on conformal transformations, and these series are converted to easily evaluated finite forms. Calculation of the even- and odd-mode fringing capacitances for coupled limes is made for finite line widths assuming a periodic array of lines. The applicability of these capacitances to a single pair of lines and to finite filter arrays has been checked experimentally. Routines for lower bound values of fringing capacitances are given. Upper bound formulations validate the accuracy of the lower bound calculations."
"Many types of coupled structures are used to design microwave filters and equalizers. One such structure is the array of coupled parallel commensurate conductors called a meander line. There are several analysis techniques that may be used to find the equivalent circuit of a meander line. However, these do not provide exact design equations. In this paper, meander-line networks are analyzed and synthesized using the graph-transformation technique. The equivalent circuits of one- and two-port meander-line networks will be developed by using the transformation method, and it will be shown that meander-line networks can be easily designed by using the electronic computer."
"An approximate analysis is presented together with a physical description of the modes of propagation in stripline and microstrip devices of significant width, using ferrite slabs as dielectric material, magnetized perpendicular to the ground plane. The dominant mode resembles TEM propagation, except that there is a strong transverse field displacement, causing wave energy to be concentrated along one edge of the line. Nonreciprocal behavior is obtainable by asymmetrically loading the edges. Approximate analytical techniques are given for isolators and phase shifters, with examples of numerical computations and experimental results."
"A computer-implemented procedure is presented for the design of optimally efficient dual-series feed networks for use in waveguide phased arrays where the network directional couplers are limited in their values of maximum coupling by geometrical and bandwidth requirements.

"The field description with spatial complex variables is proposed. The complex variables z, z/spl overbar/ are chosen, where z= x+iy and z/spl overbar/ is the complex conjugate. A contour integral in a complex plane is and the residue theorem is applied. The variables are changed by a transforming (mapping) function. The field description is applied to the boundary-value problems with arbitrary boundary. An approximate method is developed throughout this paper. It is pointed out that the integration can be performed easily and our analytical effort can be reduced. The two-dimensional scattered fields in free space from the perfectly conducting obstacle with arbitrary cross section are solved under assumption of small size. Furthermore the method is applied to the scattered fields in the rectangular waveguide with an inductive post or a capacitive post. The transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient are obtained in the general forms which involve the boundary parameters indicating the shape of the boundary."
"The reflection and transmission of a plane wave incident on a thin perfectly conducting screen perforated periodically with circular holes are considered. The spacings between holes may be comparable to or less than the wavelength. The metal screen is assumed to be either backed by a flat dielectric sheet, or sandwiched between two or more dielectric sheets that are used to match the susceptsnce of the screen. The techniques of transmission line analysis and the method of moments are employed to obtain a solution for this general class of boundary-value problems. Numerical results for several cases of interest in both X and Ku bands were obtained and shown to be in good agreement with experimental measurements."

"A computationally simple technique is presented for solving finite difference equations arising from potential problems, part of whose boundary is at infinity. The procedure makes use of an arbitrary \"fictitious\" boundary drawn close to the regions of physical interest. An initial guess is made of the potential on this boundary as well as at all interior points. Well-known iterative techniques are used to correct the values of the interior potentials. Meanwhile the potentials on the boundary are corrected iteratively by recalculating them from the sources or charges in the entire region, which in turn are calculated from the current iteration of the interior potential. The technique is valid even if parts of the physical structure, such as an air-dielectric interface in microstrip, extend toward infinity. The fictitious boundary need not include all of the structure, providing the rate of falloff of the sources outside the boundary is known."
"New approximate design equations for a class of microwave bandpass filters are presented. The filters are 1) dual forms of half-wave parallel-coupled resonator filters, 2) one form of interdigital filter, and 3) dual forms of direct-coupled stub filters. The advantages derived from using the new equations are 1) exact realization of the specified design bandwidth and 2) improved pass-band voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) response in the vicinity of band edge. Experiments data are presented for a trial filter design having 7 resonators, 40-percent bandwidth, and passband VSWR of 1.2."

As examples, the capacitance of open-circuited microstrip lines and the capacitance of rectangular microstrip sections are computed. The open-circuit data are basic to any three-dimensional problem. The method is a general one and can be used to compute the lumped capacitance of any microstrip discontinuity, such as bends and T junctions."
"In the millimeter-wave waveguide system considered for long-distance communication, the dispersive nature of the circular electric TE/sub 01/ mode can produce severe pulse distortion. To correct this problem, equalization of the guide delay distortion characteristic at the intermediate frequency is being considered.

"A numerical method is described for the solution of the electromagnetic fields in dielectric loaded waveguides. The method uses the cutoff modes of the waveguide, obtained by finite-element analysis, to determine by matrix methods the fields above cutoff. A theoretical comparison with the conventional finite-element method is given and a general, highly efficient computer program for the analysis of dielectric loaded waveguides by the new method is described. Dispersion curves and contour plots obtained from the program are shown for several geometrical configurations, and these results are compared with analytic values and those obtained by the conventional finite-element method."
"The device considered in this study is a semiconductor isolator consisting of a circular waveguide with a cylindrical rod of n-type InSb mounted coaxially in the guide. To achieve nonreciprocal operation, the InSb was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, a dc magnetic field was applied parallel to the direction of propagation, and a circularly polarized signal was used to excite the waveguide containing the rod. The pertinent solution of Maxwell's equations was programmed for a digital computer to allow numerical evaluation of the characteristics of the isolator using an InSb rod in which losses were present. Experimental data for various parameters and the corresponding calculated data are presented and compared. Low forward loss is achieved with the present coaxial geometry because of strong power concentration effects within or outside of the InSb rod as a function of the direction of propagation. Two series of calculated mode patterns are presented that demonstrate two types of operation of the isolator in achieving a high loss for one direction of propagation, one depending on field displacement, the other on mode coupling. These data are again compared to the experimental evidence."
"A method of evaluating the microwave dielectric properties of any geometrically defined sample is described by general theory and through experimental verification. The typical mathematical relations that describe specimen loss tangent by cavity methods are uniquely modified through inclusion of the derivative of cavity resonant frequency with respect to dielectric constant of the material comprising the particular configuration studied. The dielectric modules under study need not meet the small volume requirements demanded by perturbation theory; they may even occupy a very large volume of the cavity. A particular advantage of the described evaluation technique is the continuity of use of a given dielectric specimen for tests at microwave frequencies, without geometric alteration, after its properties at lower frequencies have been determined."
"A general and rigorous formulation of the scattering by a dc magnetized ferrimagnetic cylinder in a rectangular waveguide is derived. This formulation leads to an approximate solution whose error can be quantitatively estimated. As an example, the case in which the ferrimagnetic cylinder is centrally placed is solved. It is shown that previously existing approximate solutions are not valid for the resonant situation in view of their accuracy."
"The convergence of numerical solutions of several iris-type discontinuity problems in waveguides and periodic structures is investigated. It is demonstrated that the numerical solution of a set of equations obtained from a mode-matching procedure (which corresponds to an integral equation formulation of the problem generally known as the moment method) may converge to an incorrect value if an improper ratio is chosen between the number of modal terms in the aperture and the number of terms retained in the kernel of the integral equation. Guidelines for efficient numerical computations are indicated."

"An inversion procedure, based on the methods used in proving Burmann's theorem, is used to provide an integral expression which exhibits the form of the electrostatic field explicitly in terms of the field coordinates. The method is illustrated with an example of a stepped-guide junction. The form of the field and the expression for the mode expansion coefficients are examined. The results are related to the companion problem of solving for the transverse field from a singular integral equation formulation. The two methods agree in the particular case of a two-to-one step for which special simplifications are possible. In the general case, progress in the solution of a class of double-kernel integral equations may be expected through the indirect use of the inversion of the solution obtained from the conformal transformation methods."

 "The shielded microstrip on a ferrite substrate transversely magnetized in the plane of the substrate is analyzed using an appropriate modal expansion in each of the two media. The boundary conditions at the interface are then expressed in terms of two coupled integral equations which are subsequently solved by the method of moments. Information on the singularities in the fields near the edges is used in the computations to obtain the eigenvalue /spl beta/ within an estimated 0.5-percent accuracy using matrices as small as 5x5. Comparison with various published results for the microstrip is made in the lid case of a dielectric substrate. An/spl omega/-/spl beta/ plot is presented for one particular ferrite-loaded configuration which shows slight non-reciprocity in both the fundamental and higher order modes."
"Tremendous technological strides have been made in recent years in the development of miniaturized microwave components and modules using microstrip transmission lines in combination with both semiconductor and ferrite technology. This technology growth has been spurred by rapidly increasing microwave systems complexity and diversity and the need for lower cost, more reliable, and smaller microwave assemblies. This paper describes the design and performance of various ferrimagnetic components as functional blocks for use in microwave integrated modules. The design and performance of the following components are described as well as their utilization in various multifunction modules: junction circulators both fixed bias and latching including their use as isolators, duplexers, switches, modulators, and other signal processing circuits; ferrimagnetic planar phase shifters; various combinations of these circuit elements where both all ferrimagnetic and composite ferrimagnetic/dielectric substrates are utilized."
"The use of lumped elements in microwave integrated circuits (MICS) is discussed. The design, fabrication, and performance of networks used in both active and passive circuits are described. Studies on amplifier impedance matching and transforming networks have resulted in the achievement of a 35-dB-gain 6-W-CW 26-percent-efficient amplifier at 2.25 GHz using only lumped elements. Construction of lumped-element low-pass filters and 3-dB quadrature hybrids at S band have produced circuits much smaller than, but with performance comparable to, microstrip distributed circuits. At C band a large-impedance transformer operating as a filter had less than 0.4-dB loss for an impedance transformation close to 20:1. The performance of lumped-element circuits through X band is compared with that of distributed circuits from the standpoint of size, economy, and technological applications. Lumped-element circuits are competitive with distributed circuits through 6 GHz and are practical through 12 GHz."
"The development of an integrated low-noise sweeping superheterodyne receiver is described. Based upon a receiver performance tradeoff study, a group of components were designed and integrated within a single housing occupying 5.9 in/sup 3/, less connectors. The integrated receiver weighs 6.4 oz, including magnets, and contains the following components: a wide-band low-noise tunnel-diode amplifer (TDA), an image-rejection balanced mixer, a varactor-tuned Gunn oscillator, a four-stage IF amplifier, and a quasi-complementary IF output filter. The housing also contains an interstage ferrite isolator, a bias distribution network with subminiature potentiometers, and a branch-line coupler. This coupler permits the injection of an external oscillator and allows the system to be evaluated outside the band covered by the internal Gunn oscillator. This receiver is the first kind to integrate within a minimum volume all the components necessary for a wide-band low-noise rapid-scan X-band imageless superheterodyne receiver. Varactor tuning permitted the entire receiver to be integrated in a package having about one fifth the weight and two fifths the volume of other similar receiver designs (e.g., a receiver utilizing a YIG-tuned oscillator)."

The module uses transistor chips mounted on a carrier designed for stripline applications. Seventeen units were constructed and representative test data are presented. Phase matching of /spl plus mn/ 15/spl deg/ was obtained between a group of modules by use of compensating lengths of lines attached to the outputs."
"The construction of pulsed microstrip Gunn diode transmitters which deliver 5-10 W at 9.4 GHz is described. The oscillators are designed to be used as injection locked elements in a simple phased array system; the necessary phase stability against ambient and in-pulse temperature change being achieved by suitably biasing a varactor diode. Details of the design and performance of the transmitter and its component parts are presented together with preliminary data on a small array."
"A microwave integrated circuit (MIC) front end which satisfies stringent environmental and filtering requirements has been developed; the design objectives were based on the requirements typical of an L-band receiver for an identification friend or foe (IFF) transponder. The front end includes a preselector, a balanced mixer, and a multiplier for providing the local oscillator (LO) signal. A compact low-loss design has been achieved for the bandpass filter portion of the preselector through the use of \"hairpin\" resonators. Use of a semilumped 3-dB coupler has resulted in a significant reduction in the size of the mixer. The front-end noise figure was measured to be 10.4 dB at room temperature, with a maximum of 14.0 dB at 125/spl deg/C. All spurious responses were measured to be more than 80 dB down, and LO reradiation was -67 dBm. Dynamic range was greater than 70 dB."
"Techniques employed for Ku-band hybrid integrated microstrip components are discussed along with their performance data. The final integration results in a complete monopulse receiver with its own electronically tunable Gunn oscillator in a total packaged volume of 2.1 in/sup 3/. Materials and their limitations are discussed. Electronically tunable Gunn oscillator performance at Ku band is demonstrated which leads finally to a brief discussion of the dynamic impedance properties of negative resistance diodes."
"We have calculated the conversion loss for microwave diode mixers taking into account the effects of series resistance and barrier capacitance in the diode and the internal resistance of the local oscillator. The relations between the conversion loss and the parameters, which are important for the design of the diode mixer, are clarified. A 4-GHz integrated-circuit low-noise mixer is developed. The minimum overall noise figure obtained is 4.1 dB with a short-circuited image-frequency termination."
"An integrated balanced mixer for use in the receiver for the quasi-millimeter-wave digital radio transmission system is described. The following aspects of the mixer realization are discussed. 1) The characteristics of gallium arsenide Schottky barrier diodes and three types of diode mount construction are described. The least observed dc incremental conversion loss was about 4 dB in the range of 18-23 GHz. 2) The fabrication of waveguide to microstrip transition, using a ridged waveguide transducer, is described. A transition loss of less than 0.38 dB was obtained in the range of 18-21.75 GHz. 3) The microstrip circuit elements, such as the 3-dB directional coupler and the low-pass filter, are described. The minimum isolation and coupling values of the coupler were about 16 dB and 3-4 dB, respectively. 4) The effect of the undesirable electromagnetic mode propagation on the integrated mixer operations is discussed. 5) The performance of the integrated balanced mixer is presented. This mixer, operated at a signal frequency of 20 /spl plus mn/0.5 GHz and at a local oscillator frequency of 18.3 GHz, showed a single side-band noise figure of 4.8-5.8 dB. 6) The reliability of the mixer is also evaluated with high reliability under vibration and shock testing being exhibited."
"Design of bandpass filters for microwave integrated circuits (MICS) utilizing dielectric resonators is discussed. Synthesis methods for both Tschebycheff and Butterworth responses are derived. Experimental results with S- and X-band filters are presented, and the agreement between theory and experiments is shown to be fairly good. Limitations on this technique due to poor temperature stability are also discussed."
"A reliable method of tuning and microwave integrated circuit (MIC) line connection which has potential up to X band has been demonstrated. The method utilizes integrable fabricated microcantilever air gaps which are cold-deformed in situ to accomplish trimming. The advantages of this concept are 1) high open-circuit impedance, 2) low short-circuit insertion loss, 3) high trim resolution, 4) low line perturbation, 5) high mechanical stability, and 6) in situ fabrication with the rest of MIC circuitry."
"A single-pole double-throw (SPDT) microstrip switch has been designed on a plastic (polyolefin) substrate to switch two 10-W CW carriers into a common load over the frequency range 1.7 to 2.3 GHz. No tuning adjustments are used over this 30-percent bandwidth to obtain a 90-dB minimum isolation, a 23-dB minimum return loss, and a 1-dB maximum insertion loss. Units now in production typically have a 0.6-dB insertion loss, a 26-dB return loss, and isolation levels of 105/spl plus mn/5 dB."
"A new two-diode single-pole double-throw (SPDT) power-switch with the operating frequency adjustable within one octave is presented. An experimental model of the switch showed frequency adjustments in narrow bandwidth operation between 0.65 and 1.3 GHz. Frequency adjustment is made by appropriately short-circuiting a transmission line. Using thin-film microstrip lines, the switch was buitt on a 50-mil-thick 1-in by 1-in A1/sub 2/O/sub 3/ ceramic substrate. Switching speed is 100 to 300 ns; power handling capability is 1.5-kW peak power at 1-percent duty factor."
"Wide-band quadrature hybrid proximity couplers consist of a conductor fabricated by thin-film techniques in microstrip the conductor side and a slot in the ground plane side. A 4 to 1 bandwidth was achieved using an alumina substrate of 99.6-percent purity with a surface finish of 10 /spl mu/in. A single-section quadrature hybrid has been fabricated and operates over a 2.5- to 10-GHz frequency range with a maximum VSWR of 1.43:1, a 20-dB typical isolation, and a phase difference between outputs of 90/spl deg/ /spl plus mn/ 3/spl deg/."
"Ferrite circulators, incorporated as integral parts of a microstrip circuit on a copper-clad dielectric substrate, have been developed and tested. These circulators do not require the machining of a hole in the dielectric substrate or etching of the ferrite metalization. 20-dB isolation bandwidths of 3.5 to 4 percent in the frequency range 1.75 to 2.23 GHz were measured."
"A 3-port inverted-microstrip circulator has been built which operates near 30 GHz with an isolation of greater than 20 dB over a 6-percent bandwidth. The circulator junction has an insertion loss of less than 0.4 dB over the band exclusive of losses in transitions used for testing the device."
"A method of determining the microwave dielectric constant of microwave integrated circuit substrates is described. The technique is especially suitable to substrates being prepared for MICs since they are, in general, regular, rectangular, and, therefore, simple resonators. The dielectric constant using this technique has been determined in the 2- to 12-GHz range for GaAs (/spl epsiv/R = 12.46), sapphire (/spl epsiv/R =9.37), polyguide (/spl epsiv/ =2.33), and Alsimag 772 (/spl epsiv/R = 10.08)."
"Microstrip circuits in metal enclosures frequently exhibit loss spikes. These spikes are sometimes shown to be related to cavity resonances whose frequency can be calculated from enclosure dimensions using known theory.

The formalism is based on a quantum mechanical VB principle for multichannel (multiport) scattering and is a first attempt to apply the VB method to a multi-mode problem. The procedure for determining the functions required in the application of the VB method is illustrated for a rectangular waveguide propagating two modes that are coupled by a dielectric obstacle."
"Synthesis procedures are presented for commensurate linelength combline and capacitively loaded interdigital filters. A simple modification for using lumped capacitors is given and is found to yield excellent results for any practical bandwidth. The synthesis procedures for both filter types follow directly from the classical bandpass filter design approach using a transformed frequency variable. Two design examples are given to illustrate the design procedures and experimental results are presented for a 40 percent bandwidth combline filter. The problems of network sensitivity, use of network equivalents, and extension to other filter types are also discussed."
"The AM and FM fluctuations in an oscillator output are originated from impedance fluctuation in low frequencies (baseband noise) and voltage or current fluctuation in the vicinity of the carrier frequency (RF noise). In this paper, from newly defined \"complex correlation coefficient between AM and FM noises,\" contributions of baseband and RF noises to the AM and FM noises are determined. Examples of data for X-band Gunn oscillators show that both the AM and FM noises are mainly caused by the baseband noise in the vicinity of the carrier frequency (within 1-kHz band), whereas they are mainly due to the RF noise at frequencies further than 10 kHz from the carrier frequency."
"The results of experimental and theoretical investigations of the noise characteristics of lMPATT diode amplifiers and oscillators are presented. The oscillator noise is shown to consist of three different contributions: modulation noise, selectively amplified primary noise, and conversion noise. The influence of the active device nonlinearity and load circuit parameters is discussed in detail. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. It is especially pointed out that the large correlation between AM and FM fluctuations, usually measured in IMPATT oscillators, indicates nonoptimum AM noise performance. Experimental techniques for achieving optimum AM noise performance are demonstrated (orthogonal noise tuning). By a simple extension of the model, the noise behavior of an injection phase-locked oscillator can be described. The calculated AM and FM noise power spectra for the synchronized oscillator are also shown to be in good agreement with experimental results. Finally the signal-to-noise ratio for current modulated IMPATT oscillators is investigated and optimization is demonstrated."
"The induced EMF method has been extended and applied to derive the driving-point impedance of a common waveguide structure used for mounting small microwave devices. An equivalent circuit is developed and discussed in detail. Theoretical impedance curves are presented demonstrating the circuit characteristics for various configurations of the mount. The driving-point impedance of this mount has also been considered experimentally. A novel measurement technique is used based upon the use of subminiature coaxial line to gain electrical access to the terminal pair located inside the waveguide. A model of the measurement circuit, which enhances the accuracy of the results, providing excellent agreement between the theoretical and measured values, is developed. The multilateral nature of the circuit allows consideration of the mount in the waveguide as an obstacle to any incident propagating mode. Some related measurements have been made using standard techniques for the H/sub 10/ mode. It is anticipated that this formulation will permit accurate design of many components which previously required empirical methods based on limited experimental data."
"The continuous modes for a circular dielectric rod are derived. These modes are identified with the fields due to the scattering of a plane wave at oblique incidence from a dielectric rod, thus providing insight into their behavior. This identification suggests that the modes be classified as incident transverse magnetic (ITM) modes when the incident plane-wave portion of H/sub z/ is zero and as incident transverse electric (ITE) modes when the incident plane-wave portion of E/sub z/ is zero. The transition region from discrete to continuous modes is analyzed in detail. Very simple approximate modes are derived for use in optical waveguide studies."

No tuning of the test mount is required, and the need for separate capacitance measurements is eliminated. A numerical data processing technique is illustrated which permits rapid determination of the Q from the measured data."
"A stripline phase shifter is described which yields a linear variable phase shift versus frequency. The phase shift is accomplished by varying the dielectric constant of the medium through which the signal propagates. Characteristic impedance is kept constant at all phase shift settings; hence, in theory, no reflections are produced. Measurements made over the 1 to 2 GHz band show the maximum voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) to be 1.15. Measured values of insertion phase shift over the same frequency band show good agreement with theory (maximum difference about 2.5 percent)."
"A low-inductance semiconductor device package has been fabricated for use in the microwave and millimeter-wave ranges where the parasitic resonances of conventional packages interfere with circuit design. This method of packaging eliminates the use of springs or ribbons normally used to contact the semiconductor and has resulted in a package in which the first self-resonance is calculated to be over 200 GHz. The package has been used successfully in several experimental applications over the past two years."

"Intermodulation distortion in abrupt-junction current-pumped varactor frequency converters is usually attributed to gain compression effects. In the present work an analytical procedure is formulated in which distortion generation and gain saturation effects are seen to arise as a consequence of the interaction of signals, pump, and generated products with the nonlinear capacitance of the varactor. Good agreement is demonstrated between predicted distortion levels and those measured in an experimental upper-sideband up-converter operating at VHF with low gain and high level drive to minimize gain compression effects."
"The class of filters considered here is such that with a prescribed numerator for the transducer power gain (a constant or (1/spl lambda//sup 2/)/sup r/) the available degrees of freedom are divided to provide some zero derivatives of delay and some zero derivatives of the amplitude response at the origin. This enables one to progress in a smooth fashion from the maximally flat amplitude response to the maximally flat delay response. The results are derived by starting from the key case where the numbers of zero derivatives in amplitude and delay are equal. Results are presented for all-stub, cascaded transmission line, and interdigital realizations, and it is indicated how the technique may be applied for any prescribed even numerator in the transducer power gain. The results obtained indicate that this class of functions is particularly suitable for relatively wide passbands."
"An active transversal filter concept for microwave frequencies is proposed. Silicon metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) with high impedances are used as active coupling elements. A hardware implementation yields a minimum interval between equalized pulses of 1.5 ns. Simulations with improved MESFETs predict equalization for smaller pulse intervals than 400 ps."
"The waveguide power-mode theorems derived earlier apply to lossless passive waveguide systems. These theorems are now extended in three ways. First, nonconservative (e.g., lossy or active) systems are treated. Second, the theorems are generalized to account for complex frequency. Third, plasmas and relativistic electron beams are included by considering the mechanical equations of this \"medium\" explicitly. It is found that in general, the propagation constants, attenuation constants, real power, and reactive power can all be interrelated. The pseudo-energy terms in general are complex."

"Historically it has been assumed that the microwave power per unit bandwidth radiated from the plasma of typical argon and neon gas discharge noise sources is frequency independent. There are now both a priori basis and experimental evidence for questioning this assumption. For such frequency independence to exist over a frequency range of 100 MHz to 100 GHz the following conditions must be met: (1) /spl planck/ /spl omega/ / kT<<1; (2) proper matching of the discharge to the guide; (3) an appropriate level of absorptivity of the plasma for these frequencies; (4) a Maxwellian electron velocity distribution function; and (5) absence of collective oscillations. The first three conditions are shown to be met. The fourth condition involves the concept of a radiation temperature. Because the appropriate electron velocity distributions are not Maxwellian this radiation temperature does depend somewhat on frequency. This dependence is limited to a small region around the electron-atom collision frequency. For the discharges of concern it is shown that these collision frequencies are 10/sup 9/ to 10/sup 10/s/sup -1/ and therefore contained in the frequency range of interest. The fifth condition relates to the fourth and recently has been shown in theory to be untrue. Finally there is now available experimental evidence which appears to show a small (0.2-0.3 dB) variation of excess noise ratio with frequency on existing tubes. Suggestions for future experiments and interim considerations are made."
"Equations are given from which the resonant frequencies of dielectric resonators can be calculated taking into account the influence of the conducting walls of the microwave structures in which these resonators are inserted. The comparison between theoretical and experimental results shows the validity of the theoretical model."

"A previously unpublished relationship is derived for the scattering coefficients of a passive Iossy nonreciprocal two-port. The relationship, in the form of an inequality, is a generalization of a result of Uhlir."
"A coaxial directional coupler has been developed which allows adjustment of the length of the coupling slot to /spl lambda//4 or 3/spl lambda//4 throughout the frequency range 0.3 to 8.5 GHz. Coupling is flat to within 0.05 dB from 0.3 to 3 GHz (/spl lambda//4 mode) and 0.1 dB from 0.9 to 8.5 GHz (3/spl lambda//4 mode). The coupler has 50-dB coupling, 30- to 40dB directivity and was designed primarily for high power measurement (1 to 1000 W) using a low-power meter on the sidearm. The VSWR for the two modes of operation is 1.02 to 1.05. Five octave bandwidth-type couplers would be required to cover this same frequency range."

"A tetrahedral waveguide junction type of switch has been developed for use in the millimeter region. The design employs a permanent magnet such that the switch operates in the transmission state without any external dc power. By applying a current pulse it switches from the transmission state to the reflective state in 400 ns and back to the transmission state in less than 200 ns. Over the frequency range of 95.5 to 97.2 GHz the switch exhibits a maximum insertion loss of 1.0 dB and a minimum isolation of 25 dB."

"The output power from 12 IMPATT diodes has been combined in a single-cavity multiple-device oscillator. The oscillator is free from the well-known moding problem of multiple-device oscillators. The objective of this paper is to present the oscillator-circuit theory, which clearly indicates why this particular circuit configuration can give a stable operation free from moding problems. To handle the formidable equations necessary for the analysis, the eigenfunction approach is extensively used. The condition for stable operation, the noise performance, and the locking behavior of the oscillator are all discussed. The noise performance is similar and the locking behavior identical to those of single-device oscillators."
"An attempt is made to determine some of the factors responsible for the noise performance of avalanche diodes. In particular we are interested whether there are any lower lids in the noise measure. We derive a theorem which shows that there is a lower limit M/sub opt/ = 1/2 q/ /spl alpha'/kT for an IMPATT diode which has a constant value of a', where M/sub opt/ is the optimum noise measure, q is the electronic charge, a' is the derivative with respect to the electric field of the carrier generation rate, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the standard absolute temperature. Even though the optimum noise measure is derived for a diode with constant a' in extensive numerical calculations of structures with sections of different a', we never found cases where the overall diode noise figure was lower than calculated by the above formula using the largest value of a'. Detailed calculations show that the lowest noise measure is achieved for carrier transit angles near 2/spl pi/. The negative real part of the impedance becomes rather small when both the transit angle is near 2/spl pi/ and when a' is made large. In practical cases it is therefore often not possible to reach noise measures close to M/sub opt/. The paper also investigates how the amplifier noise determines amplitude and frequency noise of the corresponding avalanche oscillators."
"A Monte Carlo Procedure is presented which can be used to solve electrostatic and TEM-mode transmission-line problems. A modification of the known Monte Carlo procedures is given, which makes it possible for the method to be used when the dielectric is inhomogenous. Two sources of error are investigated; a partial correction is given for one, and it is shown how the probability confidence limits for the other can be computed."
"Theoretical characteristics are presented for X-band 3-dB rat-race and branch-line couplers using gold microstrip lines with a semi-insulating GaAs dielectric. The rat-race configuration is shown to be less influenced by junction reactance and dimensional tolerances and has a greater bandwidth than the two-branch coupler. However, the rat-race coupler has the disadvantage that the output arms are not adjacent. Three-branch couplers are shown to have bandwidth comparable to the rat-race coupler but are much more sensitive to junction reactance and dimensional tolerances."
"In the case of lumped-element circulators, the center frequency of the device can be tuned by altering the lumped capacitance only. It is the purpose of this paper to describe a new voltage-tuned circulator which is obtained by replacing the usual lumped capacitances by varactor diodes. Such a circulator has been tuned over an octave band from 250 to 500 MHz."
"A new technique for measuring the dielectric constant and loss tangent of materials in the millimeter-wave range is described. The measurement apparatus and the analysis is considerably simpler than that using conventional techniques. The new technique is based upon a simple geometrical optics approximation, in which a plane reflector is rotated so as to maximize the transmitted-reflected wave power through the material. Only one microwave horn is used in the measurement."
"A single sideband modulator which frequency shifts a 10-GHz signal by 1 kHz and which suppresses the carrier and unwanted sideband by 65 dB and >57 dB, respectively, with respect to the wanted sideband, is described. The modulator comprises two commercially available double sideband modulators and a readily constructed high-pass filter. Using the modulator in one arm of a microwave bridge, phase shtits and changes in attenuation of <1/spl deg/ and 0.05 dB have been measured; the low modulating frequency allows audio-frequency circuitry to be used to measure the phase shift and attenuation."
"The azimuthally dependent magnetostatic modes have been investigated for two cases: 1) a hollow ferrite pipe is enclosed in a perfectly conducting wall; and 2) a ferrite rod is located at the center of a round waveguide, partially filling the cross section. Our analysis shows that the presence of the dielectric medium has an important role in the determination of the upper bound frequency and the cutoff wave number of the magnetostatic surface modes."
"The impedance and scattering properties of a perfectly conducting plane annulus surrounding a Goubau line is investigated.

"The accurate attenuation range of many precision rotary vane attenuators is limited to about 40 dB because of a transmission error term that is not accounted for in the familiar cos/sup 2//spl theta/ attenuation law. This paper presents a modified law that makes it possible to extend the useful dynamic attenuation range. The same modified law also makes it practical to reduce the length of the rotor section and, therefore, to develop compact rotary vane attenuators that are accurate over reduced dynamic attenuation ranges. The modified law requires the additional calibrations of the incremental attenuation and incremental phase change at the 90/spl deg/ vane angle setting. To verify the modified law, a precision compact WR 112 rotary vane attenuator was fabricated and tested. The attenuator has a total dynamic attenuation range of about 30 dB and a rotor section length approximately one-third that of a conventional WR 112 attenuator. Application of the modified law resulted in good agreement between theoretical and measured incremental attenuations over the total dynamic attenuation range."
"This paper discusses the way in which symmetry groups may be utilized in the analysis of periodic microwave structures. The theory of group representations is introduced, and the relationship of these representations to the vector electromagnetic fields which are solutions to the Helmholtz equation (subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the microwave structure) is briefly explained. Also explained is the concept of time reversal. Symmetry analysis involves collecting all of the symmetry operations of a microwave structure into a group, and then finding the irreducible representations of that group. Each solution of the Helmholtz equation must belong to an irreducible representation of the space group, and by examining the irreducible representations it is possible to determine the symmetries and degeneracies of the waves. Symmetry analysis is employed to describe some of the characteristics of the waves of the unsupported wire helix and of the single-wire helix supported symmetrically by three dielectric rods. In particular, the conditions for the occurrence of branch crossings on the k-/spl beta/ diagram are discussed."
"The capacitance coefficients for a system of irregular finite conductors on a dielectric sheet are considered. There are two parts to the Green's function-integral equation approach considered herein: the first deals with a derivation of Green's functions for a desired mathematical model; the second solves the integral equation by a discretization procedure in which a solution for a large number of unknowns is required-a significant limitation. This approach, however, allows treatment of rather complex finite geometric configurations that are useful in the design of modern thin-film circuits. An integral representation of the Green's functions for the desired mathematical model is presented in which ground planes are assumed at finite distances from the dielectric sheet. However, in this paper, final results are obtained only for the case in which ground planes are at infinity. Numerical results are presented for some typical multiconductor systems. For the case of a two-dimensional parallel strip problem, the result of the present analysis compares well with that available in the literature."
"A parallel-plate waveguide model for the microstrip line formed on the Si-SiO/sub 2/ system is analyzed theoretically and the results are compared with the experiment. The experiment has been performed over wide ranges of frequency, substrate resistivity, and strip width. Existence of three types of fundamental modes is concluded and the condition for the appearance of each mode is clarified. In particular, the slow-wave mode is found to propagate within the resistivity-frequency range suited to the monolithic circuit technology, and its propagation mechanism is discussed. Approximate analysis of the fringing effect is also made for the slow-wave mode."
"The problems of electromagnetic waves in moving isotropic or uniaxial mediums have been dealt with by numerous authors. Chawla and Unz considered the fields in a moving anisotropic plasma, and Chen and Cheng analyzed waves in an isotropic plasma in a moving dielectric medium. In this note we consider electromagnetic fields in a moving anisotropic medium and propose the network formulation of electromagnetic fields in the moving medium in the radial cylindrical coordinate. The method is an extension of the transmission line representation of electron beams on infinite magnetic fields. We can apply these results to the cases of any magnetic field intensity and, further, solve the complex problems for a stationary anisotropic plasma by a similar method."

"The analysis of a class of N-port TEM-mode hybrids, operating as equal or unequal power dividers or summers, has been extended to include the use of tapered transmission lines. The analysis indicates design limitations on the VSWR and isolation characteristics, and can be applied for arbitrary frequency bandwidth and/or power division ratios. Also included are design graphs and tables that cover some common ranges of power division/summation ratios."

 "The effects of thermal expansion incompatibility between silicon slices and various metal substrates are described for adhesive and solder joints. Dependable solder and adhesive joints have been achieved in mounting two-inch silicon slices. The size of the sillcon slices that can be solder or adhesive mounted to various substrates and withstand a specified temperature change was experimentally determined. Extrapolation of the present results can predict the suitability of substrate material for mounting larger than 2-in silicon slices. A one-dimensional theoretical model was found to describe the trends of the experimental data."
  "Friction and wear processes have a common origin at minute contact points where either cold welding or surface penetration and cutting occur. Wear can be classified roughly into four types: adhesive wear, abrasive wear, chemical wear, and galling wear. Consideration of the effect of load on real contact area leads to the principle that wear is proportional to the load and inversely proportional to the hardness of the softer of the sliding pair. Abrasive wear decreases to negligible amounts when the abraded surface approaches the hardness level of the abrasive. The mechanism of wear of ceramics is different from metals. It occurs by microfragmentation. Friction of dry surfaces is a function of shear strength of contact junctions and hardness. Friction is independent of apparent area of contact but is extremely sensitive to surface chemistry."
"The selection of a material for use can be simplified by listing the use-requirements/material-properties systematically so that a workable combination of properties can be found. The requirements are organized under the headings of mechanical, thermal, environmental, electrical, and economic. These generally in decreasing order of importance except where economic factors override."
"Solid lubricants technology is a burgeoning field that deserves the attention of the designer of machines and devices that will operate in ordinary as well as in extreme environments. This article describes solid lubrication processes, the mechanisms by which solid lubricants function, the properties of solid lubricants, and the materials involved in solid lubrication and techniques for their application. Self-lubricating composites containing solid lubricants are described, which are useful as maintenance-free gears, bearings, and commutator brushes. Reliability of solid lubrication and wear life of solid-film lubricants are being improved by designing machine elements specifically to employ solid lubricants and by careful matching of the solid lubricant with the substrate bearing material."
"Solenoids, relays, and other magnetically activated devices are frequently operated in modes that permit repeated impacting of an armature against a core. Such operation not only produces wear of the contacting faces but results in stresses that can change the magnetic behavior of the materials employed. The magnitude of this change was evaluated for typical core operation of grain-oriented silicon iron, 2 V-Permendur and Hipernik alloys. Hysteresis loop properties were measured at intervals during the operating sequence. Pronounced deterioration of structure-sensitive properties (permeability, residual induction, and coercive force) was observed in silicon iron and Hipernik with relatively little change noted in the 2 V-Permendur. The changes appear to be clearly related to the cumulative microdamage within the metal due to impact fatigue effects. The results indicate that significant property deterioration does result from repeated impacting and this may present a design limitation on the lifetime of devices having critical magnetic demands."
 "The ratio of primary inductance LM to stray inductance LS determines the relative bandwidth Br and the pulse response of the transformer. In order to reduce LS, a miniature coaxial cable, whose outside shield serves, e.g., as the primary winding and whose inside conductor serves as the secondary winding, can be used. The relative bandwidth Br of such a transformer is then limited mainly by the mutual capacitance between both windings. When a triaxial (shielded coaxial) cable is used instead of a coaxial cable and when the internal braid is used as a shield and connected so that it has the same instantaneous HF potential with respect to ground as the internal conductor, then the mutual capacitance is practically zero and a shielded HF transformer with a relative bandwidth well over 104can be constructed. This construction, which was developed for precise and fast pulse circuits, can be used whenever a floating pulse or wide-band HF signal source is needed."
"An experimental heat-transfer study was performed to obtain design criteria for totally enclosed electronic equipment. Tests were performed on an experimental cabinet containing nine sources simulating electronic devices, and results were obtained for different distributions of source locations and heat-flux levels. Results indicate that 1) improving exterior wall emissivity from 0.2 to 0.98 drops the temperature for both cabinet wall and internal ambient air by 25°F: 2) the difference between internal ambient-air and cabinet-wall temperatures at a given power level remains nearly constant despite variations in cabinet-wall temperature; and 3) concentrating sources near the cabinet top produces extreme gradients in the local ambient while the air below remains considerably cooler whereas dissipation only in the lower levels produces near isothermal ambient temperatures throughout."
"Silver reacts readily with many atmospheric contaminants. The tarnishing of silver is a result recognizable to most people. When a tarnish film is made up by exposure to sulphur, and the silver is then heated in the 300°-700°C temperature range, unexpected surface activity occurs. An analysis of this activity reveals that spherical globules collect over the entire surface area. The nature and extent of globule formation depends upon the amount of sulphur on the silver surface, the exposure time, temperatur, and the oxygen content of the atmosphere in which the silver is heated. A method for removing the causative contamination is suggested Which might improve the performance of silver alloy or silver-plated parts used in electronic components."
"Aluminum-thin-film interconnections crossing Si-SiO2steps were temperature cycled 1500 times from-55° to 150°C and the films in the vicinity of Si-SiO2steps have been examined using a scanning electron microscope. Grain boundary sliding, grooving, and the striations are observed. The observations indicate that the failure mechanisms due to fatigue in Al films are similar to the ones observed for bulk samples."
"Dielectric films of anodically formed HfO2based on Hf films of different degrees of orientation as well as reactively sputtered HfO2films were studied. The anodic oxide grown on oriented Hf films and the reactively sputtered HfO2films were monoclinic and showed partial orientation with the"
"Transmission line principles are applied to twisted magnet wire lines made of two wires to establish design limits. Expressions are developed to predict the effects of wire film insulation and of twisting. A design procedure is developed to realize a desired characteristic impedance for the design of radio frequency broad-band transformers, signal combiners, and pulse transformers."
"A number of tactical radio sets have been reported inoperable as a result of lead breakage of transistor and quartz crystals. The lead material was a KovarTM-type iron-nickel-cobalt glass sealing alloy (54 percent Fe-29 percent Ni-17 percent Co). The location and type of fractures indicated that these leads failed by stress-corrosion cracking. Such failures result from the combined effects of mechanical stress and a mildly corrosive atmosphere. The only source of specific corrodent for this type of failure was chloride ions found in residual flux on printed circuitry. The corrosive effects of the residual flux was demonstrated by the identification of corrosion products found on the printed wiring. Careful selection of the solder flux, scrupulous cleaning of the printed-circuit boards, and conformal coating is recommended for all similar applications."
"The design of thin-film distributed RC networks is discussed briefly and a chart is presented that greatly facilitates the initial design procedure. This chart is then used to demonstrate the limitations imposed upon minimum usable frequency by space availability, maximum sheet resistance, and maximum capacitance density."
"This paper is concerned with the computer costs for both the steady-state and transient thermal responses of large-scale integrated circuits (LSI) when metal is present within the substrate. For the more cost-sensitive transient case, an extrapolation technique for computer time savings is compared with the accuracy loss in this study. This approach could be useful for design-cost planning."
    "Conventional carbon brushes developed for earth's surface applications were found to be inadequate in terms of wearing life when applied in electrical contact with copper slip rings operating in dry inert-gas atmospheres. Under similar conditions, however, the life of such brushes was vastly increased when special treatments were incorporated in their body structure. One of these treatments (40 W/o MoS2) imparted life ability and electrical voltage stability comparable to those of present-day industrial grade brushes operating in normal air atmospheres."
"The effect of a vacuum environment on welding of Cu-Bi (0.3%) electrical contacts has been investigated. The experiments have been planned in order to differentiate between the effects of cold welding, diffusion welding and percussion welding. Cold welding has no affect on newly prepared electrodes, but after the electrodes have been arced appreciably a small residual cold weld force is experienced. The diffusion weld strength is strongly dependent upon the contact force, the electrode temperature and the time in contact. The strongest weld forces are measured in the percussion weld experiment where the electrodes experience a high current prestrike arc as they close. It is also found in this study that the weld force decreases rapidly after the electrode faces are exposed to the residual gases in the vacuum. These results are discussed in terms of the chemisorption of residual gases and the real area of electrical contact. The effects of the change in nature of the electrode surfaces are discussed and a satisfactory qualitative explanation of the results is reached."
"The publication offers a note of thanks and lists its reviewers."
 "Constriction resistance measurements based on non-linearity tend to ignore tunnel films because of the ohmic behavior and temperature insensitivity of tunnel resistance. Theory and experimental verification are given to show that tunnel films can be detected and measured by comparing conventional contact resistance measurements with constriction resistance values obtained with the non-linearity technique."
"An apparatus has been constructed which allows the manipulation of electrical contacts inside a scanning electron microscope. The contact members can be positioned so that an image of their edge profiles can be obtained at magnifications as high as 10,000X. The microgeometry of both the anode and cathode surfaces is clearly imaged. The contacts can be brought together to make electrical contact and then separated to a desired distance. The interelectrode spacing and both contact members can be viewed on the cathode ray tube of the scanning electron microscope. With this technique, contact gaps of less than one micron can be set and measured. Both contacts are connected to coaxial cable circuitry external to the microscope. A pulse of predetermined potential and duration can be transmitted to one of the contact members. If breakdown occurs, an oscillographic record of the event is obtained as well as an immediate image of the damage on the anode and cathode profiles. One of the contacts can then be rotated to obtain a front view for measurements of the arc damage. Using this technique the phenomenon of electrode bridging from an eruption of molten metal from the anode has been observed. Electric fields required for the initiation cf short arcs have been measured as have the diameters of anode craters and their rim heights"
 "The reliable performance of electrical contacts often depends on the dimensional stability of the spring material used to operate these contacts. The fatigue and stressrelaxation behavior of two copper-base alloys, Copper Development Association Alloys 510 (5 percent tin phosphor bronze) and 725 (89%Cu-9%Ni-2%Sn), strengthened by thermomechanical processing has been investigated. Strengthening mechanisms resulting from a combination of cold work and low temperature heat treatment have been taken advantage cf to produce electromechanical spring materials which have good conductivity and corrosion resistance, have sufficient ductility forpunching and forming, are dimensionally stable for long periods of time and also adequately resist fatigue stressing. Test data are presented which show the materials processed in this manner to have significant advantages over currently available, commercial tempers in that they permit designs having higher working stresses and better material utilization, thus filling a need created by miniaturization."
"Studies were made of the contact resistance of Ag2S films on pure silver, and on gold-silver and palladium-silver alloys. Although relatively thick films of Ag2S on silver gave low contact resistance, equivalent film thicknesses on other substrates gave contact resistance values that were orders of magnitude higher. These results were attributed to mechanical rather than electrical-property differences of either the films, the substrates, or an interaction of both. Data clearly indicate that the \"desirable\" properties of silver sulfide are unique only to films on pure silver."

"Preliminary results obtained from an investigation of the impedance and radiation properties of a novel broadband linearly polarized antenna called the rudimentary horn are reported. When properly designed the antenna is found to be capable of maintaining its desirable radiation and impedance characteristics over a 10:1 band of frequencies."
  "Under the effects of ionospheric scintillations, the fading of RH and LH circularly polarized 136 MHz signals is observed to be perfectly correlated. Polarization diversity reception will not improve the reliability of VHF space communications through the turbulent ionosphere."
"A two-dimensional electromagnetic boundary-value problem consisting in the synthesis of the primary fields of a transmitting feed antenna for a circular-cylindrical reflector is considered. A primary field that corrects for the phase aberration of the reflector is synthesized as a sum of circular waves whose common origin is displaced from the center of curvature of the reflector. Limitations on the gain of the feed-reflector combination as a function of the number of waves and the displacement are discussed. The synthesized fields are compared with those obtained from geometrical optics."
"To produce directional antenna patterns having a shaped beam in one plane such as is required, for instance, in the case of rotating-search radar antennas having a vertical radiation pattern of cosecant-squared shape, doubly curved reflectors are used as a rule. Besides the well-known composition of such reflectors from a stack of strips of parabolic shape, the paper delineates possibilities of an assembly from strips of elliptic shape that are also segments of parabolic dishes. With reflectors assembled in this way certain antenna characteristics such as directivity, sidelobe suppression, etc., can be modified and improved, depending on the type of strip configuration proposed. Experimental results gained with two different reflectors (width12.5\\lambda, height5.6\\lambda) assembled from strips of elliptic shape are discussed. One of the strip configurations devised turns out particularly favorable for small reflectors."
"The problem of realization of an arbitrary current distribution on an broadside array antenna derived from the theory of pattern synthesis is treated and some practical methods are proposed. In these methods, the input voltage of each antenna is transformed by a reactive transformer to take the required value. In one of the methods, experiments to yield Chebyshev patterns were performed and satisfactory results were obtained."
"Normal design practice for traveling wave arrays assumes that radiating elements cause negligible mismatch to the transmission line feed. This assumption cannot be made for tightly coupled or largely reactive radiating elements. An analysis is given for calculating element resistances and spacings which will produce an aperture distribution with the desired amplitude and linear phase in the presence of internal multiple reflections along the transmission line. The method leads in general to variable element spacing. Two examples of arrays designed on this basis are given."
"A variational formula for the input impedance of a thin asymmetrical cylindrical dipole is derived. The dipole parts may be of the same radius or of different radii. The expression for the impedance is derived using a two-term trial function for current. Impedances of a number of asymmetrical antennas with the two parts of the same radius and of different radii are evaluated. The results are in excellent agreement with those according to the King-Wu theory in cases where the latter are available."
"It is well known that a linear antenna array with equally spaced elements can be represented by a polynomial whose roots correspond to the nulls of its antenna pattern. Since the linear array has equally spaced elements, its polynomial has only integral powers of the variable, so that the array can be represented by aZtransform. Therefore, the effect of moving roots of the polynomial can be represented as a linear sampled-data system problem, which is solved by using a table ofZtransforms or by discrete numerical convolution. In this paper, the quantitative effects on the array and its antenna pattern caused by moving roots of the polynomial are determined, and these effects are utilized for array synthesis to produce desired antenna patterns. Examples illustrating the use of this new synthesis technique include modification of a uniform array to obtain low sidelobes in the antenna pattern and synthesis of an array to produce nulls in its antenna pattern in the directions of discrete and spatially distributed interference sources."
"Analytical and numerical results are presented for the array element pattern of axial slits in conducting cylinders. The slits are fed by parallel-plate guides in the TEM mode and are matched to free space. Both harmonic series and integral representation for the far-field patterns are obtained and numerically evaluated as a function ofkr_{0}and spacing. The integral representation is treated asymptotically for large values ofkr_{0}. The element patterns exhibit two characteristic features: a dip off broadside and a ripple in the main beam near broadside, the level of both beingkr_{0}dependent. While the harmonic series offers no basis for an explanation of these effects, the asymptotics clearly demonstrates that the pattern can be decomposed into two parts: 1) a space wave contribution which can be directly obtained by substituting the circular array \"admittance crater\" into the appropriate planar array formulas and exhibits a dip analogous to a grating lobe effect; 2) a set of creeping waves which, unlike the more common type, contribute significantly in the forward region and, by interfering with the space wave, cause the ripple near broadside. These creeping waves are the fast (usuallyn = -1) space harmonics (grating lobes) of the fundamental, slightly slow set, and their presence does not seem to have been recognized in the literature."
"Then-arm logarithmic spiral antenna havingndistinct terminals may be considered as an (n-1)-port antenna. It may be operated simultaneously in (n-1)independent balanced modes. By varying the relative excitation of these modes it is possible to produce a variety of patterns that have applications to direction finding, tracking, and homing over a broad range of frequencies. It is particularly easy to obtain useful results in this manner because of some unique properties of the logarithmic spiral. The basic relations between mode excitation and the related fields of these multiarm antennas are reviewed together with some properties that are characteristic of the log-spiral geometry. Multimode single-aperture systems, such as those using a relatively simple hybrid matrix to synthesize multiple beams tilted from the axis of the antenna, are discussed. These tilted beams can be conically scanned about the axis of the antenna by a simple phase shift within the excitation matrix."
"The problem of an electromagnetic wave obliquely incident upon a plasma slab is considered as a boundary-value problem, using a self-consistent solution of the coupled linearized Vlasov and Maxwell equations for the electrons, with the ions treated as a fixed, uniform background. Power reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients are derived under the assumption that electrons undergo specular reflection at the surfaces of the plasma slab. Although our analysis is valid for arbitrary slab thickness, computational results are presented for slabs which are thin compared to a free-space wavelength. The results show a series of resonances which are attributed to the kinetic behavior of the plasma. The results further show that the resonances are Landau damped as the thermal velocity of the plasma electrons increases. While similar resonances can be predicted from the coupled linearized hydrodynamic Maxwell equations, such a model does not predict Landau damping. The effects of a finite collision frequency are then included via a simple Bhatnager-Gross-Krook collision term. The numerical computations vividly indicate that the resonances undergo severe damping for extremely small ratios of the collision frequency to signal frequency."
"Continuous wave signals at 9.6 GHz were propagated over a 97-km overwater path extending from an elevation of 80 m to 3000 m mean sea level (MSL). Variations in phase of arrival of the signals received by antennas having1.2\\degand5\\degbeam widths were recorded simultaneously. With the nominal path elevation angle of1.2\\deg, the broad-beam antenna received a contribution reflected from the sea surface, while the narrow-beam antenna largely discriminated against such reflections. The spectra of phase variations for the two cases were compared, and their coherency was computed. The broad-beam signal displayed consistently higher spectral density than did the narrow-beam signal over the fluctuation frequency range from 0.1 Hz to the limit of the analysis at about 10 Hz. The relatively large effect of multipath phase noise on range rate measurements is discussed."
"The scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave, arbitrarily polarized and normally impinging on a wedge-tapered absorbing structure, is theoretically and experimentally studied. The theoretical solution is found in two asymptotic cases: spacing between consecutive edges, small and large with respect to the incident wavelength. In the former case, a transmission line analogy is set up; in the latter, quasi-optical techniques are applied. Numerical and experimental results are presented; the latter are in good agreement with the theory. The possibility of using the studied structure as an absorbing termination is discussed in some detail, and optimizing criteria, as well as the possibility of obtaining polarization-independent performance, are indicated."
"In the following, a bound on the electric field magnitude existing over a phased array antenna is presented. Use of this bound in predicting the power handling capability of the array is discussed. It is shown that, although the overall array is large with respect to wavelength, the narrow beamwidth often required significantly affects the near field over the aperture and just outside the antenna. The result is compared to a previously existing bound obtained for a single rectangular aperture."
"A theorem concerning the maximum realized gain of arbitrary arrays is proven. The theorem is applied to the specie case of uniformly spaced circular arrays. A gain equivalence between multiple planar and circular arrays is also derived."
"The general theory interrelating active reflection coefficient and element efficiency or realized gain for arbitrary antenna arrays is applied to circular cylindrical arrays. An upper bound corresponding to the exclusion of supergain is obtained."
"This communication presents a modal approach for investigating mutual coupling on a cylindrical array of waveguide elements. Computed results are given in the form of element patterns and are compared with measured patterns."
"Ideal reflector simulation of wire gratings is considered. Results for infinite plane gratings under linearly polarized plane waves, based on Astrakhan's averaged boundary conditions, yield conclusions on influence of wire orientation, mesh size, and wire connection. The grating sag is considered. Its influence on strength and phase shift of the reflection is estimated from a simple scatter problem, using Kirchhoff's approximation. A smoothness criterion is given. The results of the work are related to an unstationary method to measure radiation patterns of aircraft antennas in flight."
"An asymptotic expression is derived for the mutual admittance between axial rectangular slots on a large conducting cylinder. The isolation between slots determined from this mutual admittance approximation is compared with that obtained using the admittance from direct numerical integration and with experimental results for a cylinder in free space and in the presence of a simulated thin plasma sheath."
"In recent evaluations of large parabolic reflector antennas, engineers have investigated the antenna performance at several frequencies. In this paper it is shown that the efficiency at any frequency can be estimated from a measured efficiency at another frequency and a carefully calculated design efficiency. In practice, an efficiency measurement at some frequency usually serves to determine the efficiency at all lower frequencies."
"The transmission line approach is used to describe scattering from a circular cylinder coated with a nonuniform dielectric. Rather simple techniques can be used for obtaining the solution in terms of surface admittance of the inner cylinder. An equivalent circuit for the sheath is a by-product of this approach. Numerical results include graphs of the effect of corrugations on the inner cylinder."
"It is shown that when both the source and field point are sufficiently close to a diffracting edge to require a closer approximation to the field than is provided by the usual Fresnel integrals, the rigorous solution can be put in terms of the incomplete Hankel function, whose asymptotic properties are known and which is well tabulated. The solution remains valid without change of form in the vicinity of the shadow boundary, and it reduces, respectively, to the known Hankel or Fresnel formulation at the shadow boundary or when either the source or field point is distant from the edge."
"Isolated asymmetrical cylindrical dipoles and two such parallel nonstaggered identical dipoles are analyzed using a polynomial approximation for current. If the lengths of the two dipole parts do not exceed0.5\\lambda, numerical results indicate that the simplest second-order polynomial approximation suffices for most purposes. Only if very accurate current distribution is desired, the third-order polynomial distribution need be used."
"An expression is derived for the average backscattering cross section of an obstacle for arbitrary transmitter and receiver antenna polarizations. Results are given for straight wires, circular loops, and one-turn helices."
"Mathematical relationships are derived for evaluating the effects of a dispersive medium, such as the ionosphere, on an FM Gaussian shape pulse. The distortion of the amplitude, pulse length, and modulation caused by the ionosphere is examined in terms of the integrated electron density along the transmission path and the system parameters of the transmitted signal."
"For a finite-length cylindrical monopole antenna mounted vertically on a perfectly conducting ground plane and driven by a dc pulse, the time variation of the electric and magnetic field intensities at points located at distances of the order of the monopole length from the antenna has been computed. The ratio of the monopole length to its radius was assumed to be 904, the source impedance 300 ohms, and the pulse length was taken to be equal to four tenths the time required for pulse transmission to the end of the antenna."
"The exact method of designing an array of dipole antennas with the prescribed radiation patterns in the magnetic plane is described. The integral of the current distribution, which is expressed according to the improved circuit theory, is set equal to the magnitude of the point source, which is given by the conventional synthesis method. The current distributions and the correct set of driving voltages or currents are sought to the prescribed radiation pattern simultaneously by the present method."
"The results of both analytical and experimental research in the area of multimode slow wave planar spiral design are reported. This research is directed toward the development of a compact flush-mounted multimode antenna for future space applications. The technique followed in this investigation was to first modify existing analytical models of planar spiral antennas to take into account the effects of the slow wave geometry on the radiated pattern. These models are then used to optimize the design of certain multimode slow wave planar spiral antennas. Experimental antennas corresponding to these optimized designs were constructed and their field patterns are compared to those predicted by the analytical models. The comparison of the results indicates very favorable agreement between the analytical predictions and experimental data."
"A technique which allows the analytical specification of optimal array geometry that enhances array reception is developed. The technique is illustrated for small antenna arrays of up to four elements in two classes of interference fields, with and without spatial constraints. The analytical treatment is predicated upon signal detectability and employs error-free arrays of noninteracting nondirectional elements. The interference fields considered are those due to isotropic sources (case I) and sources uniformly distributed on an unbounded plane (case II). The optimality criterion is minimization of the signal detection error probability. For a phased receiving array, this is equivalent to maximizing the array detectability gain function, which has the effect of maximizing the predetection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The optimal array configuration is found to be two-dimensional in both cases (circular configuration in case I and elliptical configuration in case II, with the antennas equally spaced in angle along the periphery of the configuration). Numerical results are given which indicate that practical increases in predetection SNR of as much as 10 to 15 dB can be achieved by employing the array configuration most appropriate for the space-time correlation structure of the interference fields."
"An expression is derived for the admittance of an aperture radiating into a lossy warm overdense plasma half-space. The result is examined in the limiting cases of low and high electron temperatures."
"Based on the covariance principle of Maxwell's equations and phase-invariance principle (derived from the special theory of relativity), expressions for the nonlinear reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves from weakly ionized plasmas moving perpendicular to the interface have been obtained. It is seen that the effect of nonlinearity is quite appreciable even when the electromagnetic waves are moderately strong."
"The propagation of relatively high-power electromagnetic transient signals through a homogeneous, isotropic, and partially ionized plasma medium is discussed. In particular, the nonlinear dispersion of a transient RF signal caused by the dependence of the electron-neutral collision frequency on the electron temperature is studied. Valuable insights into the effects that plasma nonlinearities have on the distortion of a transient signal result from the numerical evaluation of the solution which is in integral form."
"The radar backscattering from thin conductive films is examined and an expression which provides an indication of the loss in cross section as a function of layer thickness is derived. Experimental results are given for aluminum and nickel, as obtained from anechoic chamber measurements. It is indicated that a metallic film of only a few thousandths of a skin depth is all that is necessary to provide reflection coefficients of unity, and that the only material property of any significance is the dc conductivity. As a result, it is concluded that a ferromagnetic material does not allow for utilization of a thinner film as a reflective surface."
"An effort recently undertaken to compute radar cross sections of thin metallic disks for frequencies near resonance is described. All calculations are based upon an ideal disk scattering problem in which each disk is assumed to be perfectly conducting and infinitely thin and the incident field is assumed to be an electromagnetic plane wave. A good agreement between the values of the backscattered fields for the ideal disk scattering problem and the thin metallic disk scattering problem for large values ofkais found, but may become poor forkaless than or equal to 1.0."
"Peak signal strength is one critical parameter in analyzing the vulnerability of electronic systems to the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a nuclear burst. Two probability distribution functions of EMP signal amplitudes are derived using the central limit theorem. These distribution functions express peak amplitude as a percentage of total incident signal energy."
"The iterative sampling method is introduced for the synthesis of shaped-beam radiation patterns using either line sources or uniformly spaced arrays. Given an original pattern which is some approximation to the desired pattern, a series of correction patterns is added to it. Successive iterations are applied in this manner until the desired performance is achieved. The current distribution is found by a corresponding series of corrections. Several examples show that patterns with either low main-beam ripple and/or low sidelobe level or sharp cutoff from the main beam can be obtained. Unless there is significant ripple or sidelobe improvement, the complexity of the required source current is usually lower than that of the original pattern. For a ten-element array example with\\pm 1-percent error in the current amplitudes and phases about -40 dB, sidelobe and ripple performance was achieved. Furthermore, the iterative sampling method is simple to apply and converges rapidly."
"Numerical solutions are obtained for the problem of radiation from an infinite array of rectangular waveguides, each of which is loaded with iris at the array aperture. It is shown that the introduction of aperture irises can remove a radiation null in the active element pattern and significantly improve the array performance over a wide frequency band."
"The backscatter cross sectionQfor high-frequency irradiated turbulent dielectric media, many mean free pathsL_{1}wide, is computed. The lengthL_{1}is the distance into the medium over which the mean electric field decreases in amplitude by a factore^{-1}. Previous calculations have always been restricted toL \\ll L_{1}. It is found thatQincreases from the Born approximationQ = Q_{1}for medium widthL \\ll L_{1}toQ = 2Q_{1}forL \\gg L_{1}, and the theory is valid as long asL \\ll (kL_{0})^{5/3} L_{1}, a significant improvement over the Born approximation, when the macroscaleL_{0}is much larger than the wavelength2_{\\pi}k^{-1}. The improvement is due to incorporation of the dominant effects of cumulative forward scattering in the local electric field in the medium. A rigorous and a heuristic derivation are given. The transitional behavior is discussed and a simple physical interpretation is given."
"A simplified solution to the problem of the radio wave diffraction over terrain irregularities is presented. The theoretical analysis assumes that each obstacle can be represented by a cylinder with a radius equal to the radius of curvature at the obstacle top. The solution is based on the method proposed by Deygout for the knife-edge case. The experimental results have shown a good agreement with the theoretical calculation."

"The theory of scattering by an imperfectly conducting, dielectric, or plasma sphere is reviewed briefly. Numerical values of the backscattering and forward scattering cross sections of spheres are given over wide ranges of radius, conductivity, and permittivity including both positive and negative values. The angle of the electric field in the forward and backward directions is also represented."
"A computed value of static capacitance for a 300-ft umbrella antenna with twelve 9-in diameter multiple wire-ribs is presented and compared with measured capacitances of both fractional- and full-scale models of this structure. In addition, the computed values of static capacitance of this umbrella antenna are presented for rib diameters of\\frac{1}{4}to 48 in which indicate capacitance increases of approximately 50 percent."
"The general problem involving the distribution of current and the driving-point impedance of a top-loaded antenna is formulated. Consideration is given to an idealized structure having one or more cylindrical top-loading elements. For the practically important case involving conductors of small radius, the axial currents are obtained as the solution to a pair of coupled integral equations. Approximate solutions obtained by numerical methods for the invertedL-,T-, and four-element top-loaded antennas are compared with measured driving-point impedances. Satisfactory agreement indicates the possibility of utilizing the theory in the analysis of practical configurations involving many top-loading elements."
"Results from two 48-hour beam-swinging experiments in transhorizon microwave propagation are presented. A 3.2-GHz signal was transmitted over a 164-km path and received with a 12-element vertical antenna array (beamwidth0.29\\degelevation by5\\degazimuth). The beam was rapidly scanned in elevation. Experimental angular response patterns (antenna scans) averaged over about 3 min are compared with theoretical patterns computed from turbulent scattering theory. There is considerable variability in the experimental patterns for different time periods. The experimental patterns for different time periods are separated into three groups. Signal group 1 patterns resemble the response of the array to a point source. A propagation model based on partial reflection or refraction from a stratified atmospheric layer best describes these signal characteristics. Signal group 2 patterns can be described by a model predicting a smooth decrease in scattered power with scattering angle at a rate inversely proportional to themth power of the angle withmbetween 4 and 10. A propagation model based on atmospheric turbulence can describe these signal characteristics only if it includes modifying factors to account for the difference in the exponentmobserved at different time periods. Signal group 3 patterns are characterized by broadened maxima, by two or more maxima, or by a maximum which is significantly displaced above the horizon. These signals can be explained only by a model which contains a nonuniform scattering mechanism. A variation in signal characteristics as a function of time of day was evident in both experiments."
"It is shown that a log-periodic dipole antenna can be optimized by varying the feed-line characteristic impedance while carrying out swept-frequency far-field and impedance measurements. The minimization of narrow-band anomalies in the measured quantities results in a well-defined optimum characteristic impedance."
"An investigation has been made of the vertical-plane dual-beam properties of a doubly curved shaped-beam reflector to provide design information relative to possible modifications for a large class of surveillance antennas (in particular, the cosecant-squared family) in order to improve their performance when working in the presence of serious ground clutter problems. Experimental results obtained with anX-band model reflector utilizing various dual-feedhorn geometries are presented. Measured secondary patterns demonstrating several important performance characteristics are shown for a linearly polarized situation. Measured primary patterns for the feeds which generate these results are included, Two-way radar coverage diagrams for one set of dual-beam patterns are examined in detail. These plots make it clear that for many ground clutter minimizing applications it appears desirable to mix at RF the signals received by both feedhorns."
"A theoretical and experimental study of the use of thin perfectly conducting fences to reduce the mutual coupling of two parallel-plane waveguides radiating through a ground plane is described. The two cases which are studied areE-plane coupling of parallel planes with transverse electromagnetic mode propagation andH-plane coupling of parallel planes with the fundamental transverse electric mode propagation. The analysis presented accounts for a number of higher order modes in the waveguide apertures and uses a Fourier series approximation to the fence currents. Close agreement with experimental results is demonstrated."
"The coherent (mean) wave in an unbounded medium, characterized by random fluctuations superimposed on a deterministic background, is studied. Both the random fluctuations and the deterministic background are assumed to be uniaxial anisotropic. The procedure for obtaining the mean field is presented and generally follows the usual development of Dyson's equation (the diagrammatical representation of the integrodifferential equation for the mean field) except for modifications needed to treat the anisotropy. The use of these modifications allows the Feynman diagrammatical representation of Dyson's equation to remain unaltered except for the mass operator containing additional terms. An example is used to illustrate the procedure required to obtain an effective dielectric constant and the plane-wave dispersion relationship."
"The received field as focused by the parabolic main reflector of a Cassegrainian antenna at the surface of an arbitrary profile subreflector is calculated by a spherical wave expansion. This facilitates the application of the field correlation principle and leads to an expression for aperture efficiency taking into account diffraction effects. A comparison is made with numerical results previously published or obtained by other methods. The potential advantage of the technique is the speed of computation and the capability for synthesis as well as analysis of reflector shapes."
"A simplified analysis which gives insight into and physical interpretation on the radiation mechanism of an array of line sources above a finite ground plane is presented. Computations have been restricted to an array of two line sources since data are available for comparison. Results on the variation of the maximum field intensity, the angle of maximum field intensity, and the field intensity at the axis of the counterpoise as functions of the size of the ground plane are presented. Variations of the maximum field intensity and the angle of maximum field intensity as functions of the distance of the source above the ground plane are also illustrated. These data become very important in the design of antennas for aircraft navigation taking into account the presence of the finite counterpoise which otherwise could lead to erroneous designs."
"A method for the analysis of scattering from periodic structures based on the numerical solution of the integral equations is further developed. Using periodicity (Floquet's theorem), the range of the integral equations is reduced to a single period where the kernels are the Green's functions for periodic arrays. The numerical solution of the integral equations is obtained using the method of moments. Efficient numerical methods for the computation of the periodic Green's functions which allows their rapid evaluation with good accuracy are reported. A new treatment of the singularities which includes the effect of the surface curvature is given. Numerical results for the transverse electric scattering from a conducting surface with a sinusoidal height profile are presented, and several interesting physical phenomena are explored including Brewster angle effects and diffraction grating anomalies."
"Spherical-wave expansions are a well-known technique of expressing electromagnetic field data. However, most previous work has been restricted to idealized cases in which the expansion coefficients are obtained analytically. In this paper spherical-wave expansions are used as a numerical technique for expressing arbitrary fields specified by analytical, experimental, or numerical data. Numerical results on the maximum wave order needed to expand fields arising from a source of a given size are given for two practical cases, and it is found that the generally accepted wave order cutoff value corresponds to 99.9 percent or more of the power in the input pattern. Near-field patterns computed from far-field data are compared to measured data for the two cases, demonstrating the excellent numerical accuracy of the technique."
"In lossless inhomogeneous media the ray-optical description of the propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves exhibits the local and sequential properties of these phenomena. The extension of ray optics to lossy inhomogeneous media does not exhibit such properties, in general, since the equations defining the paths of rays connecting real source and observation points yield complex values of the space coordinates, i.e., complex rays. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the local and sequential propagation characteristics of fields in an inhomogeneous lossy medium, and to assertain the significance of the complex rays. The simplest configuration suited to this purpose is a planar interface between homogeneous lossless and lossy half-spaces. By studying the shadowing effects produced at an observation point by sampling windows placed in planes crossed by the field, one finds the region through which the field principally propagates to the observation point, and there-from the local and sequential properties. The results give physical meaning to complex rays and should provide a basis for a description of propagation and scattering in lossy media that avoids the use of complex space."
"A microwave resonant cavity method of plasma diagnostics is demonstrated for a parallel-plate cavity containing a cold, collisionless, and isotropic plasma. The method is extended to more general cavities and plasmas in the Appendix. The approach presented here differs from perturbational formulations in that assumptions about the perturbed fields are not made. The analysis gives an exact relation between the electron-density distribution and the resonant frequencies. Laboratory measurements of resonant frequencies then allow a spatially detailed computation of the electron-density distribution. Results are found to agree well with Langmuir probe measurements."
"A device using an RF discharge quasi-homogeneous plasma to measure antenna impedance is described. The plasma diagnosis is done by using a new probe made of a transparent resonant cavity. The electron densities (2 \\times 10^{8}to6 \\times 10^{9}particles/cm3) and collision frequencies (6 \\times 10^{7}to1.5 \\times 10^{8}per second) are controlled by the discharge power. The density distribution measurements indicate a quasi-homogeneous region of 20 by 20 by 14 cm. Impedance measurement results are given for a a thick unipole between 100 and 750 MHz. The values ofX = (\\omega_{p}/\\omega)^{2}range from 0 to 44. They agree fairly well with Deschamps model theory applied to scaled frequency measurements as well as to a quasistatic simple analytical formula. Sheath effects enhanced by a dc bias are observed especially at low frequencies and the sheath thickness increase is calculated and found consistent with Pavkovich's parabolic potential assumption. The possibility of electronic tuning by a suitable bias is suggested."
"The polarization behavior of electromagnetic waves propagating through a magnetoionic medium is investigated for the case of a moving source when the path of propagation crosses the point at which the magnetic field is transverse. The polarization is described in terms of the tilt angle and the axial ratio, which characterize the polarization ellipse. The polarization equation is derived and with certain plausible assumptions it is transformed into a form suitable for numerical computations. Using this equation the wave propagation from a satellite in a quasi-transverse region is simulated on a computer for different electron content values. The records thus obtained are compared with actual records of signals from the BEB satellite, received at São José dos Campos. The simulation reproduces almost every detail of the real received signal. The results and their possible application to communication problems and ionospheric investigation are briefly discussed."
"Analysis indicates that the canting angles of freely falling raindrops are of great importance in determining the magnitude of the cross polarization in higher frequency (18-30 GHz) radio relay systems. Since knowledge of these canting angles is sparse, the images of 463 raindrops obtained with a raindrop camera by personnel at the Illinois State Water Survey have been measured to obtain the distribution of canting angles during two rainstorms. The distributions for both storms are similar, with 40 percent of the drops having positive canting angles exceeding15\\degwith respect to the horizontal, and 25 percent having negative angles of less than-15\\deg. Calculations based on the measured distributions and representing upper bounds indicate that a relay system at both 18 and 30 GHz and with a repeater spacing of 3.5 km will experience cross polarization less than -20 dB at rain rates of 150 mm/hr."
 "The propagating mode on a periodic array of wires or strips is studied. Numerical solutions of the current distribution on each element, the propagation constant, and the cutoff frequencies of the propagating mode are found. It is discovered that this periodic structure in some cases can support propagating waves in two or more widely separated frequency bands."
"Using a theoretical-numerical technique involving the magnetic field integral equation, the radiation fields are determined for configurations comprised of a centrally located dipole and a thin quarter-wave monopole near conducting cylinders of finite lengths. Such configurations are important since they give measures of the radiation effects of fuselages of aircraft or other structures which the cylinders may model. The radiation fields are determined in the three principal planes for wavelengths passing through the resonant length of the cylinder, i.e.,L \\approx \\lambda. The radiation patterns for both the dipole and monopole sources when normalized with respect to one another are similar to within approximately 1 dB. The vertically polarized patterns in the horizontal plane (the plane orthogonal to the dipole axis and containing the cylinder axis) show small deviations from their near omnidirectional characteristics for cylinder electrical lengths of 0.5, 1.0, and1.5\\lambda. On the other hand, the cross polarized component (the horizontal component) in the same plane shows a substantial enhancement of the intensity of the lobe structure at resonance. The patterns are compared to those acquired experimentally in an anechoic chamber and close agreement is demonstrated."
"Expressions for directivity as a function of spacing, scan angle, and current distribution are presented for uniformly spaced linear arrays subject to the assumption that the element radiation intensity function of each radiator can be expressed in either of the following forms:(1 - \\sin^{2} \\theta \\cos^{2} \\Phi)^{P}or\\sin^{2P} \\theta \\sin^{2Q} \\PhiwherePandQare zero or positive integers. By proper choice ofPandQ, these expressions can be used to approximate the element radiation intensity function associated with a linear array of isotropic radiators, parallel short dipoles, collinear short dipoles, and planar equiangular spiral antennas. Analytical results are given for a number of cases, and graphical results are presented for directivity in the direction of scan angle for a linear array of radiators with a uniform current distribution and an element radiation intensity given by the expression\\sin^{2} \\theta \\sin^{2} Phiin the regiony \\geq 0and zero in the regiony < 0."
"Numerical iterative methods such as the steepest descent are shown to be a very powerful tool for pattern synthesis since they take full advantage of all available parameters such as element spacings, current's amplitudes and phases, pattern phase when not specified, and even frequency. Furthermore, the method allows the introduction of linear and nonlinear constraints in all parameters with no special difficulty."
"Determination of the true height of specific ionospheric plasma frequencies has been used for finding actual motions within the ionospheric plasma. The reported vertical soundings reveal a periodic variation in time at all bottomside altitudes. Spatial variations of this periodic structure have been observed at points separated by about 50 km. Daytime and nighttime periodic structures are different. Periodic variations of angle-of-arrival data of an oblique propagation experiment on a 1330-km circuit also have been analyzed. These periodicities are related to the same spatial periodic electron density structure in the bottomside ionosphere. The oblique reflections had dominant azimuth periods in the order of\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{2}, and1 h."
"The analysis of self- and mutual admittances for axial rectangular slots in an echelon configuration for a cylinder clad with a radially inhomogeneous plasma is presented. The isolation betweenE-plane coupled slots for cylinders of different radii clad with a typical low-altitude reentry plasma is compared with ground-plane based calculations for the same plasma conditions."
"The characteristics of the phase-difference fluctuations expected for an interferometer in a multipath field are derived from elementary considerations. The specific case considered is a two-path field in which the signal strength of the multipath components may be different at each of the interferometer elements. The phase fluctuations so derived bear a striking resemblance to some measured phase fluctuations of ionospherically propagated radio waves."
"The behavior that all physically realizable aperture distributions (tangential electric field in an aperture consisting of holes in a perfectly conducting planar sheet) must have at their edges is shown to be as follows. The components perpendicular and parallel to the aperture edge must each vanish with distancedfrom the edge asd^{\\alpha}, with\\alpha = 1for the perpendicular component and\\alpha = 2for the parallel component. An interesting consequence of this realizability condition is that the pedestal form of edge behavior usually assumed in aperture theory is physically impossible."
"The refractive index of drifting plasma is derived from the solution of a modified wave equation. The new refractive index is reduced in terms of stationary plasma parameters and its usefulness is outlined."
"In [8], both low- and high-frequency solutions to the two-sphere problem were presented in a form suitable for efficient computer solution, Here, numerical results are presented using a method which has enabled the first appearance of reliable results for the scattered field from two spheres of radii larger than one wavelength and as large as ten or more. Radar cross sections (RCS) are computed for numerous configurations of two spheres of various materials. Results for scattering by three collinear spheres are also given. An experimental program was undertaken and is briefly described. Whenever possible, these results are compared with the theory. In all cases the agreement is excellent. Depolarization due to multiple scattering is also investigated, revealing some interesting effects and practical applications to scattering range calibration."
"A method is presented of analyzing surface-wave excitation to an infinite periodic linear array in which only one element is excited and all others are parasitic. The approach taken in the analysis is based on the properties of the periodic structure. A formal solution for the current distribution on the array element is obtained, and the propagation constant of the surface wave is also found. In the case where the array consists of loop antennas, the surface wave can propagate only when the separation of the array element is less than one-half wavelength and the circumference of the loop is less than one wavelength. Calculated values of the propagation constant of an array are in good agreement with the measured results."

"A medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves whose dielectric constant or loss tangent has a prescribed profile was fabricated by using a large quantity of agar-agar in simulation chambers. The dielectric constant of the agar-agar could be changed continuously by means of a controlled diffusion of ethyl alcohol. The loss tangent of the same medium could be changed continuously by means of a controlled diffusion of NaCl. This paper is concerned with the design and characteristics of the simulation chamber. Topics to be considered include the properties of agar-agar in a wide frequency spectrum, the diffusion profiles, a reexamination of the principle of simulation, and the construction of various types of probes and simulation chambers."
"When a base-driven cylindrical monopole (or center-driven dipole) is immersed in an arbitrary medium, the electric and magnetic fields on its surface depend not only on its length and radius but also on the effective conductivity and permittivity of the medium. These fields can be explored and measured with small probes designed to travel along the cylindrical surface of the antenna. The interpretation of the observations depends on the availability of a general theory that correctly describes the distributions of current and charge on the conductor. The results of a new theory that is valid for electrically thin monopoles up to5\\lambda/8(dipoles up to5\\lambda/4)in length over all practical ranges of conductivity and permittivity of the ambient medium, including those characteristics of under- and overdense cold plasmas, are described together with their experimental verification."
"Expressions are obtained for the electromagnetic fields transmitted into the time-varying medium when a plane wave is incident upon either a dielectric or dispersive half-space. Solutions are obtained for the case when the medium is changed in a stepwise fashion, and also for the case when the medium varies slowly and continuously."
"The electromagnetic radiation from a slot antenna in a conducting plane coated with a moving isotropic cold plasma layer is considered. It is assumed that the direction of motion of the layer is across the slot, which is taken to be infinitely long. An integral representation for the field radiated through the plasma layer is obtained and evaluated asymptotically in the far zone by the method of steepest descents. The migration of the poles in the integrand of this integral representation as the speed of the slab is varied is discussed and related to several calculated radiation patterns. It is found that the motion of the plasma layer has the greatest effect on the radiation pattern when the wave frequency and plasma frequency are nearly equal."
"This paper studies the polarization of the main beam radiated from an infinite array of rectangular waveguides, and in particular, illustrates the matching procedure for the design of a circularly polarized array. It is demonstrated that the use of resonant irises at the waveguide openings together with a conventional matching junction inside the waveguides can improve both the power and the axial ratio of the main beam in a circularly polarized array. In general, a good matching design is the one which gives a proper compromise between the power and the polarization, and is not necessarily the one minimizing the reflection."
"The measurements of high-frequency (HF) radar cross sections (RCSs)\\sigmaof trees on a large flat field were reported a few years ago by Steele. This work used a special adaptation of the standing-wave method to 26 MHz. Shortly afterward, the present author used the same apparatus to measure the (RCSs) of cement walls erected on the same terrain. Wall sizes ranged from 5 ft high by 10 ft wide to 20 by 20 ft. Angles of elevation\\psiranged from 2.5 to22.5\\deg. Using vertical polarization (Efield in the plane of incidence), cross sections increased with wall size. When a wall was thoroughly dampened,\\sigmaincreased by 3 to 13 dB, depending on\\psi, and wall size over\\sigmawas obtained when the wall was dry or partly damp. Chicken wire covering increased the 10- by 10-ft wall's cross section by 10 dB. Using horizontal polarization, cross sections were immeasurable for the smaller walls. For the 20- by 20-ft wall,\\sigmawas a smoothly increasing function with\\psi. When this wall was wet, its cross section increased by 4 dB. The wall-ground combination was treated as a corner reflector, using a theory based on physical optics. The theory compares fairly well to experimental cross sections for the 20- by 20-ft wall. Extrapolation of the theory suggests that a 150-ft high by 100-ft wide building could have a cross section approaching10^{4}m2at 26 MHz."
"At a given frequency every perfectly conducting obstacle has associated with it a particular set of surface currents and corresponding radiated fields which are characteristic of the obstacle shape and independent of any specific excitation. These characteristic modes form a useful basis set in which to expand fields radiated or scattered at a great distance from the obstacle. Once these modes are known for a given obstacle, the scattering of plane waves incident from arbitrary source directions into arbitrary receiver directions may be evaluated concisely. To support the theory, a method is described for determining characteristic mode currents on thin wires of general shape and is applied to several shapes to generate certain backscattering and input admittance data. Wherever possible comparison is made with existing data."
"Using the concept of modified power density, expressions are derived for the radiation resistance and efficiency of antennas in a dissipative medium."
"Matrix methods described earlier for array design for a specified pattern are limited in that the number of values that can be specified in the far-zone field must equal the number of independent applied excitation voltages. In this communication an extension is described to handle cases where the number of specified values exceeds the number of independent applied excitations."
"A set of arbitrarily located receiving antenna elements, each connected with an appropriate network, can be used to construct a matched filter where the antenna array response results in an autocorrelation of a specified desired signal, correlating over time and space coordinates simultaneously. A receiving system using such a signal processing antenna can discard interferences which do not have the same spectral characteristics as the desired signal, or which do not originate from the same point as the desired signal source. Examples of correlating antenna arrays for various arbitrary intelligence modulations of the desired signal are discussed in this communication."
"Numerical and analytical calculations show the phase of backscatter fields from thin perfectly conducting rods at constant distance from the scatterer to become essentially independent of aspect angle for rod lengths less than\\lambda/2, to approach a limit near180\\degfor shorter rods, and in broadside directions to depend only on rod thickness when rod lengths are an integral multiple of\\lambda."
"The optimum transmission of electromagnetic waves through a thin exponentially inhomogeneous plasma region is treated in this communication. Matched filter theory is used in obtaining integral expressions for optimum transmitted signals, which result in received signals that have the largest possible amplitude when transmitted through the plasma region. The fast Fourier transform algorithm is used in obtaining signal waveforms for a number of examples."
"AnN-arm log-spiral antenna may be excited inN - 1orthogonal modes ofN-tuple input. A rigorous solution to the spiral antenna of more than two arms is obtained by numerical solution of the integral equations. Results for a four-arm spiral, including current distribution, half-power beamwidth, beam orientation, and gain and phase centers, are presented. The propagation constant of the current waves along each spiral arm is found to be approximately the speed of light. An approximatek-\\betadiagram is given which may be used to estimate the size of the antenna for each mode of operation."
"The problem of designing a transverse feed for a spherical reflector is considered and a method is presented for synthesizing the fields on a surface of a sphere enclosing a feed that will produce a specified reflected field at the surface of a spherical reflector. The method identifies the reflector and a spherical surface enclosing the feed as a boundary value problem and uses a finite set of spherical waves to approximate the boundary conditions. A feed designed to excite this field will in turn produce the desired reflected field at the surface of the reflector, under the condition that that portion of the reflected field which is scattered by the feed may be neglected. It is shown that the feed need produce only a small part of the synthesized field to obtain an antenna efficiency of more than 70 percent. Some typical field distributions will be shown so as to indicate a method for designing a feed and to point out the correlation between the polarization of the synthesized field and the polarization of the reflected field at the surface of the reflector."
"This paper investigates the problem of diffraction of an electromagnetic wave by a semi-infinite conductor by means of the computer method based on an integral equation formulation. The cross section of the conductor can have an arbitrary shape, provided the face shined by the incident wave is a uniform plane in the region far from the edge. In that plane region, the problem is simply that of reflection from a conductor wall for which a solution is known. This known part of the solution is analytically excluded to derive an integral equation describing the edge effect over a limited region. The limited region is unknown at first and must be determined from the results of some numerical computations. As a numerical example, a thick half-plane conductor is treated in which the electric field polarization is parallel to the conductor, i.e., the case of an incidentEwave."
"Solution to the multiple scattering of electromagnetic (EM) waves by two arbitrary spheres has been pursued first by the multipole expansion method. Previous attempts at numerical solution have been thwarted by the complexity of the translational addition theorem. A new recursion relation is derived which reduces the computation effort by several orders of magnitude so that a quantitative analysis for spheres as large as10\\lambdain radius at a spacing as small as two spheres in contact becomes feasible. Simplification and approximation for various cases are also given. With the availability of exact solution, the usefulness of various approximate solutions can be determined quantitatively. For high frequencies, the ray-optical solution is given for two conducting spheres. In addition to the geometric and creeping wave rays pertaining to each sphere alone, there are rays that undergo multiple reflections, multiple creeps, and combinations of both, called the hybrid rays. Numerical results show that the ray-optical solution can be accurate for spheres as small as\\lambda/4in radius is some cases. Despite some shortcomings, this approach provides much physical insight into the multiple scattering phenomena."
"For many applications the ideal antenna pattern is one in which radiated power is spread uniformly over the cone\\theta < \\theta_{0}, with no power going outside that cone. For example, either the target orientation or the antenna axis may only be known with tolerance\\theta_{0}. While this ideal pattern is unachievable by a finite antenna aperture, it may be asymptotically approached as aperture size goes to infinity. We here formulate a new worst-case criterion for comparing the effectiveness of finite aperture illuminations with respect to synthesizing this ideal radiation pattern. For illustration some classical illuminations are scrutinized from the viewpoint of this new criterion."
"This paper deals with the long distance propagation of FM pulses in dispersive media. The treatment is based on an asymptotic theory which utilizes space-time rays and plane wave dispersion surfaces as well as integral representations. The discussion includes the propagation of prescribed FM signals in homogeneous media as well as synthesis of signals to achieve maximum pulse compression. Special attention is given to the caustics and foci exhibited by the space-time ray system when pulse compression takes place, and to the description of the field in the corresponding space-time transition regions where simple asymptotic constructs are inadequate. While the theory is presented for media with relatively arbitrary spatial and dispersive characteristics, detailed calculations are carried out for a homogeneous isotropic cold plasma for which results can be obtained in explicit form."
"A numerical method of analysis is developed to determine the characteristics of a homogeneous dielectric antenna of arbitrary shape based on a general expression of electromagnetic wave scattering by a homogeneous dielectric body derived by Barrar and Dolph. This method is tested on a dielectric-disk antenna."
"A simple technique is presented for converting a known solution for the electric and magnetic vector fields in a dielectric medium at rest into the corresponding fields in a moving dielectric medium. The technique combines methods presented by Tai [1] with a scaling procedure developed by Clemmow [2]. Tai's work reduces the moving medium problem to the solution of Maxwell's equations in a uniaxial medium, and Clemmow's procedure enables one to convert a known solution in an isotropic medium to the corresponding solution in a uniaxial medium. Thus by first solving for the fields in the medium at rest, then following Clemmow's procedure to obtain the fields in Tai's uniaxial medium, and finally applying Tai's reasoning, one may easily obtain the solution of Maxwell's equations in the moving medium."
"This communication compares a more general numerical point-to-point transient wave propagation program to a known analytical (full-wave) solution based upon a certain special geometry and ionospheric profile. The main purpose of the comparison is that of using the known analytical results as a test case for the numerical program. The parameters of the ionosphere were chosen to purposively tax the condition of requiring a slowly varying medium in using the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) method (i.e., the parameters chosen lead to a sporadicE-type layer). With the results favorable for this case, the application of a numerical procedure, based upon the WEB method, to the more slowly varyingFregion would definitely be acceptable. Based upon the full-wave and WKB solutions, results are given in the form of time-domain waveforms due to reflection of a transient wave from the ionosphere."
"Driving point admittances of resistive cylindrical dipoles are computed by a variational method, using the two-term trial function for current proposed by King and Wu. The theoretical admittances are in excellent agreement with experimental results."
"Image theory in bianisotropic media in the presence of a perfectly conducting plane is derived. The conventional image theory is shown to apply for crystals with two principal axes parallel to the conducting plane, for gyrotropic media with magnetostatic fields perpendicular to the plane, and for all such media uniformly moving parallel to the plane."

"A circular-loop antenna composed ofNelements with arbitrary circumference arranged parallel in a row is analyzed by Fourier series expansion with emphasis on the existence of finite gaps at the driving points. The integral equations at the beginning are reduced to a series of linear simultaneous equations which contain only the Fourier coefficients of the electric currents of the same order. By appraising the current coefficients, the self-admittance is obtained as a sum of two parts: the finite series truncated at the number determined by the ratio of the circular-loop radius to the wire radius and the gap capacitance, and the mutual admittance is obtained as a finite series of fewer terms. Several computed curves concerning a parasitic endfire array of two elements are given, in which the computed values of the input admittance are substantiated by experiments, and radiation characteristics are examined to obtain a desirable configuration."
"The solution to the optimization of performance indices of array antennas such as directive gain, efficiency index, and signal-to-noise ratio, do not provide information regarding the sidelobe region of the radiation pattern. It is shown that, with proper constraints on the sidelobes, a given performance index can be optimized to give a radiation pattern with desired sidelobe levels. As most of the performance indices of an array antenna can be expressed as a ratio of two Hermitian quadratic forms, an eigenvalue method is used for the constrained optimization. This method gives explicit expressions for the excitation vector and constrained values of the performance indices. An iterative technique is used to ensure that the specified field values occur at the sidelobe peak positions. The element excitations obtained by this technique for maximum gain and uniform sidelobe level are similar to these obtained by the Dolph-Chebyshev technique."
"Variation of the apparent angular location of a radar target, or glint, is a form of backscattered wave-interference phenomenon. The resulting error can be of such magnitude as to indicate the reflecting object to be many times the target span beyond the actual target extent. A survey of the literature dealing with glint is presented. This review reveals no analytical model which is adequate in describing glint for a complex target, and yet simple enough to permit reasonable implementation for evaluating diversity improvements. A model is developed which uses the concept of computing the total backscattered field by coherent summation of the field contributions from nonisotropic scattering complexes. The glint error is determined by use of a simple geometric construction, together with values of total field phase in the region of the tracking aperture. A technique of synthesizing nonisotropic amplitude and phase patterns for scattering complexes is described. The results, having used a synthesized target and applying frequency and space diversity in a computer analysis, are presented. These indicate considerable tracking improvement by using the simple scheme of choosing the tracking-error signal which corresponds to the diversity return having the largest signal amplitude."
"A study is made of the radiation resistanceRof a small filamentary loop antenna immersed in a cold collisionless uniform multicomponent magnetoplasma. Assuming that the current distribution along the loop is uniform and that the loop axis is parallel to the static magnetic field, an integral expression is derived forRwhich is valid for arbitrary values of driving frequency, plasma composition and density, and static magnetic field strength. The mathematical properties of this integral are such thatRis finite for all values of the driving frequency, including the upper and lower hybrid frequencies as well as the multiple-ion hybrid-resonance frequencies. Application of the integral expression is made to the case of the inner magnetospheric plasma and approximate closed-form expressions are developed forRfor the very low-frequency/extremely low-frequency (VLF/ELF) range in the magnetosphere. Numerical results in the VLF/ELF range are also presented. It is found that the inclusion of multiple ions introduces interesting effects: sharp maxima appear at the gyrofrequency and the multipleion hybrid-resonance frequency associated with each ion, while sharp minima occur at the \"crossover\" frequencies. It is concluded that the presence of these relative extrema in the radiation resistance presents interesting possibilities for the use of a small loop as a diagnostic tool in a multicomponent plasma."
"An exact solution is derived for the line source that maximizes a generalizationD_{\\alpha}of the directivity in any given direction\\theta_{y}{0}for arbitrarily prescribed values of the aperture lengthl, the edge behavior exponent\\alpha, and the constraining superdirectivity ratio\\gamma_{\\alpha}. The quantityD_{\\alpha}represents exactly directivity for\\alpha = 1and approximately for any other value of\\alpha > -1. The solution is expressed in its natural form as a series of spheroidal functions\\psi_{\\alpha n}(c,\\eta)of order\\alpha. The most directive pattern space factor possible for an (N + 1)- term series expansion is shown to beF(c \\cos \\theta_{y}) = \\sum\\min{n=0}\\max{N} a_{\\alpha n}\\psi_{\\alpha n}(c, \\cos \\theta_{y})and the resulting aperture distribution to beA \\lgroup \\frac{2y}{l} \\rgroup = \\lgroup 1-[\\frac{2y}{l}]^{2} \\rgroup^{\\alpha} \\sum\\min{n=0}\\max{N} \\frac{a_{\\alpha n}}{\\nu_{\\alpha n}(c)} \\psi_{\\alpha n} \\lgroup c, \\frac{2y}{l} \\rgroup, wherea_{\\alpha 0}is an arbitrary (real) normalizing constant and the othera_{\\alpha n}must satisfy the following set ofNlinear equations:\\sum\\min{n=1}\\max{N} x_{pn}(\\mu,D_{\\alpha})a_{\\alpha n} = -x_{p0}a_{\\alpha 0} , p = 1,2,3,...,Nin whichX_{pn}(\\mu,D_{\\alpha}) = 2\\psi_{\\alpha n}(c, \\cos \\theta_{y0}) \\psi_{\\alpha p}(c, \\cos \\theta_{y0})(1 - \\cos^{2} \\theta_{y0})^{\\alpha} +(\\mu[\\gamma_{\\alpha n}(c) - \\gamma_{\\alpha}] - D_{\\alpha})\\Lambda_{\\alpha n}(c) \\delta_{pn}, and where the unknown directivityD_{\\alpha}and Lagrange multiplier\\mu, must be such thatD_{\\alpha}is the largest root of the determinantal equation| \\{X_{pn}(\\mu,D_{\\alpha})\\} | = 0that satisfies the constraining condition\\sum\\min{n=0}\\max{N} a_{\\alpha n}^{2}[\\gamma_{\\alpha n}(c) - \\gamma_{\\alpha}]\\Lambda_{\\alpha n}(c) = 0;cis\\pi l/\\lambda,\\nu_{\\alpha n}(c), and\\gamma_{\\alpha n}(c)are characteristic numbers of the spheroidal functions, and\\Lambda_{\\alpha n}(c)is the normalization factor for the spheroidal functions on the interval (-1,1).

"An asymptotic expansion has been obtained for the focal plane distribution (or the radiation pattern) of aperture antennas with Gaussian distributed random phase deviations. This asymptotic series not only offers convenience in numerical computation for large phase errors, but also clarifies the region of validity for the geometrical optics approximation."
"It is shown, that in the case of the electrically small tubular cylindrical antenna whose length-to-radius ratio is 0(1) or smaller, that the integral equation involved readily reduces to a simple, singular equation, the solution of which is in terms of elementary functions."
"The diffraction of a plane electromagnetic wave by a slit in a conducting screen of finite thickness is investigated using the Wiener-Hopf and generalized matrix techniques. For purposes of the analysis, the diffraction by two identical semi-infinite parallel-plate waveguides forming a tandem slit configuration is treated first in order to determine the interaction between the open ends of the waveguides. This interaction term is then utilized in solving for the thick slit geometry which is obtained by filling the parallel-plate regions with a dielectric whose relative permittivity is allowed to approach infinity. Although the integral equations occurring in the tandem slit configuration are similar to those given by Jones for the parallel-strip case, they are solved here by a somewhat different method. In contrast to the limitation on the strip-strip separation imposed by Jones, our solution is not restricted to the special case of large separation between the two slits. For anE-polarized incident plane wave, the far field diffracted by each edge of the thick slit is viewed in ray-optical terms as that due to a thin edge centered at the middle of the thick edge modified by a multiplication factor. The thick edge-edge interaction term, on the other hand, is also modified such that each thick edge is viewed by the other as a combination of a line source as well as a line dipole which vanishes when the thickness approaches zero. It is shown that for ratios of screen thickness to slit width below\\approx0.5, the beamwidth is larger than that of the thin slit, while for larger ratios the beamwidth is smaller. Typical diffraction patterns, which are in good agreement with experiment, are presented to illustrate this phenomenon."
"Some of the characteristics of a dipole plus a parallel parasitic element have been studied. The variation of resonant length as a function of parasitic spacing has been investigated using matrix inversion methods [1], [2] in conjunction with an iterative technique. Data on resonant resistance, beam patterns, and two-port open-circuit parameters are also given."
"A study is made of VLF fields excited by a horizontal dipole in the waveguide formed between the ice-covered ground and the anisotropic ionosphere of Antarctica. Numerical results are presented which describe the excitation, propagation, and polarization of radiated energy for ionospheres typical during both summer (daylight) and winter (night) conditions in Antarctica. The polarization of fields observed at the ice surface is found to be a function of both azimuth and range. Ice layer characteristics have significant effects on received fields, especially those of the quasi-TM type. The possible excitation of a TM-type surface wave at the ice-air interface under special conditions is also discussed. Fields propagating with wave numbers corresponding to quasi-TE modal solutions are least attenuated in the waveguide. Summer ionospheres tend to increase modal attenuation rates. Results are applied to a real experimental situation in Antarctica involving a horizontal dipole source and trans-Antarctic propagation paths."
"The feed requirements for an active radiating array in which each element is independently excited by a transistor are shown to be less dependent on the elemental mutual coupling effects than in the corresponding passive case. Using a simple transistor equivalent network, it is predicted that as the limit of ideal transistors is approached the input impedance of the active array should exhibit less variation with frequency."
"Experimental data on the quadrifilar helix antenna have led to an optimum pitch angle and an optimum ground plane size. The ground plane size is an important parameter, and its optimum diameter is about three times the diameter of the helix. The optimum pitch angle is about35\\deg. Beam patterns and ellipticity data are given for the optimized model. Bandwidth is about 4:1."
"Polarization twisting reflectors, or twist reflectors, consisting of a wire grid spaced approximately3 \\lambda/8from a ground plane [1], [2] have a bandwidth of at most 30 percent. It is shown that the inclusion of an additional wire grid in front of the first grid makes bandwidths of 100 percent possible. Design formulas, theoretical performance in terms of cross polarization attenuation, and some experimental results for a twist reflector with two wire grids are given."
"The high-frequency backscattered far field produced by a plane electromagnetic wave obliquely incident on a perfectly conducting infinite strip is considered. A comparison is made between the results obtained by applying Keller's and Ufimtsev's asymptotic theories. It is shown that Ufimtsev's expansion is incorrect beyond the leading term, but that the discrepancy is numerically small. The implications in caustic matchings for more complicated shapes, such as finite cones and disks, are briefly discussed."
"The recent model due to Shen, Wu, and King for the current distribution along the asymmetrically-driven thin cylindrical antenna is used in the calculation of current and far-field values for several cases of interest. The graphs show how the current distribution approaches the limiting sinusoidal assumption as the generator location is moved toward a free end. The antenna conductor thickness is shown to cause decaying sinusoidal variations on the radiation fields from the half-and full-wave dipoles having large excitation asymmetries. The model was found to yield accurate current amplitudes for dipoles at least0.30\\lambdain total lengths; however, the current phase is inaccurate for points closer than about0.025\\lambdafrom a free end. This latter value is also the restriction on how close the generator may be from the free end."
"A Fourier transform approach is used to derive the bistatic radar scattering cross section of a slightly rough perfectly conducting infinite surface. A perturbation expansion is used to apply the boundary conditions, and the scattered fields are asympotically evaluated by means of the method of stationary phase. The resultant expression for the radar cross section\\sigma^{0}is shown to agree with that obtained using the method as outlined by Rice."
"Extensive theoretical far-field amplitude and phase data are presented for the monostatic scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave normally incident upon a thin circular metallic disk. These data are used to synthesize the impulse response of the disk. Comparisons are made with various approximate techniques in both the frequency and time domains."
"Periodically loaded transmission line theory is employed to indicate a loading scheme for broad banding a linear dipole antenna. A conjugate reactance load element (negative inductance) is suggested and a design concept developed. Numerical techniques are used to solve Hallen's integral equation, and it is shown that a broad-band (8:1 frequency range) dipole with broadside radiation and VSWR < 2 can be realized."
"The reflection and transmission coefficients for the incidentHwave on an anisotropic plasma half-space moving normal to the interface are investigated theoretically. Several numerical results are presented and it is found that the behavior of the transmission coefficient is a strong function of the motion of the anisotropic plasma half-space."
"The ratio between the excitation factors of vertically and horizontally polarized sources is equal to the squared ratio between the characteristic impedance of free space and the ground level coupling impedance of TE and TM field components. This relation provides an analytical check of numerically calculated excitation factors. Also, the need of directly calculating the two excitation factors of an anisotropic environment may be obviated if the excitation factor of an isotropic environment is used for estimating the dominant field components of a given quasi-TM or quasi-TE mode."
"A perturbation analysis is employed to obtain a modal equation for diffraction by a perfectly conducting cylindrical surface with a sinusoidal perturbation of the height profile. It is found that the surface impedance concept has a measure of validity in describing the fields averaged over one period of the surface."
"A theoretical calculation provides an estimate of the contribution of atmospheric water vapor to the structure parameter of the index of refraction for microwave frequencies. For altitudes below about 10 km this contribution is generally dominant. The relationship between the structure parameters for temperature and index of refraction is considered for a moist atmosphere."
"A formulation for the electromagnetic fields of finite linear antennas of arbitrary length immersed in a dissipative halfspace (such as the ocean or the earth) is presented. The electric fields in either medium can be readily evaluated once the current distribution is assumed or prescribed. The fields are given in each medium for each of the three major subdivisions of the horizontal range, the near-field range, the intermediate range, and the asymptotic range. Antenna patterns obtained from computer results using formulas derived in this paper are presented for some typical submerged linear antennas. These computer results are compared with experimental measurements performed with linear antennas submerged in the Atlantic Ocean."
"An unusual family of line-source aperture excitations are described which provide, maximum aperture efficiency for a given sidelobe level. The emphasis is on the direct description of the excitation functions. The simplicity of the new excitation provides insight into the role of certain excitation components with respect to aperture utilization and sidelobe level. The proposed excitations are evaluated and are found to be comparable with the most efficient excitations previously described."
"A numerical study to determine accuracy and modeling criteria for the integral-equation analysis of thin-wire scatterers is described. Results obtained using a collocation solution method with sinusoidal current interpolation show that 6-18 current samples per wavelength are sufficient to produce radar cross section results with absolute numerical convergence accuracies on the order of 10 percent or less (\\sim0.4dB) depending upon structure complexity."
"An experimental study has been made of the intensity distribution in the focal region of a wide-angle paraboloid reflector illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave of wavelength 12.5 mm. Intensity distributions given by the transverse field components were measured along the axis of the mirror and in several transverse planes. The corresponding distributions given by the longitudinal component were also measured. Experimental results have been found to compare well with available theoretical calculations in the transverse planes. Along the axis, better agreement was obtained after the theoretical calculations had been modified."
"Recent measured results for long baselines are compared with theoretical predictions of interferometer phase fluctuations. The measured values, from the Green Bank observatory in West Virginia, are somewhat smaller than predicted from refractivity spectra data gathered earlier in Colorado. The affects of different lengths and observation times are predicted quite well. It is particularly significant that theory based on the \"frozen turbulence\" model is so successful in predicting fluctuations over an 11-km baseline."
"By loading a long wire with several impedances, the scattered field of the wire may be changed so that a more desirable scattering pattern is obtained. A simple design procedure and formulas relevant to this method are presented."
"Midday measurements of 4- and 6-GHz radio signals which have propagated over a common 26.4-mi path indicate that the scintillation amplitude is normally distributed in dB with a standard deviation in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 dB. Attempts to determine the frequency dependence of these amplitude statistics were confounded by nonstationarity of the propagating media and signal level, the appearance of additional loss mechanisms, and by a nonuniform data recording rate. The tentative indication is that the amplitude fluctuations do increase slightly with increasing frequency in these microwave bands."
"A comparison was made between 10- and 14.43-GHz microwave relay performance in northeastern Mississippi during periods of heavy rainfall. Rainfall rate on the 4.7-km test path was obtained from 20 tipping-bucket gages. Measured attenuation (in dB) at 14.43 GHz was approximately twice that observed at 10 GHz when the rainfall rate exceeded 50 mm/h."
 "Solutions to Maxwell's equations are obtained for the electromagnetic fields independent ofzin media for which the permittivity variation in circular-cylindrical coordinates is as\\rho^{-2}g(\\phi)."
"Scattering by a semi-infinite perfectly conducting wedge with rounded edge is formulated for line-source excitation using the boundary-value approach. Numerical results are presented for the important case of monostatic plane-wave scattering in the far field. These results comprise principal-polarization data plotted as a function of aspect angle for60\\deg,90\\deg, and120\\degwedges with maximum roundingkaof 4, wherekais the electrical radius of curvature of the edge. Observations uniformly conform with qualitative predictions based upon simple scattering arguments. It is shown thatkaas small as 0.8 can double the sharp wedge result at symmetrical incidence, although the effect of rounding is markedly dependent upon polarization and wedge angle. Forka \\leq 1, the solution is viewed as the sharp wedge result plus a perturbation field which exhibits simple parametric dependencies. In particular, the aspect dependence of these perturbations can be accurately extracted. The present work is a preliminary step in extension of high-frequency asymptotic theory to finite targets having rounded as well as sharp edges."

"A procedure for computing the characteristic modes for conducting bodies of arbitrary shape is developed. The method is applied to conducting bodies of revolution and to wire objects, and general computer programs are discussed. Illustrative examples of the computation of characteristic currents and characteristic fields are given for a cone-sphere, a disk, and a wire arrow. Modal solutions using these modes are computed for representative antenna and scattering problems to illustrate convergence of the solution as the number of modes is increased."
 "A ten-element array of log-periodic monopole antennas with a power gain of about 20 dB is described. The individual elements are designed for input continuous wave (or peak) powers of 200 kW and differ somewhat from previous monopole configurations. The array element spacing is adjusted so that when it is electronically scanned in synchronism with the associated receiving array all side and grating lobes of the two-way pattern are down at least 20 dB. Element, array, and ground screen designs are discussed, as well as the model array mutual coupling measurements, electronic scanning systems and the associated coaxial transmission lines."
"It is hypothesized that the exact shape of the center conductor of a sandwich-wire antenna, provided it is of fairly simple form, is not important in determining the radiating properties of the antenna. An analysis is therefore made by standard principles of a sandwich-wire antenna having a particularly simple shape for the center conductor. This approach leads to an explicit formula for the structure attenuation constant in terms of its geometrical parameters which may be used for design purposes. Experimental measurements which support the theory and justify the shape-independence hypothesis are presented."
"The results obtained by modeling a linear array as an infinite periodic structure can be used for the analysis of finite arrays as the zero-order approximation of a perturbation technique. This idea is utilized to investigate the edge effects in two arrays of uniform slits fed by parallel-plate waveguides terminated on a ground plane. It is shown that the realized gain pattern of an element depends substantially upon its position in the array. This is true particularly for the deep resonance notches in the patterns which are present for certain element spacings. When the array is excited with uniform magnitude and linear phase, the aperture voltages are the superposition of a term, corresponding to the infinite array model, plus another correction term (a \"spatial transient\") representing the edge effect. The influence of this term is particularly relevant when the array is scanned at endfire. In such a case, the method introduced here allows the prediction of the element terminal admittances and the array pattern, while according to the infinite array model no radiation would be permitted."
"Two-dimensional periodic arrays of dipoles or slots act as reflecting or transmitting surfaces, respectively, which have bandpass filter characteristics. The resonant frequency and the bandwidth may be controlled by varying the length, spacing, and load impedance of the dipoles (slots). A theoretical and experimental investigation of the scattering by a two-dimensional array of loaded dipoles is described. The scattering through the resonance region shows that a unit reflection coefficient is achieved. The effect of grating-lobe radiation is included. The scattering properties as a function of the angle of incidence are given for both loaded and unloaded dipoles. The loaded dipole array described in this paper produces a narrower bandwidth than the array of unloaded dipoles, and the resonant frequency is much less dependent on the angle of incidence. The resonant frequency of the array as well as the bandwidth depends strongly on the resonant frequency of the dipole element as would be expected; however, it is also substantially influenced by the interelement spacing and the angle of incidence."
"Although the diameter of the sun at microwavelengths is a little over half a degree, the sun can be used for establishing, say between 3 and 30 cm, the pointing corrections (boresight calibration) of microwave antennas, with high precision. There is, however, a discrepancy between the position of the microwave sun on any given day and the position of the center of the solar disc as tabulated in [16]. Over the period 1966-1969 this discrepancy had an rms value of 1.6' east-west and 1.2' north-south and a range of 11.4' east-west and 9.2' north-south. These conclusions are based on sun maps, made at 9.1 cm with an antenna having a beamwidth of approximately 3', which are published regularly. From such a map the microwave centroid can be determined with an error less than 1'. In the absence of such a map, the centroid can be estimated to within 2' or slightly better by taking account of optical data such as sunspots or plages. The correction on any one day is strongly correlated with that of the day before, but the correlation is small after about 5 days. The correlation returns in part after 27 days."
"The distribution of current, admittance, and far field of a shunt-driven circular loop antenna are derived and related to those of an equivalent series-driven loop in parallel with a section of transmission line. The effective length of a shunt-loaded receiving antenna is obtained in terms of the corresponding quantity for the series-loaded loop."
"The problem of signal reflection from a conducting plane in random oscillation is considered. The mean reflected signal is found to depend, in general, on the characteristic function of the stochastic process that describes the random oscillation of the conducting plane. Asymptotic expressions for the mean reflected signal are derived. For a monochromatic signal it is shown that the amplitude of the reflected signal depends on the ratio between the wavelength and the rms displacement of the conducting plane from its mean position. Also, from the mean reflected signal, information about the statistical properties of the random oscillation may be obtained under certain conditions."
"A theory of characteristic modes for conducting bodies is developed starting from the operator formulation for the current. The mode currents form a weighted orthogonal set over the conductor surface, and the mode fields form an orthogonal set over the sphere at infinity. It is shown that the modes are the same ones introduced by Garbacz to diagonalize the scattering matrix of the body. Formulas for the use of these modes in antenna and scatterer problems are given. For electrically small and intermediate size bodies, only a few modes are needed to characterize the electromagnetic behavior of the body."

Equations for both straight and curved wires are readily derived using a Fourier transform."
 "A study of the backscattering from two identical perfectly conducting, thin wires illuminated by a plane wave at an arbitrary angle of incidence is presented. The theory is based on an integral equation method. By decomposing the induced currents into symmetric and antisymmetric modes, the simultaneous integral equations for the induced currents are converted into independent integral equations similar to the one for a single wire for which the solution has already been carried out. The induced currents on and the backscattering cross sections of the wires are determined. Numerical examples include nonstaggered, staggered, and collinear cases of both half-wave and full-wave wires. Comparisons are made between the calculated and measured values of the echo area. The experimental results are in good agreement with theory."
"A detailed investigation of the differences between the upwind and downwind Doppler spectra of the radar sea echo has been made, utilizingP-,L-, andC-band data obtained with the Naval Research Laboratory's Four-Frequency Radar System. The results indicate that while the Doppler bandwidth is nearly independent of wind direction, the differential Doppler looking upwind is nearly twice that for the downwind case."
"Utilizing time discrimination techniques, atmospheric layers have been resolved with bistatic and monostatic radars over common regions. The results also indicate the importance of time resolution in bistatic probes to distinguish main beam common volume scattering from that due to sidelobes."
"The field structure of a buried vertical oscillating magnetic dipole is examined. The earth is represented as a two-layer half-space, and the source is located in the bottom semi-infinite region. Using numerical integration, the magnitude of the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical magnetic field is examined for an observer on the earth's surface. It is shown that at sufficiently low frequencies, the field ratio is not appreciably modified by the finite conductivity and the geometry of the layers."
"The multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves by two-body target configurations has been studied in terms of their sub-nanosecond pulse returns. The wide-band response of targets has been computed through the use of an asymptotic solution to simple two-body scattering problems and is discussed with emphasis on target coupling phenomenon. Low-order coupling components between bodies were isolated experimentally through use of a coherentX-band high-resolution radar system, and the results are generally in good agreement with the analytical solutions."
"A numerical solution for the problem of scattering of a plane wave by a dielectric sheet with an imbedded periodic array of conducting strips is presented. The primary motivation for introducing the strips is to reinforce the mechanical hardness of the sheet in certain radome applications. The study shows that with proper design the additional strips can also improve the electric transmission through the composite structure."

The numerical results agree well with those of Balmain at low frequencies. The range of validity of the method is given."
"It is possible to obtain polarization diversity from one multiple arm logarithmic-spiral antenna. The log-spiral antenna with more than 2 arms can be excited by a single hybrid matrix connected to the antenna terminals at the origin of the antenna geometry, and operated such that currents flow on the arms with phase progression away from the origin and reflected currents flow back along the arms with phase progression toward the origin. These two components of current radiate fields of opposite sense of essentially circular polarization."
"The dyadic Green's functions of Maxwell's equations in anisotropic media are found by a perturbation technique. The solutions are in Taylor's series which may be summed in closed form in the case of uniaxial crystal media. When the medium is biaxial or gyrotropic, approximation by partial sum may be used. The approximate solutions give the near fields in elementary functions, Which may be used to solve integral equations arising from scattering and radiation problems."

"The far field of point current sources ofa_{\\rho},a_{\\phi}, anda_{z}orientation either internal or external to a dielectric right-circular cylinder are discussed. Simplified general solutions are developed via plane-wave scattering in conjunction with the principle of reciprocity. Radiation patterns for axially oriented sources are illustrated. The results are found to embrace several prior special-condition solutions by others and to refute one previous analysis."
"The problem investigated here is that of calculating the input impedance of a thin vertical center-fed half-wave dipole over a dissipative ground. A variational expression for the input impedance is found which is valid for heights above the ground as small asd\\lambda = 0.3(in many cases the limit is smaller than this) and for refractive indices such that|n|^{2} \\geq 10. Using a zeroth-order trial function, a closed-form expression which represents the change in the input impedance of the antenna between the case of a perfectly conducting ground and the case of a dissipative ground is found."
"Antenna imaging by a finite ground is investigated analytically and numerically by considering a conical monopole antenna above a finite hemispherical ground of variable radius. The ratioY_{t}/Y_{t \\infty}of the terminating admittance of the antenna over a finite to that over an infinite ground is evaluated and plotted versus the ground radius for various monopole lengths. The plots provide a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of finite screens in imaging antennas."

"The design construction and testing of a wide-band circularly polarized antenna suitable for ionospheric research is described. The antenna operates in the range 2 to 7 MHz. Simple design formulas are given for the required broad-band phase shifting networks. Broad-band dipole antennas are used and suitable \"balancing networks\" are developed to match these antennas to the phase shifting networks ever the frequency range. A satisfactory compromise solution is found to the problem of matching the networks to the receiver using a broad-band transformer. Measurements of the rejection ratio of the system show that it is always better than approximately 16:1 over the required frequency range."
"An analysis is presented of multiple interleaved arrays of waveguide radiators operating at different frequencies. The approach is a generalization of the analysis of an infinite array at a single frequency. The presence of the low-frequency elements affects the radiation characteristics of the high-frequency elements and generates grating lobes which do not appear in a single-frequency array. Furthermore, power is coupled 'into the low-frequency waveguides when the high-frequency elements are excited. Numerical examples are presented which show that these effects are not severe."
"The characteristics of the radome-enclosed Haystack antenna have been evaluated as a radio-astronomical instrument. Important advantages of the radome enclosure are the high pointing precision it permits under all wind conditions, the rms pointing errors being 7\" in azimuth and elevation, and the antenna surface tolerance (0.027 in rms) made possible by controlled environment. We searched for but failed to find any detectable radome effects as follows: pointing deviations, gain variations, noise granularity, and polarization effects. The principal electromagnetic effect of the radome is a reduction of aperture efficiency by an amount that varies from about 1 dB at long wavelengths to 2.8 dB at 35 GHz. The noise contribution is about9\\degK at 8 GHz and21\\degK at 22.2 GHz."
"A numerical-integral equation approach is used to explore plane-wave scattering from a nonplanar surface with a sinusoidal height profile for the case of the magnetic field parallel to the surface ridges (TM polarization). The results are compared to those found previously by the authors for the TE polarization. The TM case is more sensitive to the height of the sinusoid and shows shape resonate effects which are characterized by a large increases in the surface current. A \"Brewster angle\" complete null of the specular reflection is also present and tends to be broader and more strongly emphasizes the anomalies which occur at the Rayleigh wavelengths. The failure of two anomalies to coalesce at the crossing of two Rayleigh wavelength conditions is also explored."
"Microwave holography is an extension of the optical holography to the microwave field. In fact, by using a well-known characteristic of the holographic process, it is possible to record the hologram at frequencies very far from the optical region (microwave) and to reconstruct a visible image by laser light. This paper describes the experimental apparatus and the technique used for obtaining a satisfactory optical wave reconstruction from microwave holograms. The resolving power of the system which was experimentally tested, and visible images of microwave transparencies and of a back scattering object are given. As an alternative application of the microwave holography together with the optical wave reconstruction, in this paper, extension of holographic interferometry to the microwave region is suggested, and the visible image of a deformed object crossed by fringes due to microwave interference is also shown. This technique can find applications, for instance, in the mapping of the earth's deformations or in that of the tides. Different aspects of the microwave holographic interferometry have been also discussed."
"A consequence of a recently discovered edge condition for planar apertures is that all planar aperture distributions are separable physically into a product of an edge factor and an aperture space factor, analogous to the way in which the radiation pattern separates into a product of an element factor and a pattern space factor. An exact relationship between these aperture and pattern space factors for physically realizable vector fields is derived here for rectangular and for circular apertures. For rectangular apertures it leads to a two-dimensional set of doubly orthogonal functions that are characteristic of the aperture geometry. Characteristic functions for circular apertures, however, are shown to exist only if the vector fields are circularly symmetric, although for scalar fields they exist for completely arbitrary aperture distributions with arbitrary edge taper. For rectangular apertures the characteristic functions consist of products of spheroidal functions and for circular apertures they are obtained from a generalization of the spheroidal functions. Some of the properties of these generalized spheroidal functions are developed here."
"Discontinuity effects are analyzed after referring the ionospheric surface impedance of daytime and nighttime waveguide portions to the same common altitudeh. The properties of the waveguide junction are determined by field matching, and the resulting linear equations are rearranged in a form that permits a sequential determination of transmission and reflection coefficients. Simple dominant mode approximations of the transmission and reflection coefficients are also developed. Field calculations of reciprocal geometries illustrate the consistency of the formulation and reflection coefficients are found to be of negligible magnitudes. The discontinuous surface impedance tends to excite higher order waveguide modes of larger amplitudes than a ground based source in homogeneous waveguide."
"Long-distance radio communication at VHF is investigated by the waveguide mode theory taking into account the strong gradient, layered structure of the troposphere. A linear-segmented numerical method for the squared refractive index profile is developed to calculate the wave modes. This method reduces the reflection error from the discontinuities that occur in the conventional step-function approximation. The frequency at which only one mode is reasonably well trapped is used to determine the lowest usable frequency for tropospheric communication. It is found that such communication is possible at almost all VHF frequencies when the refractive index contrast (\\Delta n) is greater than40Nunits. However, if\\Delta nis reduced to10Nunits or less, the troposphere is almost transparent for VHF radio signals. The received field in terms of the field in free space is calculated for antennas located either above or below the layer. It is shown that various long-distance radio observations can be explained by whispering-gallery modes in the troposphere."
"The method of moments is applied to the problem of broad-band dipole design. For electrically small antennas, top-loaded geometries appear to maximize bandwidth. For dimensions of the order of a wavelength, a class of dipole shapes is given which yields a VSWR of less than 1.1 with respect to a100-\\Omegatransmission line over a frequency range of 1.8 to 1. The beam shape is essentially that of a dipole over the band."
"A measurement program conducted to observe the effects of mutual coupling on element VSWR in a three element linear log periodic dipole antenna array is described. The data collected are presented as a function of frequency, interelement spacing, and scan angle."
"The use of blinders to reduce certain high sidelobes in the azimuth (transverse) plane radiation for horizontal (transverse) polarization is discussed. A half blinder is presented which reduces objectionable high sidelobes 8 to -62 dB, and maintains low sidelobes elsewhere."
"A method is described by which automatically retrodirective performance may be obtained from circular arrays and circularly continuous aperture antennas. The method is also directly applicable to cylindrical antennas for two-dimensional retrodirectivity and is generalized to include a method for obtaining three-dimensional retrodirectivity. Both passive and active systems are possible, and control of the reradiated beam characteristics may be provided."
"The characteristics of the propagating waves on an array of identical wires have been measured. Experimental data showed that propagating waves could be supported on the structure without significant attenuation for two frequency bands. The central frequency of the higher passband was about 3 times higher than that of the lower passband. All propagating waves were slow waves. Phase velocities were varied from 0.99 to 0.25 of the free-space velocity. Thek-\\betadiagram of the waves were obtained and were found in good agreement with the theory."
"An alternative derivation of Mei's extension of Hallen's integral equation to describe thin wire antennas of arbitrary geometry is presented."
"For synchronous satellites a new type of antenna formed around the apogee motor nozzle and operating simultaneously at 40 and 360 MHz has been designed.

"The first-order admittances of a coaxially driven infinite monopole, both in the exact formY_{a\\infty}(1) and the approximate formY_{TEM\\infty}(1), are shown to vanish. The slope of(Y_{a\\infty} - Y_{TEM\\infty)against (b/a - 1) is, therefore, zero asb/a\\rightarrow 1. This bridges the heretofore little understood region between 1) the exactly known limiting value forb/a = 1, and 2) the values forb/a > 1which can be calculated numerically."
"Theoretical analyses of the scattering of the electromagnetic waves from rough surfaces have progressed using basically the Kirchhoff approach (KA) and the small perturbation method (SPM) of Rice. It is demonstrated that the latter method (SPM) is actually a special case of the former (KA). Reasons why SPM agrees with experimental data near grazing angle are given and arguments are made for the invalidity of the SPM second-order depolarized term."
"The backscattering from a rectangular plate at edge-on incidence is due essentially to the individual contributions from the front and trailing edges. The contribution of the front edge is analogous to that of a wire illuminated by a plane wave, but the rear edge excitation is almost wholly determined by current waves along the side edges of the plate."
"The use of a rail line scattering range which consists of a flat parallel conductor transmission line is discussed. Accuracy limitations of the range are considered and examples are given of typical applications."
"The spatial correlation of amplitude of one-hop HF radio waves, propagated via the ionosphere with a 2077 km ground range, has been measured using three receivers positioned at the corners of a triangle. The spatial correlation was found to be approximately isotropic for spacings up to 1 km. The antenna spacing at the 0.5 level of amplitude correlation was greater than 3 km if the shape of the spatial correlation contours were assumed to be independent of spacing."
"The electromagnetic fields of a vertical electric dipole in a conducting half-space are considered. A numerical method for predicting the transfer between two receiving sites is outlined and the results are applied to a configuration used in an experimental test over the frequency range from 1 to 10 MHz."
"A simple approximate formula for the height above the earth'S surface of a radio ray propagating through a spherically stratified smoothly varying atmosphere is derived. For the purpose of illustration an exponential model atmosphere is numerically evaluated, and examples show the significant improvement that resuits compared with the usual \"effective earth's radius\" approximations, especially for large surface gradients. Key words in this communication are ray tracing, troposphere, and approximate height."

                                  "A new type of polarization converting antenna has been introduced. This antenna receives vertically polarized signals and re-radiates it with horizontal polarization, or vice-versa. This type of polarization converting antenna is useful for responder applications. The responder is a passive version of a transponder. The background noise or spurious echo is effectively removed by this type of antenna. The mode converting antenna can be utilized in the \"in-line\" mode or in the \"reflection\" mode. In the in-line mode, the antenna is placed between the transmitter and the receiver. In the reflection mode operation, the antenna is facing both the transmitter and the receiver which are on the same side. A direct coupled vertical/horizontal half-wave dipole antenna of 32mm long in-each direction was constructed and tested in the reflection mOde. The vertical element receives the vertically polarized waves and excites the horizontal element which is directly coupled to the vertical element at the current maximum point. The test frequency was 9.12 -9.745 GHz . The vertical to horizontal conversion loss was 15db but the signal to noise ration improvement, was more than 30 db."
        "Summary form only given, as follows. Mathematical expressions are derived, using geometric optics approximations, for the reflected rays from different parts of the parabolic reflector when a plane wave is incident from a specific direction. The region of minimum aberration and the value of this aberration has been determined for rays symmetrically distributed on and around the symmetry plane, The degree of aberration has been proven to yield knowledge which is of sufficient accuracy to determine the extent of the active region of the field distribution around the focal area of the reflector. The dispersion characteristics of the reflector when fed off the focal point may also be determined. The points of intersection and the mid points of minimum aberration of the previously described rays are presented in figures to describe the volume and extent of the active region, off the focal area of the reflector. These points are illustrated as a function of the offset angle of the main beam. Interesting conclusions may be derived concerning the required feed arrangements for multiple beams and the positions for achieving high isolation between these beams. Making use of a computer program together with approximate assumptions for the relation between geometric optics approximations and the actual field distribution it was possible to describe the phase distribution at these off-focus regions. These approximate distributions are of prime importance in generating concepts of feed arrangements for antennas which make use of multiple beams."

  "An Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Identity, based on the Physical Optics Approximation, is developed for the monostatic scattered far field cross section of perfect conductors. Uniqueness of this inverse identity is proven. This identity requires complete scattering information for all frequencies and aspect angles. An integral equation is developed for the arbitrary case of incomplete frequency and/or aspect angle scattering information. A general closed form solution to this integral equation is developed, which yields the shape of the scatterer from such incomplete information. A specific practical radar solution is presented. The resolution of this solution is developed; yielding short-pulse target resolution radar system parameter equations. Special cases, such as a priori knowledge of scatterer symmetry, are treated in some detail. The merits of this solution over the conventional radar imaging technique are discussed."

"Among the techniques employed to estimate the stock size of pelagic fishes, acoustics has proven to be the most versatile and cost effective method. Furthermore, modern digital data processing equipment is paving the way for accurate onboard estimates of fish densities thus providing for optimum utilization of ship time and scientific personnel. Echo integration is a method of estimating fish densities acoustically, which, unlike echo counting, improves with increasing density. A Digital Data Acquisition and Processing System (DDAPS) has been developed at the University of Washington to implement the integration technique in real-time for two echo-sounders and 10 depth strata simultaneously. The system, which includes a small GP computer, contains other important features such as an automatic bottom following facility."
"Submersibles provide a direct means of studying the living ocean resources. Basic submersible types include bathyscaphs, bathyspheres, tethered propelled subs and self-contained subs. Biological scientists require a submersible that is stable, can pinpoint and maintain its position, has variable speed with long endurance and provide excellent viewing and data monitoring systems. Few existing subs meet these needs. Subs can be used to monitor resources not available to other sampling gear, observe relationships of animals to their environment, and determine characteristics of conventional sampling gear. Sophisticated support vessels and diver lockout features will improve the versatility of new generation submersibles."
"The quantitative assessment of fish stocks by acoustic signals is the most promising method of stock assessment for large areas of water. A prototype, SAS-I (stock assessment system) was put into operation April 1970 aboard the R/V Oregon II. It is a computer controlled data acquisition and reduction system which receives its source signal from the ship's echo sounder and prints out in tabular form summation of target intensities for six depth regions and individual dimensions of each school encountered."
"Of all the groups of animals considered as subjects for a radio tracking study, marine mammals probably present the greatest challenge to the engineer and biologist. In addition to special packaging problems associated with operating in the ocean, the fact that marine mammals spend most of their time submerged essentially precludes transmitting at RF frequencies. During the past 36 months, a series of systems specifically for use on a variety of marine mammals in the open sea have been designed and tested under field conditions. This paper discusses the design of the radio transmitter and receiver system, frequency, power, packaging and antenna requirements, and discusses data on respiration rate, pattern and maximum depth of dive collected from several instrumented cetaceans."
"Application of a coherent Correlation Echo Sounder Processor (CESP) to high resolution depth sounding in particularly noisy environments is discussed.

"This paper describes the development of a range-bearing acoustic receiver used to relocate a single underwater transponder, navigation beacon or pinger. Basically a hydrophone array consisting of two crossed dipoles and associated signal processing electronics determine the bearing of a pulse of sinusoidal acoustic energy by phase comparison techniques. This technique provides operation over a full360\\degsector without ambiguous results. The physical size of the hydrophone array is relatively small since spacing between elements is less than half a wavelength (at 10 kHz,\\lambda \\doteq 6inches). It will be shown that the physical and signal processing parameters can be arranged so as to display in analog form a180\\degbearing sector on a180\\degsection of a250\\degdeflection meter movement. Range to the underwater device is determined by measurement of total travel time taking into account equipment decision time."
"A method is presented for digitally simulating zero-mean stationary Gaussian data from an array of hydrophones. The data will exhibit prescribed temporal and spatial correlation to within an arbitrarily small error. In this method a Fourier series having a period greater than twice the simulation interval is constructed at each hydrophone. At each frequency, the technique uses independent numbers from a random number generator to construct Fourier coefficients exhibiting the prescribed spatial correlation. Upper bounds on the covariance error are given as a function of the period of the series and the characteristics of the model. The error due to truncating the series is also considered. Aside from this truncation error, it is determined that the simulation can yield zero error when the period of the series is at least twice the maximum correlation-time interval in the acoustic field."
"Guidelines are needed for the development and protection of Pacific Northwest Estuaries. An inventory of estuarine conditions and resources should be completed and evaluated before industrial construction is permitted. In response to this requirement, Oregon State University under the National Sea Grant Program has initiated a study to measure the characteristics of the estuarine waters of the state. An approach to the determination of the predominent physical, chemical and biological parameters of these waters is presented. Parameters measured, equipment selected or developed and measurement techniques are described in some detail. Implication of the conditions found are discussed."
"Single-ship oceanographic cruises give way more and more to synoptic studies of the oceans. This new style of exploration is made possible by the appearance of the digital computer and its application in marine science in the last decade. High speed digital computers are not only utilized for faster processing of conventionally acquired data, but particularly in building descriptive and predictive models of the oceans and the atmosphere. It is hoped that the next decade will see a greater exploitation of the opportunities provided by computers by teams of scientists from different nations, to approach the major scientific questions of the environment on a global scale. These programs will require state-of-the-art technology, and will require adoption of organization and management methods developed for industry and somewhat more autocratic than is traditional in the scientific community. A focal point for such a new approach to marine science and for meeting the challenge of the Seventies is the NSF's Office for the International Decade of Ocean Exploration in which the United States and other participating nations will apply their combined resources to expand their knowledge of the earth's marine environment for their mutual benefit. Three major elements of the Office's program are described here. They are: the MidOcean Dynamics Experiment, the Coastal Upwelling Experiment, and the Paleo-oceanographic Project. Scientific and technical program details are highlighted in this paper and an outlook for future operations is provided."
"Accurately surveying the physical properties of the ocean and estuaries is one of the primary functions of the National Ocean Survey. Because of the long delay between acquiring the data and publishing the results when the acquired data is processed manually, the National Ocean Survey, like others in this field, has turned to automation. This paper will discuss what has been accomplished during the last decade in the area of survey automation."
"The question is asked \"Why is equipment still being lost in shallow water?\" A tentative answer is given that users expect both too much and too little from existing electronic relocation devices and techniques. These expectations are discussed through a review of the types of electronic devices and techniques now commercially available. Included are discussions of active and passive sonar systems (diver-held and shipboard) as well as visual, magnetic, and radio frequency aids. Exploration of the status of frequency standardization in selected mission equipment will be briefly mentioned. The role of the computer in devising search patterns and in estimating relocation probabilities is also noted. Selected case histories of both successful and unsuccessful shallow water relocation operations are presented to illustrate problem areas and potential solutions. A projection is made of future applications in which relocation of equipment in shallow water will become increasingly important."
"The Marine Physical Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, has developed an acoustic relay transponder for precise relative positioning of nearbottom instruments and geologic sampling devices. Although specifically designed to locate equipment lowered on standard wire ropes without a need to maintain direct electrical contact with the surface vessel, the relay transponder may be used to track free vehicles, such as deep submersibles, from the surface. The relay transponder is positioned relative to an array of bottom-anchored acoustic transponders. It is interrogated acoustically from the surface vessel; it then sequentially interrogates the bottom transponders which, in turn, reply to the surface vessel. From the measurement of the total travel time involved and assuming (or knowing) the sound velocity of the water, we obtain a relayed range measurement. These relayed ranges, used in conjunction with ship to bottom-transponder ranges, allow us to calculate the position of the relay transponder. A recent application of this technique is described in which several gravity core samples from the crest of Horizon Guyot were positioned with respect to the detailed bathymetry and the geology within the area. The estimated error in positioning the samples is less than 25 m inside a navigational net extending over 100 km square."
"An automatic, nuclear powered underwater acoustic beacon and data telemetry system has been developed as part of a Navy oceanographic project by the Naval Underwater Systems Center (New London Laboratory). This system, developed to meet the loan requirements of the Atomic Energy Commission, serves a dual purpose. The system's primary function is to provide timed acoustic pulses for the exact positioning determination of various hydrophones on an underwater array. The second function is to measure internal temperatures of the nuclear generator along with other parameters. On a predetermined schedule, these data are converted to a coded binary bit form and are acoustically transmitted as pulse tones to the array. The coded signal is received by the array and then relayed to a manned shore station via cable to be decoded and displayed. Unique features of this system include: (1) the use of state-of-the-art electronic components, designed for low power consumption and maximum efficiency, (2) compact design to fit within the pressure vessel of a SNAP-21 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), and (3) provisions for high accuracy and flexibility."
"The impact of brine effluent from large desalting plants on the marine biota of coastal environments is reviewed. Increased salinity and temperature and the presence of heavy metals such as iron, copper and nickel are properties of waste brine which impose a potential stress on marine ecosystems. The results of engineering studies have shown that the harmful effects of waste brine can be minimized or eliminated by diluting the effluent with cooling water from the heat exchangers; by employing properly designed outfalls which will rapidly disperse the brine; and By using chelation or ion exchange systems to remove trace metals before the brine is discharged into the sea."
"In this paper, simulation techniques are applied to evaluate fixed-time and sequential detection schemes for communication over the surface scattering undersea acoustic channel under small signal-to-noise ratio conditions for the case of a \"very rough\" surface. The results show that sequential detection yields great increases in the transmission rate at the expense of a large variance in the average symbol transmission time."
"The International Tsunami Warning System has remained virtually unchanged since its inception in 1946. It operates relatively slowly--by modern communications standards--and can only qualitatively distinguish between small, moderate or severe tsunamis. Recent technological and theoretical developments suggest that its effectiveness could be greatly increased through the use of satellite communications, automatic data aquisition and transmission, and computerized pre-calculation of wave effects."
"A high speed digital data system, incorporating some novel features such as duobinary baseband transmission, has been designed for at-sea underwater acoustic measurements. The system performance requirements, configuration, functional blocks and in-use results are outlined in this paper. While the equipment described uses a coaxial cable between the underwater unit and the recording ship, the design is adaptable to R.F. telemetry techniques using a free-floating or moored buoy."
"The heterogeneous nature of the sea ice surface with respect to topography and reflectivity characteristics poses serious problems in interpreting radar returns to the precision needed for modern transportation over the polar ice pack. The physical properties of sea ice are discussed. A swept frequency technique is used to determine the electromagnetic properties of3.5\\permilsalinity sea ice in the frequency band from 26.5 to 40.0 GHz. Lack of influence by liquid brine is noted in the real part of the complex permittivity at temperatures below-7\\degC; a marked change in dielectric loss is noted with change in the orientation of the liquid brine inclusions in sea ice with respect to the millimeter wave electric field"
"This paper describes: Efforts to integrate Engineering Departments into the institutional Sea Grant Programs at several outstanding universities; Various interpretations of \"Ocean Engineering\" at several universities; Predilections of ocean engineers to study the effects of waves on Pilings; Possible reasons for ignoring the potential of operations research in ocean engineering at these universities; Interrelationships between engineers, scientists, and social scientists in joint projects; and The willingness of a few extraordinary ocean engineers to exercise imaginations and risk reputations in highly innovative undertakings under the Sea Grant Program."
"The transparent hull submersible MAKAKAI has been constructed by the Hawaii Laboratory of Naval Undersea Research and Development Center. Unique features of the submersible are its 66-inch O.D. transparent acrylic pressure hull, its pi-itch cycloidal propulsion system, its environmental cooling system, and its control information transmission systems. The vehicle has an operating depth of 600 feet. Its overall mission goals are to provide a submersible developmental test and demonstration platform for undersea hardware and a working vehicle for scientific personnel."
 "This paper describes an oceanographic and meteorological remote sensing system using remote buoys. The system is subdivided into the following subsystems; primary buoys, secondary buoys or transducers, and a shore computer controlled command system. The most distinguishing feature of the system is the immediate availability of the data to the investigator with no delays caused by the storage of data, and the ability of the investigator to change the sampling rate under varying environmental conditions. An inherent flexibility of the system is the ability of the primary buoys to act as repeater stations for the secondary buoys, thus reducing the power that is needed at the secondary buoys and the cost of the equipment. Data acquisition is controlled by a PDP-15/30 computer as directed by the investigating scientist. The computer will sample any desired parameter at a rate specified by the investigator storing the data in the computer system or graphically displaying it if the scientist desires to examine it. The PDP- 15/30 computer can also simultaneously process the raw data through mathematical or statistical routines into a form desired by the scientist. The primary buoys (having the pseudonym TOTEM) are the main data acquisition points of the system. Each of the primary buoys has 64 analog data channels, which are digitized at the buoy, 32 digital data channels, 32 command channels, 3 continuous analog channels, and a low-speed digital channel (100 bits per second). The primary buoy is controlled via a 600 bit per second VHF/UHF radio data link. Because of limitations of the present radio data link, the data acquisition rate is limited to 40 samples per second using 12 bit data words. Located on the primary buoys are the standard meteorological equipment as anemometers, barometers, air temperature and rain gauges. Oceanographic sensors are mounted on an instrument package that is lowered remotely by the computer measuring sea temperature, currents, turbulence, conductivity, and oxygen content from the surface to 500 meters, and ocean currents and temperature are measured at fixed depths with outriggers attached to the primary buoy. Also located on the buoy are sensors to measure wave height and direction along with other special purpose sensors to measure air-sea interactions and other parameters. The secondary buoys and transducers are designed to transmit data back to the computer through the primary buoys via radio or acoustical links to the primary buoy and by the normal data link to the computer. There is no set physical form for a secondary buoy or transducer as the individual system is tailored to the particular parameters desired and can be located anywhere from the ocean's surface to the ocean's bottom. The system's modular design permits investigators to attach an experiment to the system by inserting a printed circuit board. It should be noted that all of the system described on the primary buoy can operate simultaneously and an optional voice link exists for system maintenance and check out."
"Though severely limited in range by the attenuation of seawater, underwater electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields are being utilized in a wide variety of oceanographic applications. Many present uses of underwater fields are essentially straightforward extensions of land-based applications. Other uses, however, involve techniques that may be applied only in the underwater environment. This paper will survey the various applications which make use of electrostatic and magnetostatic fields as well as the low audio frequency electromagnetic channel."
"Sensitivity of volume bidirectional reflectance of a deep, homogeneous body of water to measurement conditions (solar zenith angle, ratio of sunlight irradiance to skylight irradiance) and medium optical parameters (single scatter albedo, scattering phase function) is analyzed by singular eigenfunction solution of the radiative transport equation. Volume reflectance is shown to be non-Lambertian, and dependent on sunlight/ skylight irradiance ratio. Deviation of volume reflectance from Lambertian behavior is shown to be strongly dependent on phase function peaking, with deviation increasing with peaking. For forward/backward phase function peaking of 180, fractional deviation from Lambertian behavior at30\\degfrom the normal direction is approximately 0.15, at60\\degapproximately 0.30. Fractional change in reflectance magnitude as sunlight/ skylight irradiance ratio changes from 3.00 (hazy sky) to 1.00 (lightly cloudy) is shown to be approximately 0.10."
"An FMCW radar has been modified to measure the height of ocean waves and tides. Originally intended to measure hurricane waves to aid in offshore platform design, this system has the advantage of having no elements in the water. No wave staffs to lose. The80\\degradar beam of 4300 MHz frequency modulated over 70 MHz is reduced in beamwidth to16\\degby additional horns. This beam is reflected from the water surface and an average distance measured as a function of time. The system has been tested on Platform HOPE in the Santa Barbara Channel for eight months. In the absence of large waves, the radar system measured four foot waves and tides. The tide radar data were checked with USC & GS Rincon Island tide measurements. Since the wave or tide data are contained in the frequency of an audio signal, these data can be sent over a telephone line and remotely displayed. A system such as this using a magnetic tape recorder might be used on a number of offshore platforms for wave height monitoring."
"Identification problems occurring in remote sensing systems related to oceanography are examined and stated. Need for taking a broad view of the total problem is emphasized. Alternate methods to solve the identification problems are mentioned. Algorithms derived from optimal estimation theory are applied to identify some of the ocean parameters using microwave radiometer and spectrometer data. Results are presented to show feasibility of the suggested techniques. Need is shown to use distributed parameter representation for the process models."
"The sea relay and weather tower is to overcome problems in communicating by microwave, radio, or sonic waves in water. The system is arranged to interconnect signals received by one means to transmission equipment of each of the three methods stated. The tower is floated horizontally to its location and erected using ballast. The microwave tower is hydraulically ejected into position. The lower end of the tower is at the sonic clear channel depth. Because its buoyancy comes from such a depth, the tower is not affected by wave motion. Each tower may be manned or unmanned. The more obvious uses of these towers are as weather stations; communications between land masses; and submarine communication."
"The Environmental Data Acquisition Telemetry System is a versatile, flexible and economical means to accumulate unattended data from multiple sensors at remote locations over an extended period of time. The data are normally stored on punched paper tape for data reduction and analysis by computer. The basic system consists of a master station and as many as 15 remote stations which can be located as far away as 30 miles (line-of-sight) from the master station. The master station sequentially interrogates the remote stations, and converts the received data to a digital format and stores the data on punched paper tape. The remote station receives the interrogate signal which initiates the transducer sequencing. Various parameters may be measured and the information transmitted via an FM radio link to the master station for processing. Options such as magnetic tape storage, remote display and/or recording, variable scan rate, and additional sensors at the remote station are available."
"The author presented \"A Coding Scheme for Underwater Digital Data Transmission\" at the IEEE ICEOE '70 which was to propose a three valued signal transmission in the underwater environment in order to have low susceptibility against severe fluctuations of transmission speed of the transmission media. This report proposes a coding device for the above three valued code, that is, for Fibonacci Code. Though Fibonacci Code has three levels, it is possible to construct coders with binary devices because of the restrictions on the code. In this report, a Fibonacci coder with a binary feedback shift register is discussed and examined. With the proper applications of the Fibonacci coders, the implementation of the digital data transmission systems with Fibonacci Code becomes realizable."
"As a result of evaluations made in conjunction with the Antisubmarine Warfare Environmental Prediction System (ASWEPS) program in the early 1960's, it became clear that the shipboard environmentalist could not manually prepare the sophisticated acoustic ray diagrams and sonar range computations required for ASW present-day operations. The locally obtained bathythermographs and other oceanographic data were not used to their full potential because of these limitations. To test the effectiveness of at-sea numerical processing and display of oceanographic information an Automated Shipboard Forecasting System (ASFS) was developed in 1968 and placed on the USS WASP (CVS-18) for a two-year test. The unclassified results of the test will be discussed. A review of the computer programs written to convert real-time oceanographic data to sound velocity profiles, acoustic ray path diagrams, propagation loss curves, and other environmental products is included."
"Poor orientation on the ocean floor has always hampered divers in performing work. Generally because of poor visibility and lack of sufficient \"benchmarks\" on the ocean bottom, the task of leaving and returning to a specific area may be difficult or even impossible without navigational aids. Contemporary pinger-receiver systems do much to solve these problems; however, there are some serios drawbacks. First, these systems usually employ a set of underwater earphones which the diver wears to detect a beacon placed at some particular location. Secondly, because these systems require the diver to hear these signals, breathing and regulator noises have a tendency to make the signals hard to detect. The Naval Undersea Research and Development Center is developing a Diver Navigation System which employs an omnidirectional visual display. This system which uses phase detection techniques has been designed to eliminate the deficiencies mentioned above. Testing and evaluation will be continued in order to make the system easily usable by the diver without extensive training."
"The acoustic impedance and velocity of sound are increased considerably in the deep-submergence hyperbaric HeO gas mixture. This increases the spectrum bandwidth of speech and at the same time alters the frequency response of microphones designed for use on the surface. The mechanical elements of microphones are not affected by gas composition and pressure; however, the acoustical elements are affected non-proportionally. Thus, a microphone which is carefully tuned at one atmosphere in air may be considerably out of adjustment under hyperbaric conditions. The problem of finding a conventional microphone to meet specialized requirements can be alleviated by designing for hyperbaric conditions. Systems with a high mechanical impedance will not be affected by gas composition and pressure. Effective waterproofing is essential. For applications in masks, noise-cancelling microphones are very effective."
"This Center has set up a unique sonar range between the tops of two seamounts in the Pacific Ocean. The great distance from the end points to shore has precluded the routing of power and control cables to manned stations and has, consequently, given rise to some unusual instrumentation. The transmitting station was pre-programmed on implantment in June 1969 to broadcast a wide variety of frequencies and signal types during a 10-min period every four hours. The 2000-watt peak power demands are satisfied by a nickel-cadmium battery (subjected to 900 psi sea pressure) which, in turn, receives its charge from a 25-watt radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The station \"health\" is indicated by the battery voltage at the beginning and end of each transmitting period and is conveyed by a 400-nmi telemetry link, nearly half of which is under water. The receiving station employs a specially designed spar buoy whose three taut anchor lines and independently routed hydrophone cables were allowed to free fall to the ocean floor. Data are processed, and stored in this buoy and are telemetered, on command, once each day to shore for further processing."
"Development of a microminiature self-contained underwater binaural communications set for the military diver has been completed at the Naval Ship Research and Development Laboratory, Panama City, Florida (NAVSHIPRANDLAB, Panama City). The primary objectives were high intelligibility, reliability, and ease of operation. The equipment features voice operated transmission (to free the diver's hands), automatic gain control, binaural reception, and microminiature state-of-the-art electronic components. Results achieved include a range of 2000 yards, phonetically balanced (PB) word intelligibility of 90 percent, and a localization accuracy of approximately 10 degrees. This equipment is mounted entirely on the diver's head and, for the first time, provides the diver with truly unencumbered communications."
"A Tsunami detector is developed for a pressure signal which is measured digitally in a deep ocean capsule. Spurious data is rejected via first differencing and interpolation. Kalman filter theory is applied to the problem of the rejection of the colored noise of the tides. The detection thresholds are determined from a stochastic study of the background or sea noise from previous experiments."
"Extensive gravity anomaly coverage is required in formulating an accurate gravity perturbation vector. Stokes' and Meinesz's integral formulas are presently used in calculating the gravity vector. However, a two-dimensional Fourier series approach to data representation is presented which efficiently functionalizes the data so as to minimize the computational complexity involved in determining the gravity perturbation vector. Also discussed is the hypothesis of using a Satellite Field gravity model to reduce the raw gravity anomalies to a finer residual gravity anomaly field which has not been mathematically modeled."
"An iterative technique is developed which can be used to determine an approximation to a linear system from a finite number of samples of its impulse response. The approximation is derived on the basis of the least squared-error between the desired impulse response and the impulse response of a recursive filter model. The unique advantage of the technique is that the model response is constrained to be in\\ell_{2}space, by augmenting the given impulse response with a particular square summable sequence that not only guarantees stability, but enables the solution of a constrained minimization problem. An algorithm to mechanize the technique was programmed in FORTRAN, and used on stable and unstable system responses to illustrate the technique."
"Our goal is to extend the reach of man to the depths of the hostile ocean environment. Experience indicates that the best approach is the use of electro-hydraulic manipulators. For a decade NUC has been doing useful work in the sea with remotely controlled hydraulic devices. These devices have ranged from the early three-function \"claw\" of the Cable-controlled Undersea Research Vehicle, made famous by the recovery of an H-bomb off the coast of Spain, to the current seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator. This manipulator is spot mounted and rate controlled and has a parallel jaw hand. It possesses unique mechanical, electrical and hydraulic features to make it especially well adapted for ease of control and for operation in a high pressure corrosive medium. A new and highly sophisticated manipulator is now being manufactured for the Remote Unmanned Work System. Position control and force feedback will give the manipulator capabilities approaching the highly successful mechanical master-slave devices now used in hot cell work. This will be the first time the principals of electro-hydraulic feedback control will be fully applied to an undersea manipulator."
"Simulation of large-scale pollution problems is most often subject to identification of important physical constants. Moreover, the inherent randomness of the surroundings in which identification is to take place compounds the analytical difficulties. In some cases the analysis must consider the distributed parameter system. This paper presents results which advance ocean pollution identification techniques in two directions. First, a necessary and sufficient criterion for \"identifiability\" of a given parameter is developed. This result can be used to determine what kind of data is actually necessary, how many data-gathering sensors are required, and where these sensors should be placed. The second advance lies in the demonstration that a constrained maximum likelihood approach is asymptotically consistent, even in some cases where the likelihood function is not unimodal, and the observations are not independent. The results are applied to the problem of salt brine dispersion from desalination plant ocean outfalls."
"This paper provides a detailed look at the overall problem of ocean dumping and presents discussion on U. S. regulations, international efforts, and an approach to the problem of ocean dumping. A systematic approach, starting with identification of types of wastes, determination of environmental effects, and providing specifications for disposal is reviewed. Enactment of legislation, identification of regulatory authority, and the establishment of a workable enforcement system are also discussed."
"An underwater navigator system is proposed which will allow a precise measurement of acoustic phase shifts due to the medium stability of the surrounding ocean environment of any suitably instrumented undersea sonar range. The prime components of the system comprise a strapdown inertial measurement unit (SIMU), a shipborne general purpose computer, a sonar transmitter, a geometric array of bottom-mounted hydrophones and a link for sending sonar derived position fixes from a shore-based computer to the shipborne computer. A feasibility study is presented to show that a specified relative positional accuracy goal can be met taking into account the statistical nature of the sonar fix and of the inertial sensors."
 "A beam-coded track marker light that facilitates precise navigation along a straight line is described. The track marker light was developed by the Naval Ship Research and Development Laboratory, Panama City, Florida, and was sponsored by the Naval Ship Systems Command under Sub-project SF 0110235, Task 2517-2 and Task 2509-12. The light developed produces high intensity color coded beams side-by-side that are separated by a very narrow transition zone. The transition zone subtends an angle that approaches the system diffraction limit of 2.35 arc seconds. When the light is directed toward the horizon, the transition zone provides a vertical reference line for navigation that is visible with the unaided eye at 3 miles in daylight and is visible to the horizon at night. An iodine-quartz lamp serves as the light source and it may be either a-c or battery powered. The assembly consists of the lamp, collection and projection optics, filters, and the housing. The unit is lightweight, inexpensive, and is small enough for portable application."
"SWEPS is a new method of combining sea wave power and air driven turbines to generate electrical energy. The acronym SWEPS is an abbreviation for Sea Wave Electric Power System. This Arrangement involves a means of using sea wave power to compress air to high pressure and using that air to drive a high speed air operated turbogenerator. The idea, primarily conceived to furnish power for Sea Relay and Weather Towers, might be modified for use to generate power for commercial consumption by mounting the apparatus on a floating pier or buoy supported platform."
"The detectability of static electric and magnetic dipoles near the ocean bottom is examined. The search for these objects is assumed coherent and limited only by natural environmental noise. Short wavelength magnetic anomalies limit the range of the magnetic dipole source, while oceanic turbulence limits the range of the electric dipole. On a worldwide basis the maximum detectable range for a 10 watt torus is estimated to be 13-50 meters while the corresponding length for a 10 watt electric dipole is 90- 370 meters. Electrochemical effects at the receiving antenna will have to be minimized, however, to obtain the range advantage of the electric search."
"This paper discusses data processing methods on digitized marine seismic data supplied by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The histogram of the amplitude probability density function, correlation function and the fast Fourier transform study of the amplitude and power spectra of the data as well as the data combining methods are considered. For the WHOI data, the signal power from every seismic return at the output of a narrow digital low-pass filter (0-3 Hz) is determined. The signal power is also computed for every ten samples of the combined data. Based on these results, an interpretation of the geological structure of the ocean bottom is made."
"A telemetry system that can communicate with a deep ocean sediment probe in depths of up to 6,000 feet from a shipboard location is described. Data from the probe occupies a total bandwith of over 200 Khz so that transmission through the ocean is immediately ruled out. The transmission medium chosen is 10,000 feet of type 2P4ORC double armored coaxial cable that also acts as the load bearing number. The attenuation characteristics of this cable are plotted. It is apparent from this plot that a modulation technique that is independent of amplitude distortion should be used. An FM technique, which transmits 100 channels of data --2 of which have bandwidths of 100 Khz, is used to obtain distortionless information that is recorded aboard ship on magnetic tape. Commands are initiated at the shipboard Control Console as oscillator pairs. The two frequencies have tuned devices on the probe which decode the pair. Commands and data can be transmitted simultaneously."
"Summary form only given. The National Ocean Survey (NOS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is engaged in a long-term program to systematically map the geophysical characteristics of the continental margins of the United States and portions of the adjacent deep oceans. It is planned that two series of maps will be produced--one at a scale of 1:250,000 for the continental margin, *and another at a scale 1 :of1 ,000,000 for the deep oceans. Each map unit will contain bathymetry as a base map, with magnetic, gravimetric, and seismic properties as contoured overlays. Additionally, reports and other products will be produced. Control will be the best available. Coverage will be based upon a grid system - a scale of 1:250,000 for the continental margin, - and another at a scale of 1:1,000,000 for the deep oceans. The deep sea work is presently being undertaken as a part of the President's International Decade of Ocean Exploration (IDOE). The continental margins will be surivne ypeadr t by NOAA ships and possibly by private contractors. The data will be available to users through the Environmental Data Service of NOAA. We hope that future programs will allow regional map atlases to be developed, including sediment properties, heat flow data, basement structure, and various physical parameters."
"Double loop tracking devices have been employed in various applications, e.g., tracking submersibles randomly exploring the ocean floor perform ranging and synchronization in telemetry systems, etc. This paper serves to summarize a nonlinear theory which can be used to the access performance of double loop systems for which the Delay-Locked Loop is a special case. System performance statistics can be calculated thus illustrating the application and usefulness of the theory."
"The viewing range and resolution capabilities of underwater television systems are often limited due to absorption and scattering properties of sea water. An additional problem with present systems is the lack of display realism needed for close vehicle guidance and effective control of undersea teleoperator systems. This paper discusses various imaging techniques which can be used to improve underwater visibility, and describes tests which were conducted to compare the performance of several underwater television systems. Improvements in display realism through the use of head-coupled television and stereo television are discussed, and a remotely controlled observation vehicle is briefly described."
"A simulation model has been formulated for the parametric analysis of the capabilities of advanced underwater viewing systems and to facilitate the comparison of the different systems. The water medium is characterized in the model by the absorption coefficient,a, the scattering coefficient,s, the volume scattering function,\\sigma, and the polarization coefficient,\\psi_{p}, of the backscattered light. Monte Carlo techniques are used to calculate effective attenuation coefficients for illuminating, image-forming, and backscattered light. These coefficients permit the most significant effects of multiple scattering to be incorporated into the model. The output of the simulation is the expected signal and backscattered irradiance functions across a strip in the image plane of the receiver."
"Three basic approaches to acoustic imaging are described: focused imaging, which uses acoustic lenses or reflectors to form an image; holographic imaging, which reconstructs images from detected wavefronts; and high-resolution beamforming imaging, which maps the object plane into the image plane by scanning. For each system type, possible hardware implementations are described with specific examples of existing systems. In addition, problems associated with each technique are discussed."
"Summary form only given. The paper discusses the configuration of the acoustical and electronic components of the system and describes the various factors which influence the quality of the reconstructed images. A number of practical problems that would be encountered in adapting such a system to an ocean environment are considered. [No further information was available at time of publication.]"
"Pressure resistant hulls have been fabricated from acrylic plastic to give the crews of research submersibles underwater panoramic visibility. Two standard spherical hull designs are currently available; (a) 66 inch outside diameter and 2.5 inch thickness for 600 ft. operational depth and (b) 66 inch outside diameter and 4.0 inch thickness for 1000 ft. depth. The hulls are fabricated by adhesive bonding of 12 thermoformed spherical pentagons, two of which incorporate metallic hatches. These hulls have been incorporated in NEMO, JOHNSON-SEA-LINK, AND MAKAKAI submersibles. These pressure resistant hulls meet the certification requirements of the U. S. Navy as well as of the American Bureau of Shipping."
"In spite of technological advances in instrument design, data centers continue to encounter data management problems when processing, storing and retrieving marine data. This paper describes the Environmental Data Service's (EDS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U. S. Department of Commerce, concept of data management, the importance of utilizing what is already known about the environment in establishing instrument design criteria, explores the concept of using dedicated ancillary recorders, and describes the scope of services available to instrument designers from EDS data centers. Too often, instrument systems do not facilitate the integration of ancillary data-navigational information, quality control and/or calibration information with the observed data in order to provide the necessary documentation for secondary use. It shows further that instruments are frequently designed to operate over the broad ranges of environmental conditions rather than limited ranges which would give greater precision or reliability."
 "The Maritime Administration's Ships of Opportunity Program attempts to support the ocean science and technology research requirements of the maritime industry and of Federal agencies where such agencies are in need of more ships and technicians to fulfill their ocean science data collection missions. Two initial programs are discussed in this paper: (1) the MarAd/National Marine Fisheries Service Expendable Bathythermograph Program; and (2) the MarAd/Sea Use Council Program to develop North Pacific Wave Spectra, Rational Ship Structural Design Criteria and Utilization of the Cobb Seamount."
"An electronic subsystem was developed for on-line, real-time digital and graphical conversion of coordinates derived from a range-range mode electronic precision positioning and navigation system. The application of this development is well suited to high density tight-grid marine surveys, especially where accuracy and relocation of a few feet are required as in undersea mining and mineral deposit delineation. A substantial reduction in man-hours expended for data processing is realized with this capability, particularly in time expended pre-plotting grids prior to field work and data reduction and processing after completing the field work."
"This paper describes an instrument for recording depth of oceanographic and other underwater towed gear. A pressure-rated, streamlined housing contains the pressure sensing element and recording mechanism. The housing is rated for depths as deep as 1,000 feet and towing speeds as high as 40 knots. Basically, the depth sensing element works on the principle of displacing a precision-made, spring-loaded piston. The piston is displaced an amount proportional to the water pressure. A self-contained battery-powered drive mechanism makes a permanent record of the towing operation depth history. In this paper, specific details are given for the principle of operation, design of the streamlined housing, design for a specific depth range, drag predictions, expected error, calibration techniques, and maintenance procedures."
"This project is four years old. The scope of this grand concept was to project man's technical capability to the limits of the ocean volume, and beyond, in support of National security and non-defense goals. Four years in the rational, financial world of DOD has changed the scope of the technology demonstrations but not the quality of the advanced technology goals originally set. The current project is relevant and productive. Advanced technologies are developed and demonstrated for: Reliable wet electrical systems; titanium as a certified hull material; variable sea-water ballast system; specifications for glass buoyancy structures; advanced optical and acoustic imaging; remote work systems and sea-floor construction technologies and hardware. The advanced technology products are integrated into three focal projects: ALVIN DSV Modification for 12,000'; Remote Unmanned Work System for 20,000'; SEACON (Sea-floor Constructions) to 6,000'."
"This paper discusses the approach taken in collecting reliability and maintainability data during testing of two Assault Support Patrol Boats. The method used to collect the data and the types of data collected are discussed. A 5-month segment of data is used to illustrate the type of information collected during the test."
"The results of a laboratory investigation of the wave induced forces on a submerged cylinder are reported. Force and pressure distributions on a cylinder located on and near a wave basin floor are correlated with surface water waves of varying amplitude and period. The horizontal and vertical components of forces on the cylinder are registered by strain gage outputs and by measuring pressure distributions around the cylinder with pressure transducers. The results of this laboratory study are being used as the basis for planned in situ experiments with cylinders mounted on or near the ocean floor."
"Acoustic signals from Dungeness crabs of known size and sex have been collected and analyzed. The digital analysis included computation of the autocorrelation function and the power spectral density of each signal. The relationship between spectral resolution, statistical error and signal length was considered. Several different spectral windows were applied. The width of the window was found to have a greater effect on the spectrum than did the type of window. Results of the analysis to date indicate that it may be possible to identify the sex of a crab from its acoustic signature. Effective and practical methods of recovering and analyzing the acoustic signatures of marine species could lead to a remote detection and identification technique. Success with such a technique should contribute to both more efficient harvesting and more effective management of marine resources."
 "Can off-the-shelf electronic components be used in the deep ocean without protection from the very high hydrostatic pressure? This paper describes a test philosophy and a unique facility designed to answer this question and to determine the mechanisms of failure that are encountered under severe pressure. The facility consists of three pressure vessels, each having 150 electrical penetrators and a working pressure of 30,000 psi. Vessel temperature is controllable from0\\degC to40\\degC . The present semiautomatic pressure and temperature control is discussed along with a description of the designed-in capability for complete computer-controlled tests. The test philosophy includes the rationale for why the components are energized, what components are currently being tested, what components can be tested, and why failure analysis is performed. The data acquisition and reduction system is described as it currently exists and as it will exist when modified into a computer-controlled, real-time data system."
"The Naval Torpedo Station collaborated with the University of Washington, Department of Oceanography, to develop a calibration technique for inductive conductivity probes. The basically simple technique uses an empirical relationship between salinity, temperature and conductivity developed at the University. Development of the salinity-conductivity-temperature relationship is presented. Confinement of the external electrical field in a finite tank affects calibration as do discontinuities in the medium, such as a protective cage. Accuracy of calibration is assessed."
"A gas generating (latent) buoyancy system or a fixed system comprised of solid buoyant elements can be employed in the recovery of instrument packages from great depths. The difference in characteristics of the two classes of recovery devices is discussed. The latent system offers better performance and fewer handling problems but at a higher purchase cost. It is consequently favored for emergency buoyancy and other special uses, whereas the fixed buoyancy system is employed more in conventional practice."
"In recent years a large number of towed bodies for military and commerieal ocean engineering purposes have been put into service. A general trend in this activity is that towed bodies are getting larger, towing speed is getting faster and the operating depth of towed bodies is getting deeper. Towing vehicle, tow line and towed body are not only subjected to ocean wave, wind and current but also subjected to vibration excitation force due to flow around tow line and machinery of towing vehicle. In this paper the equilibrium attitude and altitude of towed body, and equilibrium configuration of cable when towing vehicle is advancing at constant speed is discussed. In addition, the dynamic characteristics of tow line due to tow point motion excitation is discussed. Finally, the considerations required to select a right tow line for the towing applications are listed."
"Careful control of the environment in a hyperbaric facility is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the occupants. In this paper total environmental control in the hyperbaric chamber is broken down into eight categories of control: total pressure, O2partial pressure, CO2partial pressure, temperature and humidity, trace contaminants, fire detection, bacteria and noise. For each category an assessment is given of the difficulty and degree of control required and its importance to the occupants' well-being. For a diver in the water the special problems encountered in O2partial pressure control, CO2partial pressure control, and temperature control are also discussed briefly, each in its respective category. For each category the state of the art is discussed and the requisites for technological advancement are identified."
 "Project Deep View is the first submersible to incorporate glass for a significant portion of the pressure hull. It represents the first full-size manned experiment with high strength to weight transparent hulls. In a brief few years of submersible operations pilots and observers have learned the limitations of view port vision and a few have observed the maximum effectiveness obtained through transparent hulls (Sea-Link, Nemo, Kumukahi). As time continues and experience builds the glass and glass-ceramic transparent hulls continue to appear as the next step for going deeper. The difficulties in using presently available glass are due to the present low quality, brittleness and the physical properties mismatch with other high strength materials. Techniques for quantitative stress analysis were developed and comparative experiments with numerous glass to metal joints were conducted until the final design was obtained. The various subsystems are briefly described as well as the sequential testing of the pressure hull, environmental propulsion, etc. and test operations to date."
"As part of the International Field Year Great Lakes (IFYGL), a data collection system consisting of a network of 21 hydrological and meteorologicalmeasurement stations for both offshore and land installation at Lake Ontario has been developed for the U. S. Lake Survey. Five interrogation stations monitor the measurement stations by VHF telemetry or hardwire connection as required. A control center in Rochester accepts the data from the interrogation stations via phone line every six minutes. There the data is combined, recorded and sent via phone line to the project's computer center in Detroit. The system will be used by the U. S. Lake Survey to acquire pertinent data throughout 1972. At the same time, the Canadian government will acquire similar data from the opposite side of the lake."
"Consider the design of a point detector array to extract a signal from background noise, using the criterion of maximizing the SNR. For certain array configurations, although we can theoretically find a particular set of excitations that result in a very high SNR, the SNR may be extremely sensitive to small random variations in the excitations about their nominal values. The super-gain ratio (or Q-factor) is a measure of this sensitivity. A recent formulation for the optimization of the SNR with a constraint on the Q-factor, reduces the problem to one of solving for the roots of a polynomial whose coefficients are, in general, complex. However, only real polynomials were considered, probably because of the excessive computation time involved. This paper (1) considers what happens when the coefficients are complex, and more importantly (2) demonstrates that by making a certain transformation it becomes possible to employ a state variable technique which changes the numerical problem into one of finding the eigenvalues of a real matrix which is considerably faster to do."
"Floating ocean platforms have many potential applications. Concrete construction has definite cost advantages over steel construction. Modular designs lead to feasible construction techniques. This paper discusses the design and motion of platforms designed with these observations as guides."
"Acoustical profiling of the sea floor and the first 200 feet of the subbottom can provide the soils and foundation design engineer with a more complete picture of the geological conditions that he has to take into consideration than any other present means of investigation. The acoustical reflection profiles can be supplemented by core data and seismic refraction programs to give an even more complete engineering assessment. Examples of acoustic profiles will be shown and discussed and several brief case histories will be described. The various acoustic systems and their applications will be evaluated."
"Evaluation of the diffusion characteristics of an estuary requires an understanding of the turbulence structure and a measure of the range and variability of the eddy diffusion coefficients. Such data are of primary importance to investigators seeking to estimate possible environmental changes through predictive numerical or hydraulic models. This paper presents a review of the turbulence problem with particular emphasis on estuaries. Both spectral characteristics and spatial scales are considered and related to experimental procedures. Currently available instrumentation is reviewed and its performance critiqued. Emphasis is placed on long-term reliability. Both Lagrangian and Eulerian methods are discussed."
"Near and offshore installations now require environmental statements before construction. Design, therefore, must involve ecological strategy, with an interdisciplinary approach to engineering problems. Physical properties of materials are no longer a prime responsibility in planning and constructing marine structures. Thought must be given as to the effects that materials have on life and habitat. Only through baseline studies, past and present, with predictive systems approach to ecology can realistic appraisals be given to the effects that structural, electrical, and chemical components of marine structures have on their surroundings. Components affecting marine life and their habitats are: stray voltages, slag from welding, chemical waste treatment facilities, corrosion-prone materials (especially those susceptible to bacterial actions and resultant gases), and any components which increase turbidity, either through particulate matter or increased surface biological productivity."
"Long time series of temperature data for air, water and bottom sediment were obtained with a vertical thermistor array in a fixed location in shallow coastal water off southern California. Statistical techniques are employed to determine the amplitude and phase of the thermal waves from the air-sea interface through the water column and into the sediment layer. The long period thermal waves are dominated, nominally, by annual, semi-annual and monthly periodicities. Results obtained using the classical solution with constant conductivity agree well with the experimental data for the annual thermal wave but for the semi-annual and monthly waves the agreement, in the water column, is poor. Theoretical results obtained using an eddy heat conductivity that varied exponentially with depth agree well with experimental results for the annual, semi-annual and monthly thermal waves."
"The TRW SEA Divers Club has been involved for more than two years in an ambitious project to restore the giant kelp to Pt. Vicente Cove on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. A kelp habitat is being constructed which will provide protection to transplanted kelp plants. The kelp plants, with this protection, would then comprise a \"fertility center'' for spore production. These spores would settle on the surrounding rocks and proliferate the kelp thus accomplishing our objective. The project can be divided into three phases. The first phase is the habitat construction and kelp emplacement. The second phase is concurrent with the first and third phases and consists of marine fauna behavior studies, primarily on sea urchins. The third phase will consist of activities designed to ensure the survival of the sporophytes developing on the surrounding rocks. The project status and future plans will be described emphasizing the accomplishments of volunteer divers on an essentially unfunded program."
"Ray optics theory is applied to a particular case of oil polluted layer, caused by some underwater source. Two-layered ocean model is considered; layer one is of saline water of the ocean and layer two, oil polluted saline water. Both of these layers are assumed to be linearly inhomogeneous. Ray paths are traced in the above said type of medium and the associated errors present are calculated. Computer calculated results are plotted showing ray paths for various initial angles of incidence of 10, 20, 40, and 60 degrees respectively."
"Conventional electrical hull penetrators for deep-submersible applications employing pressure-resistant construction become prohibitively heavy when designed for reliable operation at 20,000 ft depth. Outboard cable assemblies employing conventional helical-lay conductors with a heavy rubber jacket and attached to the back shell of pressure-proof electrical connectors by rubber-molding or similar techniques have been shown to be extremely short-lived and very unreliable when subjected to a relatively small number of typical pressure cycles. A solution to both of these problems has been found in utilization of oil-filled pressure-compensation construction. While the weight saving for the cable assemblies is not so spectacular, the tremendous improvement in reliability along with substantial increase in versatility and ease of manufacture and installation makes the new approach attractive to designers of deep-submergence vehicles. The units described in this paper were developed for use on the Westinghouse Deep Star 20,000 vehicle. The electrical hull penetrators can each accommodate up to 11 external cables each containing 9 #16 AWG conductors. Extensive environmental testing has been accomplished and is described."
"The feasibility of employing a model reference controller synthesis technique to design a control system for a deen submergence vehicle (DSV) is investigated. The synthesis technique is based on Liapunov's direct method and may be applied to nonlinear, time-varying, multivariable systems. The control system is based on a nonlinear control law. It forces the vehicle to behave like a linear time-invariant reference model. For motion in a plane, six model state variables are defined as the vehicle's desired position coordinates and velocity components. An error vector is defined with components equal to the difference between these desired states and the vehicle's actual position coordinates and velocity components. The control system causes the error vector to approach zero. Two types of control action are discussed: maneuvering from one specified position to another, and maintaining a fixed position under the influence of random currents. The two situations are simulated on a digital computer. Simulation results show that the vehicle behaves as desired in both cases."
"Energy arriving at a receiving site, from multiple elevation angles at a single azimuth, places constraints on array design which are nearly independent of other phenomena. Methods are developed to determine the constraints and to produce approximate design equations and curves for collinear and planar arrays. The approximate methods are compared to exact calculations for a few exemplary cases to establish the validity of the approximations. Curves and equations for the collinear array give the maximum attainable gain for a given arrival geometry and the length and number of hydrophones required to achieve a specified gain. For planar arrays, equations are presented which allow calculation of required dimensions and number of hydrophones. Although the design equations do not give details of hydrophone placement, or account for other propagation phenomena, they provide useful preliminary estimates as a basis for more detailed design."

"Resolution of echo sounders and sub-bottom profilers is limited by the beamwidth of the system. Beamwidths of2\\degor so are desired, but at the low operating frequencies required by attenuation of the signals the apertures become very large. A method based on the inherent nonlinearity of the acoustic medium at high intensities (the finite amplitude effect) has been developed which permits an order of magnitude reduction in aperture dimensions. An experimental finite amplitude system with a2\\degbeamwidth at an operating frequency of 12 KHz is described, and at-sea test results presented."
 "A problem of concern to ships operating with one another is the gridlock, or relative navigation, problem. The method developed here uses a linear combination of mutually exchanged observations of relative position to form new and better estimates of these positions. Chief advantage of the method is the reduction of gridlock errors it provides. The primary disadvantage is that it is limited by the range of the local sensors on board each ship."
"In this paper, it is treated that the features of formation and transport and physical properties of the curious extraordinary stable sea foam produced along the Japan seashore during prevailing seasonal wind. Such phenomena often occured at the Pacific coastal lines of Japan on the season of the typhoon and high winds. Then the Fukura shore, Yamagata Pref., is selected as the representative station for observations. Moreover, the above analysis is performed by making use of the Foaming Factor, a certain physical quantity, which has been previously introduced by one of the authors (Abe) in order to evaluate the degree of a production of whitecap on a crest of wave and then has been used in a watermass analysis in a slick area with fairly good sucsess. It is attributed to stabilization of sea foam due to surface active substances extracted from coastal phytoplankton (mainly a certain type of diatom), sea weed, etc. when the water is disturbed violently by wind and wave action."
"A digital system is proposed which detects moving targets and suppresses the reflections of stationary targets in a pulse radar. The system uses the quantized coherent video for the spectral discrimination of Doppler shifted signals. The main part is a recursive-type digital filter. Quadrature channels are used in order to improve the detectability of signals. The part which follows it is an integrator and a threshold for automatic detection. After some considerations concerning the realization, some results of a simulation of the system are discussed."
"An exploratory study has been conducted to determine the feasibility of obtaining and using in-flight manikin recordings to evaluate flight helmets with respect to speech intelligibility. Intelligibility test materials were transmitted to six airborne subjects and a manikin as each was fitted with different flight helmets. Similar test materials were presented to the same six subjects in a simulated flight situation. Recordings obtained via the airborne manikin were subsequently played back in the laboratory to the six subjects and two groups of ten listeners each. Comparison of listener scores obtained in the three test situations revealed that scores obtained for the manikin recordings approximated those obtained during the in-flight tests; relative differences among three helmets for the two test situations were very similar. Standard deviations calculated from listener scores obtained for the three test situations revealed less variance for the manikin recordings. The results of the study demonstrate that a manikin head, used in conjunction with a portable tape recorder, can be flown in various types of aircraft to obtain valuable information regarding the communication effectiveness of flight helmets."
"A digital frequency synthesizer has been designed and constructed based on generating digital samples of\\exp [j(2^{\\pi}nk/N)]at timenT. The real and imaginary parts of this exponential form samples of quadrature sinusoids where the frequency indexkis allowed to vary(-N/4) \\leq K < (N/4). The digital samples drive digital to analog converters followed by low-pass interpolating filters to produce analog sinusoids. The method is superior to digital difference equations with poles on the unit circle since the noise or numerical inaccuracy remains bounded. The digital technique used consists of factoring the exponential into two table look-ups from an efficiently organized small READ-ONLY memory table and performing a complex multiply to produce the real and imaginary components. A small array multiplier efficiently organized performs the multiplications. The technique lends itself to the production of phase coherent or phase controlled sinusoids because of the indexing arrangement used. In addition finer frequency steps than the READ-ONLY memory allows are available by expanding the indexing register at no increase in inaccuracy."
"Complex BIFORE transform (CBT) is extended to multiple dimensions. Basic properties of multidimensional CBT are developed and a fast algorithm for its computation is applied."
"Semiconductor and solid-state devices have been used extensively to measure and generate stresses and stress waves in solids, liquids, and gases. Semiconductor devices have been used as strain gauges to measure strains and to respond to acoustic pressures, p-type silicon has a gauge factor of over 100 times that of a metallic strain gauge. By using the amplifying regimes of Esaki diodes and transistors, a great increase in sensitivity is obtained and microphones have been constructed that are more sensitive than the carbon microphone. With the advent of monolithic transistor on single chips and films, it appears likely that the most stable and economical devices are obtained by separating the pickup and amplifying functions. p-n junctions have a region (the depletion region) where electrons are excluded and if the semiconductor is piezoelectric, very high-frequency transducers for generating mechanical waves in solids can be produced. Evaporation techniques can also be used to produce frequencies from lower ranges to very high-frequency ranges. With the advent of more highly coupled piezoelectric crystals and ceramics, this technique may be extended further. Solid-state transducers have also been constructed using the Hall effect and the magnetoresistance effect. These have been applied in measuring static and dynamic fluxes, as variable resistors without sliding contacts and as displacement meters and microphones."
"Some details are given of a channel vocoder intended for use as a speech output device for data-processing systems, but also suitable for voice transmission with 2400 bit/s, e.g., in narrow-band digital radio systems or in digital encryption systems. Characteristic features are, in the analyzer, the use of switched op-amp integrators instead of conventional low-pass filters plus rectifiers, and digital amplitude compression; in the synthesizer, pulse excitation which, in the case of unvoiced sounds, is achieved by means of a pseudorandom pulse derived from a digital shift-register circuit. This pseudorandom pulse exhibits very good stability and reproducibility."
"Directional electroacoustic transducers for the audio-frequency range, based on the electrostatic principle using foil electrets, have been designed. The directivity is achieved by utilizing first, second, and higher order gradients with bidirectional, unidirectional, and toroidal characteristics. Experimental results on directional characteristics directivity factor, and frequency response for each type of transducer are described. Possible application of such directional microphones in two-way communication systems is also discussed."
"Techniques for determining the coefficients of digital filters which have equiripple or minimax errors are reviewed and occasionally extended. These techniques include: 1) mapping to provide equiripple errors in recursive filters; 2) windows for making Fourier spectrum measurements with minimax leakage; 3) the simplex method of linear programming to provide minimax errors in a nonrecursive filter's time response to a known pulse or Fourier transform of its coefficients; 4) nonlinear programming to provide minimax errors for nominally any response and filter; and 5) an integer programming technique to provide minimax error despite quantizing the coefficients of a nonrecursive filter. Some sources of computer programs embodying these techniques are indicated."
"Errors in power spectral density estimates are analyzed for a problem in which the estimator processes nonuniformly spaced data samples as if they were uniformly spaced (e.g., via fast Fourier transform). The sample position errors, or jitter, are thought to be the result of fluctuations in the spacings between the sampling positions. One application of this model is to samples taken from a magnetic tape whose speed is fluctuating randomly. When the spacing errors are uncorrelated, the position errors are shown to be approximately wide-sense stationary, with an autocorrelation function that depends on the length of the line (number of data samples). This approximation is more valid if the number of samples is increased. Closed form bounds are given for the resulting frequency-dependent spectral density error when the true spectral density is bounded by a simple analytical function. Computational examples also show the effects of sample length and true spectral density bandwidth on this spectral error. The main effect of the spacing errors is a slower high-frequency fall off in the apparent spectral density. These results suggest criteria for judging if nonuniformities in spacing will cause significant errors in spectral density estimates. If so, these errors can be reduced, for estimates at higher frequencies, by cutting a long data sample into shorter pieces and averaging the corresponding spectral estimates."
"Experiments investigating adaptive pattern recognition in automatic speaker verification are reported. A binary decision confirming or rejecting a speaker's purported identity is required. The experiments involve 7000 phrase length utterances of 118 speakers. An average misclassification rate of one percent with a \"no decision\" rate of ten percent is obtained. Other experiments indicate that the utterances used for training purposes should preferably be collected over a relatively long period of time."
"Although flexurally responsive piezoelectric elements have been utilized for a few decades, interest in their utility remains high. This is a result of the ability of such structures to generate high output from sources of low mechanical impedance, or conversely, to develop large displacement at low levels of electrical excitation. Typically, a bending response is obtained from a sandwich-like structure of two properly oriented piezoelectric expander plates in which case the unit is referred to as a bender Bimorph®. However, other approaches to benders include the unimorph, the Multimorph®, and other specially treated single-plate elements. Numerous applications utilizing bender responsive elements exist. To aid in meeting the variety of requirements presented by these applications, the supplier has available to him many options. These variables include choice of materials, geometry, and electrode configuration. In terms of volume of usage, the phonograph cartridge remains the number one application. However, many other electroacoustical devices are made possible by the availability of the Bimorph or its modified alternates. Some of these are indicated. In addition, the utility of the equivalent circuit and its constants are described."
"Maximally flat (MF) low-pass filters with multiple pairs of coincident or distinct imaginary axis zeros are investigated and compared with the all pole Butterworth filters. It is shown that for the same ordern, finite zero filters provide much sharper cutoff than Butterworth filters, and that the cutoff slope increases with increasing number of zeros. Expressions for cutoff slope and minimum attenuation in the stopband are derived in terms ofn, the number of pairs of zeros (m) and their locations. In the case of coincident multiple zeros, the stopband performance is found to be an optimum for a particular value ofm. The information required for design of finite zero filters is provided in the form of universal graphs and use of these graphs is illustrated by a design example."
"Tables are given for the roots of the normalized low-pass Bessel and Butterworth transfer functions in both Cartesian and polar form. The latter form is especially useful when designing transitional (Butterworth-Thomson) functions. The tables cover the orders 1 through 30 inclusive. In addition, the group delay characteristics for each of the above orders are tabulated for both the Bessel and Butterworth functions."
"A program to generate and display spectrograms on a computer-controlled scanned-display television monitor is described. The program features computation of power spectra for selected time segments with the aid of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, four-level intensity quantization controlled by a threshold under operator control, and flicker-free scanned display of the generated data. The computer-generated spectrograms suffer from intensity and spatial resolution limitations relative to conventional spectrograms. However, their rapid generation and flicker-free display makes their use appropriate in a man-computer interactive environment to complement aural evaluation of digitally synthesized or processed speech signals."
"Harmonically related peaks in the spectrum of a stationary stochastic process may indicate the presence or wave components that are not sine-shaped, i.e., whose Fourier expansions contain phase-locked higher order terms. But the spectrum itself suppresses phase relations, and more refined methods are needed to decide such questions. Moreover, phase relations might also exist outside of the peaks. We discuss proposals for testing the presence of phase relations and for extracting them quantitatively by means of numerical bispectrum analysis, and we derive their statistical properties and compare their relative merits. Applications of these methods to EEG signals will be presented."
"The transform of a spline-function approximation to continuous data is called a spline transform. In this correspondence, the spline and the discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) are compared as means for numerical computation of the Fourier integral transform. It is shown how the spline transform reduces errors introduced by the discrete transform and alleviates noise problems when the sampling rate is limited due to experimental method or hardware constraints."

"Successful application of electrets as telephone transmitter and less successful application as receivers are discussed. Amplifier gain and maximum input noise are derived from electret performance and system requirements. Simple corona charging is sufficient to produce stable fluorocarbon electrets with a useful life from 10 to 20 years. Two design approaches to compensate slackening of the electret diaphragm due to creep are described."
"Exact expressions for the sine and tangent forms of the second-order digital Butterworth bandpass filters are given. Here \"exact\" means that the placement of the half-power points is precise. These results are then used to generate exact forms of the band reject filters."
"This paper discusses the rms error in estimating the bearing of a source with a linear array in a noisy environment. The techniques used are the Cramér-Rao (CR) bound and techniques developed recently by Ziv and Zakai. These new techniques give improved results at low signal-to-noise ratio. Below a certain threshold level of signal-to-noise ratio, the error increases faster than the CR bound predicts. This error is shown to be related to the sidelobe structure of the array. The variation of bearing error with array design is considered."
"A series of underwater acoustic experiments has been performed to measure the effects of fading and partial coherence upon array performance after long-range transmission through the ocean. Measurements were made of the complex demodulates of signals that were generated by a bottom-fixed source off Eleuthera operating at 367 Hz and received by the hydrophones of a bottom-fixed array in the Bermuda area about 700 nmi away. The fading spectra of the signals showed a strong modulation at the ocean wave frequency of 0.08 Hz that is a distinctive characteristic of surface scattering. Slower variations were observed in the data that are probably due to changes in the scattering by the inhomogeneities of the sound velocity structure of the ocean caused by temperature change. The scattering strongly affected the coherence properties of the multipath signal and there was a severe degradation in the signal gain of the array that was obtained with plane-wave steering. The degradation was due to both the distortion of the average signal wavefront from planarity and the reduced level of coherence over the aperture of the array. The severity of these two effects was found to increase for averaging times sufficiently long to include the slower changes that were found in the scattering."
"The essential components of a system for ocean floor search are: facilities for safe deployment and retrieval of the search vehicle; a method for accurately determining the position of the ship and the search vehicle at all × suitable sensors and displays; provisions for rapid analysis of data; and facilities and personnel for proper operation and maintenance of the equipment. The unmanned towed vehicle system installed on Mizar (T-AGOR-11) uses a center well through which the sensor vehicle can be safely launched even in high sea states. The area about the Well is enclosed to provide a dry comfortable environment for maintenance and repair personnel. The hull-mounted acoustic tracking system provides means for accurate navigation using a single bottom reference transponder. Photographic, magnetic, and acoustic sensors are used simultaneously and excellent provisions are available for film development and data reduction. The major system design philosophy holds that all sensors must operate simultaneously, and all \"data\" are to be recorded in a permanent form. This latter requirement is very important since it reduces the dependency on \"alert\" operator performance and also permits reevaluation of data as the search progresses."
"The two major operational problems in deep ocean search are: 1) providing an adequate underwater navigational system in the area of interest and 2) minimizing search time, since time and cost are intimately related. The first problem is considered in hand due to pioneering work by Spiess (long base system) and Buchanan (short base system) as well as others. The second problem is discussed in terms of minimizing the search area A and maximizing the sensor sweep width W. Conceptual rather than detailed solutions are presented. In particular, the need for the establishment of a target location distribution on the search area and the requirement for the use of a priori knowledge when searching with nonvisual sensors are discussed."
"Some basic relationships are presented among the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), the Bryn statistic, and the simple additive beamformer output when detecting a stationary Gaussian plane wave in stationary Gaussian noise using an array of sensors. The noise at different sensors may be correlated. A long processing time is assumed. If two of the above detector outputs, when plotted versus steering, are merely scaled ands vertically offset versions of one another, the detectors will be said to be similar. With minor qualifications, necessary and sufficient conditions for the beamformer to be similar to the log-likelihood ratio detector at a given frequency are that the array gain (signal-to-noise ratio gain) versus steering be constant and be the same for both. It is also determined that the Bryn statistic is similar to the LLR whenever the beamformer is similar, but that it is not similar in some other instances such as near endfire or an interference."

"Pulse position modulation (PPM) is a simple and effective technique for transmitting information via the underwater acoustic channel. In this paper engineering design considerations for an underwater acoustic PPM system, including the location of threshold and the effects of multipath, attenuation, and time dispersion, are discussed. Techniques for calculating the required transmitter power, pulse repetition rate, and pulse width to communicate over some specified geometry are given."
"The application of narrow-band sampling theory and a system engineering approach to the design of a powerful but economical data acquisition and processing system is described. A commercially available recorder and filter bank are combined in an acquisition system which produces digital tape for later analysis. The program libraries normally associated with general-purpose computers provide the core of a system of processing programs compatible with the recorded tape. Important system parameters are given and illustrations of the use of the system are provided."
"A series of sea trials to evaluate the effects of the ocean medium on large time-bandwidth product pulses were recently completed. The pulses were retransmitted from an echo repeater and the echo was correlated in a correlator, the output being processed in a digital computer. This paper will be focused on the on-line and off-line processing software."
 "The active feedback block considered in this correspondence consists of three identical single-pole amplifiers and a resistive network, and has a positive slope in the gain frequency characteristics over a certain frequency range starting from dc. When the device is cascaded to another single-pole amplifier, the bandwidth and the gain-bandwidth product of the overall system are found to be increased compared to those of a cascaded two-stage amplifier."

"Application of a type of predictive coding to the channel signals of a homomorphic vocoder has produced sizable bit rate reductions. With only slight degradation in speech quality, reduction (for the spectral envelope information) from 7800 to 4000 bits/s was achieved. A technique for obtaining the formant frequencies from the predictive coding parameters is described; this approach promises further bit rate reductions. As a by-product of this study of predictive coding, direct and cascade form speech synthesizers are compared on the basis of differing quantization effects."
"A statistical model for product quantization where the error made by rounding a product is considered a discrete random variable is presented. The mean square of the error in the output due to product quantization is found. The model considers the effects of using different quantization levels for the input, coefficients, and products. A comparison to the results obtained using the usual continuous random variable model is made."
 "A great deal of work has been done recently on techniques for optimally designing finite duration impulse response (FIR) filters. One of these techniques, called frequency sampling, is a method for designing a digital filter from a set of samples of the desired filter frequency response. In this paper we present a unified discussion of the various types of frequency sampling designs and show how to realize them, both recursively and nonrecursively."
"In this paper, the space of square summable real sequences is considered. Insight is developed into the structure of the space and a method for representation of its elements is described. The method is shown suitable for on-line implementation and is noniterative; it can be used for wave-form design, signal feature extraction, and discrete-time system identification. The applications are exemplified by three simulation studies."
"A comprehensive circuit model is derived for the electromechanical transducer using an electromagnetic gyrator to link the electric and the magnetic circuits and a magnetomechanical gyrator to link the magnetic and the mechanical circuits. The unified model permits evaluation of the effect of the system parameters on overall operation, particularly the parameters of the magnetic circuit. The loudspeaker is discussed as a particular example although the theory can he extended to other electromechanical devices."
"Starting from an IEEE Recommended Practice for Speech Quality Measurements and from previous work of the authors, a large set of vocoded speech signals has been evaluated in terms of preference. The set of speech samples has been taken from the vocoder survey of the 1967 Conference on Speech Communication and Processing, Boston, Mass. The test samples are evaluated by several methods: direct comparisons, the isopreferenee method, the relative preference method, the category judgment method, and the absolute preference judgment method. Due to the size of the test material, not all the test samples could be evaluated by all these methods. The test results are discussed and it is shown that, in certain respects, reliable system evaluations pose formidable problems. An effort to rank order the systems, which are described by small sets of test samples of frequently very different quality, for good reasons shows only limited success. The majority of the systems are of about equal preference with only insignificant differences. There are only a few systems that are outside this group and are either significantly better or worse than the rest."
"Existing mathematical relations between the power spectral density and the mean zero-crossing rate of an ergodic random process are used to derive relations between spectral measurements and mean zero-crossing rates of a speech signal and its derivatives. Of particular significance is the equation relating zero-crossing rates to the formant parameters of vowels and vowel-like sounds. Reasonably close agreement between measured zero-crossing rates and those calculated from spectral measurements were observed for virtually all phonemes in a variety of contextual environments. Measured zero-crossing rates and corresponding calculated values for speech and its first derivative are presented for vowels, unvoiced fricatives, and unvoiced stops, all in many different contextual environments. Unvoiced fricatives /s/, /\\int/, and /f/ are shown to be distinguishable from each other solely on the basis of the zero-crossing rate of the derivative signal. Some vowels are shown to be differentiable from other vowels, although measurements other than zero-crossing rates of filtered, unfiltered, and differentiated speech are shown to be necessary for complete vowel separation. For unvoiced stop consonants, the zero-crossing rate of either the signal or its derivative is shown to be useful for classification, provided some information concerning the contextual environment is available."

"BIFORE or Hadamard transform is defined and several of its properties are developed. BIFORE power and phase spectra are developed and their frequency-sequency composition is explored. Using matrix partitioning, fast algorithms for efficient computation of BIFORE coefficients and power and phase spectra are developed. Multidimensional BIFORE transform is defined and a physical interpretation of its power spectrum is presented. Advantages and as well the limitations of the BIFORE transform in its application in information processing are cited."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"A method is presented that uses the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compute the output of an infinite-impulse-response digital filter. This method uses the summability of infinite-length geometric sequences to account for the aliasing that is inherent in using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to calculate convolutions. Previous procedures that use the FFT to realize recursive digital filters require that the filter have a large number of poles and zeros before the FFT method offers a computational advantage over the direct implementation of the filter. The technique presented here is competitive with direct filter implementation."
"A technique which decomposes an N-periodic sequence into2 \\log_{2} Nmutually orthogonal subsequences is developed. It is shown that these subsequences represent the power spectrum of the complex BIFORE transform."
"A design rule for digital filters minimizing their deadbands is derived here by observing and comparing the widths, and thus the severity of the effect, of deadbands that occur in different realizations of the same filter. It is asserted that, normally, the parallel realization is better than the direct realization. The caseade realization is comparable to the parallel realization, and would be better or worse depending on how the sections are cascaded."
"A lime-varying power spectrum is developed for the BIFORE or Hadamard transform (BT or HT) [1], [2]. This spectrum can be used for the purposes of on-line power spectral analysis in several areas where BT has already found applications [3]-[7]."
"This paper describes the theory and practical aspects of an audio power amplifier capable of delivering 50-W continuous into a 6-10-Ω load. The design utilizes a monolithic operational amplifier and incorporates a novel output driver circuit. Design objectives include low cost, unconditional thermal stability, and the use of standard-tolerance unmatched components. The output stage efficiency analysis assumes an unregulated power supply."
"The low-frequency performance of direct-radiator loudspeaker systems can be accarately specified and is quantitatively related to the basic parameters of the system components. These systems function at low frequencies as low-efficiency electroacoustic high-pass filters; the frequency-dependent behavior is described by rational polynomial functions whose coefficients contain basic component parameters. These basic parameters, which are simple to evaluate, determine the system low-frequency response, efficiency, and power ratings."
"A description is given of an unusual pattern recognition technique which has been used in an experimental speech recognition system. Preliminary results obtained using this technique are reported. The speech analyzer produces a multichannel ternary signal at its output, which is the short term digital autocorrelation function of the input signal. This output is sampled at regular intervals and this sampled information is transferred to a computer. A new pattern recognition technique is proposed that avoids the exhaustive comparison process associated with pattern matching. The technique is similar to a tree-structured process in that decisions are taken that exclude certain master patterns from further processing as it becomes apparent that these are sufficiently dissimilar to the unknown pattern. However, retracing within the structure and the substitution of an alternative path are permitted if the current path appears unlikely to lead to a correct decision. Some preliminary results obtained using this technique are described. These show that a performance very similar to that obtained from the exhaustive comparison process is attainable with a significant saving in computational effort. The effect of varying certain parameters within the recognition process is also considered and some preliminary optimization of parameter values is reported."
"In this paper we prove the discrete convolution theorem by means of matrix theory. The proof makes use of the diagonalization of a circulant matrix to show that a circular convolution is diagonalized by the discrete Fourier transform. The diagonalization of the circular convolution shows that the eigenvalues of a circular convolution operator are identical with the discrete Fourier frequency spectrum."
"Continuous signals are commonly reconstructed from the outputs of digital filters by means of a zero-order hold, which distorts the overall amplitade-frequency characteristic. Improved digital methods of correcting this distortion are given."
"The discrete-time counterparts of the Hermite family of orthogonal functions are mentioned briefly in Milne's book [1]. We have investigated the time and frequency-domain properties of these sequences which we call the binomial sequences. It is shown here that these sequences, or digital filters based on them, can be generated using adders and delay elements only. No coefficient multipliers need be used, so that there is no attendant accuracy problem. Furthermore, the absence of multipliers permits substantial savings in the cost and complexity of these filters and a corresponding improvement in reliability. The frequency-domain behavior of these nonrecursive binomial filters suggests a number of applications as low-pass Gaussian filters or as inexpensive bandpass filters."
"There are basically four modifications of the N=2Mpoint FFT algorithm developed by Cooley and Tukey which give improved computational efficiency. One of these, FFT pruning, is quite useful for applications such as interpolation (in both the time and frequency domain), and least-squares approximation with trignometric polynomials. It is shown that for situations in which the relative number of zero-valued samples is quite large, significant time-saving can be obtained by pruning the FFT algorithm. The programming modifications are developed and shown to be nearly trivial. Several applications of the method for speech analysis are presented along with Fortran programs of the basic and pruned FFT algorithm. The technique described can also be applied effectively for evaluating a narrow region of the frequency domain by pruning a decimation-in-time algorithm."
"The problem of optimizing the organization of fixed-point implementations for first- and second-order digital filters is discussed. The direct and canonical forms are analyzed in detail and compared with each other with regard to the input quantization and roundoff noise effects. A summary of the computation results is plotted in some diagrams depicting on the z plane the zones of greater convenience of either solution."
"The concept of \"position spectrum\" for discrete orthogonal transformations of N-periodic sequences is introduced. It is shown that a position spectrum is analogous to the conventional Fourier phase spectrum. As an illustration, the position spectrum for a modified Hadamard or BIFORE (binary Fourier representation) transform is developed."

"Over the last few years, considerable effort has been devoted to employing the plasma state in applications as widely differing as microwave and optical frequency devices; power generation by thermonuclear fusion; magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and thermionic energy conversion, and the propulsion of spacecraft. In some of these areas intense activity still continues, and encouraging progress is being made. In others the results have been disappointing, and after an initial period of enthusiasm interest has waned. This paper is restricted to such an area, and reviews microwave plasma device research. A few years ago it seemed that a new and useful range of components, including phase shifters, beam-plasma amplifiers, and harmonic generators, might be developed. After a great deal of work, there is still a dearth of serious commercial plasma competitors to existing vacuum tube and solid-state devices. The paper discusses some of the obstacles to microwave plasma device development that have been encountered along the way, and some of the paths that have been taken to circumvent them. It is concluded that the present disappointing situation is likely to persist unless a major breakthrough is made in production of a simple quiescent plasma source, or there is a departure from the present device concepts."
"A bandwidth compression process is described which uses the magnetoelastic normal modes of a ferrimagnetic crystal as independent subharmonic oscillators. The critical power level and mode density for this process are discussed and dynamic range is shown to be strongly dependent upon crystal geometry. Measurements have been made on a device with a 60-MHz input frequency and a 30-MHz output frequency. Spectrograms of voice signals before and after two-to-one bandwidth compression are presented and the possibility of obtaining bandwidth expansion is discussed briefly."
"The selection of stabilizing signals to improve power system dynamic behavior is presented. Some results from modern control theory are used to show how such stabilizing signals may be derived systematically for a turboalternator model connected through a double circuit line to an infinite bus. The closed-loop performance of this nonlinear system model with the derived linear optimal controller is then evaluated for a wide range of input disturbances and operating conditions which include three-phase fault studies with autoreclosure."
"The characteristics of the networks which are composed of many randomly connected threshold elements are investigated with the intention of understanding some aspects of information processing in nervous systems. In these networks, the statistical properties of connection are sufficient to determine the characteristics. Information is carried by the activity level of a network which designates the rate of exciting elements. Dynamics of the activity level is studied. Two statistical parameters, which are sufficient to determine the characteristics of networks, are extracted and the networks are categorized into three classes by these parameters. One is monostable, having only one stable activity level. Another is monostable or bistable according to the average threshold value of the elements. The third is astable or monostable. The characteristics of these three kinds of networks are analyzed in detail. Various systems can be obtained by connecting random networks, where the average thresholds of component networks can be controlled by other networks. The system performances are given. A stable oscillation of a long period is shown to exist in a system composed of two kinds of elements, i.e., excitatory and inhibitory elements, by randomly connecting them. A model for association of ideas is presented."
"The study reported here is concerned with relating the multipath and frequency selective fading characteristics of radio links caused by scatter phenomena to the statistical spatial characteristics of the refractive index. Two specific antenna configurations are studied in detail: the LOS (line-of-sight) case where the two antennas are pointed concentrically and the OTH (over-the-horizon) case where the antennas point along a great circle path. For each of these antenna configurations two scatter situations are considered: isotropic scatter with the propagation medium controlling the focusing of energy and locally isotropic scatter with narrow-beam antennas. In all cases single scattering theory is used and narrow-band signal transmission is assumed. It is found that when multipath is of any importance in causing signal distortion for a LOS link, the scatter portion of the channel may be modeled as a continuum of uncorrelated scatterers. Also OTH links are found to be characterizable in the same way. Single integrals and specific analytic and numerical examples are given relating frequency correlation functions and delay power spectra to the wavenumber spectra of assumed refractive index fluctuations. It is shown that a measurement of the frequency correlation function or delay power spectrum can yield an estimate of the wavenumber spectrum of the refractive index fluctuations."
"Modulation of a hologram for the purpose of selecting different spatial channels may be easily implemented by putting a \"signal\" hologram and a \"carrier\" hologram (sheet-to-sheet) together."
"A general stability criterion of the oscillations in systems containing a memoryless nonlinearity is derived. A new more general form of Loeb's criterion is also obtained by considering the variation of the generalized transfer function of the nonlinear element with frequency."
"A technique for data transmission using basis waveforms in a Euclidean space is presented. An example is used to demonstrate that this technique can give performance superior to that of the duobinary technique."
"A simple approach to obtaining the state equations for electric networks is introduced. This approach can easily accommodate any type of network element. It requires a relatively small number of simultaneous equations. An illustrative example is included."
"A variable bandwidth active filter has been designed by realizing a transfer function similar to that of mutually coupled resonant circuits. The circuit provides approximately a 5:1 variation in 3-dB bandwidth while maintaining the peak magnitude constant within ±1.4 dB."
"When measuring the photoconductivity of low-loss materials at microwave frequencies, it is shown that an initially unbalanced bridge is more sensitive than an initially balanced one. In addition, an expression is derived for the effective conductivity in a material that is nonuniformly excited."
"A simple physical model that predicts the error associated with the monostatic-bistatic equivalence theorem for the case where coupling is significant between sources of scattering is presented. The analysis is discussed in terms of both monochromatic-wave and short-pulse scattering. Experimental verification of the results is provided by isolating the coupling components through use of a high-resolution radar."
"An experimental pulse technique has been developed permitting rapid measurement of absolute surface wave velocity on single crystals to an accuracy of 1 percent or better. A further modification of the technique allows measurement of parts per million changes in surface wave time delay caused by changes in substrate temperature. The technique directly measures the vertical component of particle velocity at the receiver as a function of time and enables one to distinguish clearly between the various types of surface modes, e.g., Rayleigh wave, pseudosurface wave, etc. The method is applicable to any material."
"The development of monolithic, optically written, and electrically read memory elements employing single-crystal barium titanate is described. Both single and multiple-unit structures have been made. These structures can be fabricated using techniques similar to those employed in integrated circuits."
"The use of a capacitor in a monolithic crystal filter to obtain finite poles is well known. Several authors have illustrated the variation of the pole frequencies due to the magnitude of the capacitor. The empirical conclusion is that the larger the capacitor, the closer the pole frequencies to the passband or the steeper the skirt. A simple formula is presented for calculating the precise value of a capacitor required to produce prescribed pole frequencies."
"This letter describes self-pumped parametric effects resulting from the admittance variations of a domain which occur not when the domain grows near the cathode and is quenched at the anode, but when the bias voltage is varied by an RF output voltage. It is shown that a parametric change in admittance appears in a diode self-pumped by a voltage with a fundamental frequency and that additional admittance appears in a diode self-pumped by a voltage with a harmonic frequency."
"The photoemission yield dependency on bandgap energy has been investigated for GaInAs alloys by obtaining a series of spectral response curves for each alloy. The results qualitatively agree with calculated values."
"A receiver for PCM/split-phase signals using an integrate-and-dump filter is optimum only if the system bandwidth is infinite. Restriction of bandwidth results in a performance degradation. The degradation of signal-to-noise ratio is presented as a function of bandwidth-bit duration product and bit patterns. The average probability of bit-error is computed."
"In recent years several papers dealing with the mathematical theory as well as the technical applications of Walsh functions have been published. One method of defining Walsh functions is by using the Rademacher functions and the multiplication law of Walsh functions which is in fact a binary addition modulo 2 (no carry). This letter, however, describes in detail a method of defining Walsh functions by using orthogonal code blocks or the so-called Hadamard matrices. Some advantages of this method are its simplicity and its straightforward hardware implementation."
"The assembly of composite silicon IMPATT diodes for 110-GHz operation with improved power-handling capability is described. Up to 140 mW CW output power at burnout was observed with a three-wafer assembly compared with 110 mW and 74 mW for the best performing double- and single-wafer units, respectively. The efficiencies were approximately 3 percent."
"An implementation of Gaussian reduction of complex matrices by sparse matrix techniques is presented. The computer program described has been specifically tailored to perform frequency analysis of linear circuits within an on-line circuit-design programming system."
 "Some established results in functional analysis yield a simple formula for representing physical systems exactly in terms of their linear behaviors. Although the formula has been exploited to solve bifurcation problems in elasticity and hydrodynamics, its use in system theory remains to be developed."
"A relation is established between two classical equations, allowing the oscillator RF spectrum to be computed from frequency instability in the time domain. An application is made to an internal or external thermal noise perturbated oscillator, providing a more exact RF spectrum than a previous result for the internal noise case."
 "The outputs of 12 packaged IMPATT diodes were successfully combined in a waveguide cavity. The resulting oscillator gave 10.5-watt CW output power at 9.1 GHz. No spurious oscillations were observed during the circuit adjustment. The adjustment was extremely easy and the spectrum of the output was clean."
"An inductor realization technique with RC elements and two transistors operating in the common collector mode is described. The method is suitable for low frequency applications. A discussion on the Q-factor of the inductor is also given."
"Schelkunoff's method of moments has been applied to calculate the radiation resistance of a center-fed dipole antenna with feed points displaced transverse to dipole axis and the results are compared with the conventional theoretical results and are found to be in good agreement. The method suggested is quite simple, fairly accurate, and straightforward."
"In contradiction to earlier views, it is shown that the use of a nonlinear element in tunnel diode trigger circuits does not accelerate the transient process and that it serves mainly to increase the stability and sensitivity of the trigger."
"A deterministic, as opposed to statistical, approach is taken to determine the gain loss due to an arbitrary phase error distribution whose peak magnitude is less than π/√5 rad. The results are in the form of upper and lower bounds expressed in terms of the peak phase error and the illumination-weighted rms phase error in the aperture."
"Some experimental results obtained for the purpose of improving the bandwidth of an S-band three-port stripline circulator are reported. The experimental techniques include triangular dielectric loading, step change in the diameter of a ferrite disk, and use of tailored poles giving circumferential variation of the magnetic field."

"Satellite relays complicate the problem of sharing a limited frequency spectrum that is in great demand. This paper reviews the problem and outlines a general approach for efficient use of orbits and spectrum. The protection of received signals, the equipment capabilities, and systems considerations pertinent to the problem are reviewed before systematically examining the principal direct and scatter modes of interference. Conclusions derived include the following. The full potential use of orbits and spectrum for satellite systems can provide enormous capacities greatly exceeding any current proposals, but it requires careful coordination of many system parameters. The use of spectrum for microwave or satellite relays to fixed terminals could evolve to intense full sharing by both types of service without seriously limiting either one or requiring unreasonable accommodation. The satellite down links for area coverage to small terminals (e.g., mobile and broadcast services) can share fully and intensively the spectrum above VHF that is used for terrestrial mobile and broadcast services without seriously limiting the potential of any of the services. Although the greatest potential capacity of the spectrum lies above 16 GHz, for most down-link applications propagation factors make it more attractive to share the spectrum below about 16 GHz much more intensively before making extensive use of the higher frequencies. Providing the satellite down-link spectrum for area coverage to small terminals deserves priority consideration. For this purpose the UHF band is most attractive; the merit of the spectrum rapidly diminishes for higher frequencies."
"Future manned spaceflight programs may require continuous real-time communications between the spacecraft and the mission control center. This paper examines the feasibility of relay satellite (RS) systems to meet these requirements. Anticipated requirements range from voice and low-speed data for the Skylab and Space Shuttle to television for the Space Station. Frequencies in S, C, X, and K bands (2, 5, 8, and GHz bands, respectively) are considered. Terrestrial radio-relay links may cause interference in the mission spacecraft (MS) and RS and vice versa. Possible remedies include better control of antenna sidelobes and judicious choice of channel frequencies. It is found that INTELSAT IV offers a technically feasible means of providing voice and data communications but not TV. A new dedicated satellite system can meet the requirements with two geostationary satellites both of which are visible to a single earth station (ES) in the United States. A shared satellite system, catering to other potential users as well as to manned spacecraft, offers the possibility of reduced cost to individual users. Satellite configurations for both dedicated and shared systems are presented. The satellites can be launched by boosters of the Thor-Delta class if the links between satellite and spacecraft operate in K band."
"This paper describes a program carried out by the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of satellite communications to mobile platforms, particularly aircraft. The VHF/UHF 225-400-MHz band was selected to permit the use of simple, hemispherical coverage aircraft antennas. Experiments were carried out in 1965-1966 to establish initial feasibility by measuring the electromagnetic noise environment in this band and the nature of the multipath occurring on the link between a satellite and a nondirectional aircraft antenna. A satellite, LES-3, was orbited in 1965 to provide a propagation signal source for the latter measurements. Two satellites, LES-5 and LES-6, were orbited in 1967 and 1968, respectively, to serve as UHF repeaters for communications experiments. A multiple-access modulation system, TATS, was developed and tested in ground and aircraft environments with these satellites. In addition, a flush-mounted, crossed-slot aircraft antenna with good coverage properties was developed."
"Amplitude fluctuations produced by small irregularities in electron density in the F layer of the ionosphere can be a problem to communication and navigation systems in the very-high frequency-ultra-high frequency (VHF-UHF) range. Recent measurements are shown with emphasis on high and equatorial latitude observations. At high latitudes an irregularity region exists whose lower boundary reaches 57° invariant latitude near midnight. During magnetic storms the boundary descends to lower latitudes and the fading becomes deeper. Over the polar cap scintillations are somewhat diminished. Observing synchronous satellites through the irregularity region, deep fading is seen frequently with fade rates to one per second. Irregularities produce deep scintillations in the VHF range ±15° from the geomagnetic equator. In equatorial regions maximum occurrence of high level scintillations takes place between 2100 and 2400 during the equinoxes; a minimum occurrence is observed in the solstices. The data for various latitudes have been placed in statistical form, i.e., distribution of amplitudes for 15-min samples as well as for periods of one year and longer. To minimize the effect of this phenomenon on satellite transmissions, the systems designer can utilize the amplitude distributions, fading rates, and depths in designing his modulation."
"The theories describing the effects of the troposphere on satellite communication systems operating in the microwave region are reviewed. The results of computations based upon the theories and atmospheric models are presented and compared with available experimental data. From the model computations it is seen that rain causes the major propagation problems for the frequency bands allocated to or proposed for allocation to the satellite communications service. Two effects are dominant: attenuation due to rainfall along the line-of-sight and interference between two systems operating at the same frequency and beyond each other's radio horizon due to rain scatter. The methods for calculating the magnitude of the effects of rain given the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity are available. The statistical data required for the prediction of the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity are not available."
"The increased communications demands of a rapidly expanding technology are requiring the systems designer to look to higher frequency bands to support high data rate communications links. Virtually all terrestrial and satellite communications systems presently in service operate in bands below 10 GHz. The frequency band from 10 to 300 GHz, commonly called \"millimeter waves,\" offers the potential for relieving the overcrowded situation at the lower frequencies. The propagation characteristics of millimeter wavelength transmission are significantly different than at the longer wavelengths, however, and propagation data is required by the systems designer as a first step in evaluating the performance characteristics of operational links. The Applications Technology Satellite (ATS-V) millimeter wave propagation experiment is the first flight experiment for the determination of long- and short-term attenuation statistics of operational millimeter wavelength earth-space links as a function of defined meteorological conditions. The ATS-V experiment, launched August 12,1969, is providing the first propagation data from an orbiting geosynchronous spacecraft in the 15-GHz (downlink) and 32-GHz (uplink) frequency bands. Several stations in the continental U.S. and Canada have been operating with the downlink transmission from the satellite since late September 1969. The spacecraft transmitter is an all solid-state phase modulated unit that provides up to 250 mW of CW power at 15.3 GHz. The 31.65- GHz uplink signal is derived from a frequency stabilized klystron, varactor upconverter, and 1000 W traveling wave tube amplifier. A multilevel computer processing program generates propagation statistics for attenuation as a function of rainfall rate, sky temperature, radar backscatter, and other meteorological variables. Downlink measurements made at the NASA Rosman, N. C. station typically show attenuations of 1 to 3 dB in light rains or dense fog; 3 to 7 dB in continuous rains (5 to 50 mm/h), and a number of fades exceeding 12 dB in heavy thunderstorms. Uplink fades of up to 18 dB in heavy rains have been observed. Correlation of measured attenuation with ground measured rainfall rate was low for a single gauge but improved significantly with height averaging of 10 gauges. Correlation of measured attenuation with sky temperature recorded on a small aperture radiometer was very good for most storms. Valid predictions of attenuation from 16-GHz sky temperature measurements were observed for up to 15 dB of measured attenuation. The uplink to downlink attenuation ratio varied with each precipitation event and often varied during a single storm. The ratio has ranged from 2:1 to 4:1 during heavy precipitation periods."
"The communications subsystem comprises the 30-ft parabolic reflector, the composite feed system, and the multiple frequency transponder. For high reliability, redundancy is used as required in these assemblies. The high effective radiated power (ERP) provided by this subsystem allows it to function as part of the experiments, in addition to performing as the interface between the spacecraft and the ground stations. Therefore, in addition to meeting the communications design requirements, the subsystem has been designed to meet the requirements for performance of several technical objectives, namely accurate pointing of a radiated beam to either an earth station or another satellite, and high ERP. Successful performance of these objectives is a requirement in the Position Location and Aircraft Communications Experiment, Tracking and Data Relay Experiment, and Instructional Television experiments. The composite feed subassembly, which provides radiating and receiving elements for the S, L, C, and UHF frequency bands, is used in conjunction with the high-gain RF reflector to provide optimum antenna performance. The transponder is the interface between the onboard experiments and ground stations and comprises the receiver, IF amplifier, and transmitter assemblies which perform frequency generation, translation, and power amplification functions. The receivers, operating at C, S, and L band, perform preamplification, and down-convert the RF signal to the 150-MHz IF. The IF amplifier assembly uses input switching to allow connection of a down-converter output to any of the three IF amplifiers; and output switching is used to connect an IF output to the desired up-converter. This achieves high reliability with maximum flexibility. The transmitters up-convert the IF signals which are then amplified by a traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA) or solid-state amplifier and fed to the appropriate composite feed elements. A synthesizer provides multiple mixing frequencies for up and down conversion in coherent and noncoherent modes of operation."
"Expressions have been derived that describe the output spectra (i.e., signal plus distortion) of a saturating amplifier when the input consists of a large number of independent carriers whose amplitudes, bandwidths, and center frequencies may be independently specified. The resulting equations have been programmed on the GE 635 computer using the fast Fourier transform algorithm, permitting rapid computation of the output spectra for very complex input signal formats. Program outputs have been checked against the results of previous authors, e.g., Cahn [1] and against a measured transfer characteristic of a Hughes model 24H traveling wave tube, with good agreement. The program has been found very useful in design optimization studies of channelized communications repeaters with up to 60 channels."
"The unique multipoint interconnection capabilities of satellite communication networks place a burden on the communications system designer to achieve highly efficient transmission capacity in the face of a very wide range of network requirements. The ability of various types of multiple-access systems to meet these requirements is the subject of this paper. INTELSAT, recognizing that the frequency division multiplex-frequency modulation, frequencY division multiple access (FDM-FM-FDMA) method it currently uses has advantages in some applications but is not optimum for the multiple-access environment, has supported the development of two-digital multiple-access communications techniques: single channel per carrier frequency division multiple access (SPADE) and time division multiple access (TDMA). These two techniques are discussed in detail and the paper concludes with a presentation of a promising multiple-access technique of the future which includes time division switching on board the satellite."
"The intermodulation due to the traveling-wave tube (TWT) is analyzed for the case where arbitrarily modulated carriers and Gaussian noise are amplified through the TWT. Both AM-PM conversion effects and nonlinear amplification in the TWT are considered. The possibility of reducing intermodulation for system improvement is also discussed."
"Two kinds of processing repeaters which may find application on communication satellites in the near future are described. The type I repeater allows access only if the transmitted signal contains a predetermined code structure. This serves three purposes: first, unauthorized users are excluded, second, co-channel interfering signals are not retransmitted on the downlink, so as not to waste a portion of the satellite transmitter power, and, third, removal of the interference signal at the satellite avoids having to do this at the ground receiving terminal. Thus such a repeater would find particular application where there are a large number of ground receiving stations. The type 2 repeater routes signals received at its N input terminals to be transmitted at N output terminals, thus acting as a \"switchboard in the sky.\" Two purposes are served: first, the satellite capacity is more fully utilized in the presence of fluctuating traffic demands, and, second, single-frequency transmission and reception are possible for user ground stations, thus simplifying these stations and still allowing communication to any station in the network. It is established when the type 1 repeater is able to increase the satellite communication capability beyond that of a simple repeater and further that fairly simple filtering is sufficient on the satellite. For the type 2 repeater, a proposed frequency control plan minimizes the filtering required on the satellite where frequency division multiplex is used and reduces the amount of switching required on the satellite to N single-pole N-throw switches where time division multiplex is used without the requirement of any memory on the satellite. A summary of present-day translating repeaters, as used in the Intelsats III and IV and DSCS II satellites, is included."
"A multibeam antenna system and-combiner switch capable of producing a variable-coverage radiation pattern are described. The antenna consists of a waveguide lens illuminated by a 19-element feedhorn array. The combiner switch consists of a corporate arrangement of variable power dividers; the latter is made up of two phase shifters and two conventional hybrid power-dividers. An earth-coverage radiation pattern with less than 2-dB ripple and an antenna gain ≈ 20 dB is obtained by equally exciting all beams of the muItibeam antenna simultaneously. Excitation of a single feedhorn results in a narrow beam with an antenna gain ≈ 30 dB and a near-in sidelobe level less -20 dB. The side|obe level can be reduced appreciably by appropriately exciting the adjacent feedhorns. The frequency bandwidth corresponding to 0.5-dB decrease in antenna gain is 10 percent. A technique for computing the radiation properties of the antenna is described; the agreement with measured data is shown to be excellent."
"Photovoltaic solar arrays are the principal means of converting solar energy to electrical energy for satellites. Array configurations depend on the spacecraft stabilization concept, orbit, and power requirements. The current generation of communication satellites are spin-stabilized in synchronous equatorial orbits; their arrays are spinning cylinders. As satellite power requirements increase, it is expected that the trend will be toward extendible arrays on three-axis stabilized spacecraft. The single crystal silicon cell is the basic building block of today's solar arrays and is expected to be for some time, although cadmium sulfide thin film solar cells may offer several advantages once their development is completed. Several of the considerations in the design of solar arrays are discussed: radiation effects on solar cells, substrates, selection of array voltage, analysis of shadows, and overall performance."
"The research performed on a solid Teflon pulsed plasma thruster (PPT), four of which are currently providing east-west stationkeeping for the Lincoln Laboratory LES-6 communications satellite, is presented. A detailed description of the thruster operation supported by diagnostic measurements is given. First a circuit model was developed for the thruster which accurately predicted impulse bit (∼ 31 µNċs), specific impulse (∼ 300s), and gave an energy balance. It showed that ∼30 percent of the energy is lost in capacitor dissipation. Most of the remainder is lost to ionization and heating. Image converter pictures of the discharge showed a traveling plasma and a standing arc. A number of plasma diagnostics were set up, including a He-Ne Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a K-band microwave interferometer. These measured electron densities in the arc discharge and downstream. A spectrographic analysis of the plasma showed that neutral, singly, doubly, and triply ionized atoms of carbon and fluorine were present and that the greater the degree of ionization the higher the specie's velocity. A Faraday cup examination of the exhaust plume showed the beamwidth of the ∼36° and ionization no greater than 10 percent. Velocity and ionization data imply that the ions could conceivably account for all of the thruster's performance."
"The Josephson junction acts as a nonlinear lossless inductor and can be applied for mixing and parametric amplification in the microwave region. Since an alternating current can be generated in the junction by an applied dc voltage, a dc power flow must be taken into consideration. Energy relations for the Josephson junction are derived which are similar to the Manley-Rowe equations but with an additional term for the dc power. These equations show the possibility of realizing dc-pumped parametric amplifiers."

"The impact of computers on circuit analysis and design and the advent of new electronic devices and integrated circuits have generated much interest in nonlinear circuit theory. Recent successes in the analysis of large-scale systems using network models have further enhanced the importance of the subject. A key to the understanding and analysis of nonlinear circuits is the study of nonlinear resistive networks both in theory and in computation. In the study of nonlinear resistive networks it is necessary to know the global properties of nonlinear functions. Thus Palais' global inverse function theorem is of paramount importance. In addition, a global implicit function theorem is often needed. The latter is given in this paper. We apply the global theorems to derive results on nonlinear networks with unique solutions and with multiple solutions. The theory obtained for networks with multiple solutions can be used to analyze and design bistable circuits. In computation, we extend Katzenelson's piecewise-linear analysis to general nonlinear resistive networks. For networks which have a unique solution under all possible inputs, the method converges in a finite number of steps. In addition, we present an efficient method of computing input-output characteristics of networks with single or multiple solutions."
"A summary is given of properties of Love and Rayleigh waves in stratified isotropic media. The study of propagation of such waves in anisotropic and piezoelectric media, carried out in view of obtaining \"pure\" modes, shows that two modes can be \"pure\" and only one of them at a time can be piezoelectrically stiffened. The Rayleigh wave is stiffened if the sagittal plane is a plane of symmetry whereas the Love wave is stiffened if the perpendicular to the sagittal plane is a binary axis. The problems in devising dispersive delay lines using these waves are discussed and the pairs of materials which seem to be the most interesting ones are given together with the different excitation methods and expected performance of these delay lines relating to large bandwidths and high compression ratios. The results of experiments carried out with Love and Rayleigh waves excited by ceramic transducers directly bonded onto the layer show that the total untuned insertion losses can be less than 20 dB with a 2.5-MHz bandwidth and less than 50 dB with a 100-MHz bandwidth. Also described is the performance of a delay line whose time delay variation is nearly 8 µs with a 30-MHz bandwidth, the central frequency being 32.5 MHz."
"A device suitable for image storage and display applications is described in which the image is stored as a spatially varying birefringence and can, by means of suitably polarized light, either be observed directly or projected onto a viewing screen. The basic device consists of a sandwiched structure of uniform thickness layers, comprising transparent electrodes, a photoconductive film, and a plate of fine-grained ferroelectric ceramic. In order to establish a preferred orientation of the polarization in the plane of the plate, a uniform strain is induced in the plate by placing it either in tension or compression (\"strain biasing\"). The plate then becomes birefringent, with the principal axes of the optical indicatrix along the strain axes. The magnitude of this birefringence can be controlled by an electric field applied in the thickness direction, and this forms the basis of the device operation. In operation, the image to be stored is projected or scanned onto the photoconductive film. A voltage applied to the transparent electrodes develops, in the ceramic, a transverse field having an intensity modulated by the photoconductive film. When the field is removed, the desired image is stored as a spatial modulation of the birefringence of the ceramic plate. To erase the image the entire structure is flooded with light in the presence of an electric field in the reverse direction, and the plate regains its initial state of uniform birefringence. A large number of experimental devices have been fabricated and tested in the laboratory. In addition to describing the basic device structure, experimental results are presented showing the level of performance obtained from present devices, and a physical interpretation of device operation in terms of domain switching processes is provided."
"The synthesis of nonuniform Iossless transmission lines, an important problem arising in fields such as waveguide design, acoustics, electrical circuit design, and scattering theory, is discussed entirely in the time domain. It is shown that corresponding to every (impulse-response) function satisfying certain regularity conditions and the passivity condition there is a lossless line whose taper is simply related to the impulse response through an integral equation. In particular, this correspondence is unique for lines along which the velocity is constant. The proofs use only elementary results from functional analysis, the theory of partial differential equations, and some well-known physical aspects of lossless lines."
"Acoustic surface waves offer several advantages in the construction of delay lines and filters in the UHF range.

"It is shown that the motion of an arc being described as a temperature cloud can be divided into two parts, one being the relative velocity of the arc phenomenon with respect to the mass flow and the other the mass motion itself. The first relative motion is determined by the equation for the change of internal energy with time, the second mass flow has to be calculated by means of the magnetohydrodynamic and continuity equations. Three groups of examples are given in each of which one of the three velocities disappears. In the first group, no mass flow exists and the motion of the arc is caused by various types of inhomogeneous heating. In the second group, the arc itself does not move due to the opposing effects of mass motion and relative arc motion. In the last group, the arc follows the mass flow without relative motion. As long as the boundary conditions do not change from the standpoint of the arc the motion continues steadily. If, however, the boundary conditions form any type of obstacles, the motion of the arc ends up in a new equilibrium position, a displacement occurring."
"Experiments were conducted upon a 130-A 1.1-atm balanced argon arc over a range of velocities from 5.09 to 13.13 m/s; electrode spacing was 12.7 mm. Two stable modes of operation were found: the colinear mode, with arc attachments fix at the apexes of the electrodes, and the upstream mode, with arc attachments on the upstream sides of the electrodes. Below a critical velocity of about 5 m/s, the colinear mode only was found. For the colinear mode, arc isotherm distributions, cross-sectional shape, and profile varied markedly with distance along its length; these were observed to be relatively uniform for the upstream mode. Significant lateral broadening of both configurations was found. The effect of velocity upon the upstream mode was to decrease the relative broadening of the plasma."
"Long laboratory sparks are often considered to be miniature lightning. The salient properties of 4-m sparks created by impulse breakdown between a negative rod and a grounded plane by the Westinghouse Trafford 6.4 MV impulse generator are compared with those properties of natural lightning. In particular, a comparison is made of the luminous processes associated with breakdown, the current, voltage, power, and energy inputs to the discharges, the radiated visible spectra, the temperature, electron density, and pressure in the discharge channels, the absolute broad-band radiation in the visible and near infrared wavelength range, and the radiated acoustic signals. The spark return stroke most resembles a weak subsequent stroke in a multiple stroke lightning flash. The leader processes of the spark differ considerably from those of lightning."
"An analysis is presented of the effects of induced radial velocity on the thermal behavior of a nonstationary electric arc. An interrupted dc arc is simulated by treating the linearized equations for a cylindrical plasma, initially at a uniform temperature, when the wall temperature is suddenly changed by a small amount from the gas temperature. Due to compressibility, a radial wave motion is set up within the gas which causes rapid interior temperature changes on a time scale much smaller than the conduction time constant. For example in a 5-mm diameter SF6arc, which is initially at a temperature of 11 000°K, the central temperature will change by 20 percent in 1 µs, while the conduction time constant is 100 µs. The possible importance of this behavior for circuit breaker arcs is discussed."
"The equilibrium composition of SF6was calculated for temperatures from 1000 to 45 000°K and for pressures from 1 to 16 atm. The usual thermodynamic functions and transport properties were also computed. Considering the arc column in axially flowing gas as a plasma generator, the power balance and momentum conservation equations are formulated and solved with certain simplifying assumptions. The solution gives the developing flow and electrical parameters as a function of distance along the nozzle. Arc voltages are predicted which agree with available data. Clarification is given on two processes contributing to dielectric recovery: axial sweeping away of the arc channel, and its conductance decay by thermal diffusivity, during the current fall approaching current zero."
"The results of experiments on stationary and nonstationary arcs in SF6are summarized. High temperature gas properties, like the electrical and thermal conductivity as well as the theoretically predicted plasma demixing effects, are determined by electrical and spectroscopic measurements. Investigations on interrupted dc arcs give insight into the energy transport mechanism of the arcs. The transient temperature behavior of gas blast interrupted arcs is measured. Finally, the application of the investigations to circuit breaker arcs is discussed. The following principal results have been found: From the lower time constant of blown N2arcs in comparison to SF6arcs above 10 000 K it follows that the good quenching properties of SF6must be due to processes taking place below 10 000 K. This agrees also with the time-constant measurements in the interrupted cascade arc: at lower temperature--below approximately 8000 K-- the conductance decay in N2is very much slower than in SF6. Further, these measurements revealed that the steep descent in SF6is not caused by electron attachment but is due to energy transport mechanisms. Experimental work about the plasma properties on steady-state arcs, including demixing effects, is in good agreement with theory. Finally the ac experiments show that the temperature profile of the blown ac arcs has a nearly rectangular shape. Variations in current affect mainly the diameter of the arc whereas the temperature variations are fairly small."
"An approximate integral formulation of the thermal boundary layer equation is derived for a steady arc in a nozzle. This differential equation defines the constriction of the arc radius in terms of a heat transfer parameter γ which represents the ratio of all radial heat losses to axial convection. These radial losses include both optically thin radiation and turbulent heat transfer as estimated from a mixing length model. Numerical solutions of the continuity, energy, and momentum equations have been obtained within an arc radius determined from the above equation. These solutions show the effects of various degree of arc constriction upon the velocity and temperature profiles and the arc time constant. The calculations make use of the thermodynamic, transport, and radiative properties of SF6evaluated for a throat pressure of 10 atm for temperatures up to 100 000°K. Solutions have been obtained for arc currents of 100 and 1000 A. It is found that a 100-A arc will have a time constant of several microseconds if the arc radius is of the order of 0.5 mm. Voltage gradients corresponding to this degree of constriction are approximately 200 V/cm."
"It has been shown that the relative rate of decrease of conductance of the arc, in the following called RRDC, can be split in terms depending on the changing of the quantities: arc length, arc cross section, peak arc temperature and temperature profile, and the order of magnitude of the different terms has been estimated. For an experimental air blast breaker current and voltage near current zero have been measured for the case of a short line fault and the RRDC function has been calculated in the time interval 20-1 µs before current zero. It has been shown that the often used theory of Mayr is not applicable over the whole of the investigated time interval and also that the theory of Cassie does not apply in the time interval preceding 10 µs before current zero. In the last 10 µs before current zero Cassie's theory describes the investigated air blast breaker quite well. The transient behavior of the arc conductance (e.g., Cassie's time constant) in the air blast breaker has been found to be of the same order of magnitude (approximately 0.5 µs) as has been reported for SF6gas blast breakers. This has been explained by the fact that the RRDC function is mainly dependent on the variation in the arc cross section, which seems to be only slightly dependent on the quenching medium. Because this reasoning is only valid before current zero, greater differences of the transient arc behavior between different types of breakers may occur at and after current zero."
"Experiments with high-power arcs interacting with a sonic high-pressure gas flow suggest an energy dissipation mechanism much more effective than thermal conduction and radiation. It is shown that the arc behavior is almost completely controlled by turbulence phenomena. By means of a phenomenological turbulence theory, an expression for the turbulent heat conductivity is derived which is used to solve the energy balance. The static arc voltage and the temperature profiles calculated for currents up to 50 kA and pressures of some 100 N/cm2(≈ 10 atmospheres) depend on a characteristic turbulence length that is determined by comparison with the experiments. For radially blasted arcs with a length of a few centimeters, this turbulence length is shown to be constant over a wide range of current and pressure but varying with the arc geometry. The high energy dissipation leads to arc voltage gradients that may attain several kilovolts per centimeter. Such high gradients imply deviations from local thermal equilibrium, especially at smaller currents. For such a case, the solution of the energy balance requires the calculation of nonequilibrium plasma composition and transport properties for plasmas with different electron and gas temperatures. Numerical calculations have been performed for nitrogen."
"Experiments were carried out at a Siemens laboratory with specially designed circuit breakers to investigate the relationship between gas flow and arc behavior for various shapes and arrangements of gas nozzles, as well as for different types of gas and pressure conditions. The current, post-arc current, and voltage measurements were supplemented by the employment of optical methods. By using a high-speed schlieren camera, it was possible to obtain valuable information on the flow characteristics and density of the gas surrounding the arc and to estimate the influence of these quantities on the arc-quenching capacity of a breaker. The interaction of the electric power system and the arc could also be taken into account by using a dynamic arc model."
"Measurements are presented of the voltage fall across the electrode region of low-current carbon arcs when test current pulses are injected through the arc gap at some time (less than 100 µs) following rapid removal of the arc current. The results thus shed some light upon the thermal reignition phenomena of refractory electrodes. A model is proposed to describe the observed behavior at low injection current levels. This model may also be of assistance in describing the behavior of hot probes in high-pressure plasmas. Although the model is not extended to high current levels, a discussion is presented of the electrode region behavior for currents at which mechanisms apparently form, which are necessary for reignition and steady-state conduction through the electrode regions."
"Arc-backs produced by continuously raising the stress on a high-voltage single-gap single-anode mercury-arc valve are preceded by a change in reverse current before failure occurs. On the cycle at which arc-back occurs the reverse current rises rapidly to about 10 A at peak reverse voltage (140 kV maximum). Subsequently, the reverse current decreases and then rises again steadily for several hundred microseconds. Failure occurs during this second rise of current. These changes in reverse current prior to arc-back are reproducible. The peak reverse voltage reached on the cycle at which arc-back sets in is also reproducible (to ±10 percent). This type of arc-back is interpreted as a sequential process that is initiated by ignition, at peak voltage, of a stable high-voltage discharge in the valve. The subsequent rise of reverse current which leads to failure is attributed to a rise in gas pressure within the valve due to ion bombardment from the high-voltage discharge. The measured delay of 60 µs from the point of rapid rise in reverse current to the start of the final growth of current suggests that mercury vapor is evolved from the negatively biased main anode to cause a rise in gas pressure. Detection of precursor currents might allow suspect valves to be blocked in time to prevent the occurrence of a full arc-back."
"Of the various processes occurring in an arc at high currents one of the most important with regard to application is the formation of an anode spot and the consequent melting associated with it. Vacuum arc devices depend for their operation on the formation of a high current transient metal-vapor arc. The limiting current in a particular design may be set by destructive melting at the anode. It is shown that it is possible to raise the threshold current for anode spot formation in a metal-vapor arc by suitably changing the electrode geometry. From a study of a few simple electrode geometries a set of guidelines has been evolved governing the choice of electrode geometry. As an illustration of the efficacy of these guidelines and the means of implementing them in practice it is shown how it is possible, with successive modifications of a coaxial-cylindrical electrode structure, to attain a peak current of 72 kA for a damped 60-Hz current wave without electrode melting."
"Properties of dc vacuum arcs between copper electrodes are studied in both a vacuum interrupter and a metal walled arc chamber. Maximum ion currents of ∼8 to 20 percent of the arc current (100 to 3000 A) are drawn from the diffuse arc plasma when the bounding metal wall or shield is biased negative. This maximum ion current is a fundamental arc property independent of wall diameter, anode diameter, and electrode spacing. The geometric dependence of the wall ion current, together with observations of isotropic vapor and ion emission from the cathode, indicates that the cathode regions adjacent to the cathode spots are the predominant sources of ionization for the plasma. Assuming single ionization, 55 percent of the vapor leaving these regions is ionized. Starvation phenomena in the anode region remote from the cathode spots lead to anode voltage drop and anode spot formation. Post arc currents reveal a mean ion speed during arcing of ≈8×105cm/s. This mean speed may be acquired in the cathode region by acceleration from a potential maximum."
"A review is made of the approaches and approximations used by different authors to calculate coefficients of collisional-radiative ionization (β) and recombination (α). In calculating these quantities, consideration is given to a wide range of varying conditions in plasmas, and account is taken of different factors violating thermodynamic equilibrium, such as a possible departure from a Maxwellian distribution of free electrons, radiation escape with allowance for reabsorption, etc. Simple analytical expressions are given for β and α, as well as calculation results for plasmas of different compositions and different parameters. Experimental studies are also discussed in which β and α are measured. Calculation and experiment are compared and found in fair agreement. Special attention is given to major factors of nonequilibrium, affecting the rate of electron density change in different experimental conditions."
"A high current arc was developed between carbon electrodes in H2, SF6, He, Ar, and air at an initial pressure higher than 1 atm. The current peak was above 5 kA and the duration of the current was 250 µs. The temporal and spatial changes of plasma parameters were measured by time-resolved spectrography and high-speed framing camera. The electron density of the plasma was estimated from the Stark broadening of the lines, Hβ, C II 4267 Å, He I 4471 Å, and He I 5876 Å. Our observations show the following: The arc space is divided into two regions, the bright narrow core and the broad outer flame. The electron density of the core is estimated to be of the order of 1018cm-3and an electron temperature of the order of 104°K is obtained at current peak. Even after current zero, the electron density keeps the order of 1017cm-3regardless of the kind of gas."
"Measurements and calculations of temperatures, densities, and field-strength-current characteristics of cascade arcs burning in noble gases under atmospheric pressure are reported. The evaluation of measured arc data assuming Saha equilibrium [complete local thermal equilibrium (LTE)] is not in agreement with the detailed solution of the balance equations. The temperatures of electrons and heavy particles and the density of electrons and neutrals have to be determined from the set of rate equations, from the equation of state, connection with the electron energy balance and the equation of state, the energy balance of the electron gas, and of the total plasma. Solutions of these equations are compared with results following from measured line intensities only solving the rate equations in connection with the electron energy balance and the equation of state. For helium, both methods give results which agree within a few percent. The deviations from Saha equilibrium are caused by diffusion and the overpopulation of ground state atoms. The excited atoms, however, are nearly in equilibrium with free electrons in the range of electron densities reached in our experiment (partial LTE). Measurements of E-I characteristics agree with calculated data, if diffusion is taken into account. A simple criterion for the limit between diffusion-dominated plasma and a plasma in thermal equilibrium is derived."
"The electrical and thermal conductivities at atmospheric pressure of nitrogen and hydrogen as determined from arc experiments are reviewed for temperatures up to 26 000°K. First results of a high pressure argon program applying similar experimental and analytical techniques are included."
"The results of experimental investigations into the transport properties of low-temperature plasma carried out since 1960 in the Institute for High Temperatures of the USSR Academy of Sciences are summed up. Serving as the source of plasma was a well-stabilized dc arc. Properties of argon, nitrogen, air, and carbon dioxide plasma were studied at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures ranging from 7000° to 16 000°K. Data are presented on electric and thermal conductivity, total radiation of the aforementioned gases, as well as the results of investigations of argon viscosity up to 13 000°K."
"The form factor method for the determination of thermal conductivity is applied to experimental results obtained with a cascade arc in nitrogen. Experimental and theoretical thermal conductivities agree, even at temperatures above 10000°K if rather high radiation losses are taken into account. This result does not change significantly when reabsorption is considered by means of an absorption form factor and the total absorbed power."
"An experimental technique has been developed for measuring rate constants of electron attaching reactions as well as ion-molecule reactions in plasma at 2000-3000°K. Reaction product ions are mass analyzed and rate constants are obtained from plots of the collected ion current. The rate constant for O-formation from N2O varies from about 3 to 9×10-9cm3/s over the temperature range of 2400-3000°K while the rate constant for F-formation from SF6varies from 2.8 to 4×10-10cm3/s for temperatures from 2775 to 3000°K. A brief survey of experimental techniques for measuring electron attachment rate constants at lower temperatures is also given, together with a comparison of these rate constants and present high-temperature values."
"The results of an investigation of the plasma parameters generated by a large V-groove cathode discharge are presented. Stable plasmas with electron densities up to 2×1012cm-3have been obtained in a 30-cm diameter chamber. The electron temperature is about 1200°K and is independent of discharge current and gas pressure over the range, 0.3 to 0.9 torr. The discharge operates in much the same fashion as a conventional brush cathode discharge but with lower operating voltage for equal current densities. It is shown that the plasma is beam generated and the dominant electron loss mechanism in the steady state is electron-ion recombination. However, although most electrons are lost by recombination, diffusion losses still play a strong role in determining the electron density profile. Some measurements of primary electrons in a helium negative glow are presented. The measured flux of the high energy electrons is an exponential function of pd/V2where p is the helium pressure, d is the distance from the edge of the cathode fall and V is the discharge voltage. Some data on microwave noise radiation near the plasma frequency are also presented. In particular, the noise radiation near the cathode is shown to be proportional to the flux of high energy electrons near this electrode. Data are shown which correlate the high energy flux and the peak noise radiation."
"Measurements were made on steady-state gas discharges maintained by RF power in air at atmospheric pressure. The frequency range 1-30 MHz was covered. It was found that these discharges operate as either RF glow or RF arc discharges. The characteristics of each are very similar to those of the corresponding dc discharge types. These RF discharges are quenched after each half-cycle and must be reignited in the following half-cycle. The minimum voltage for reignition is about 350 V. After reignition the discharge voltage is high (≥275 V) for glows and low (≥30 V) for arcs. The discharge type can alternate with polarity. The resulting asymmetric voltage-current characteristic can cause rectification. By their non-linear behavior discharges can produce high-order harmonics of the frequency at which they are maintained. These discharge properties account for various interference problems caused by parasitic RF discharges in the vicinity of high-power RF transmitters."
"The spectrum of a high-pressure tin chloride-iodide-mercury arc has a strong visible continuum and for this reason is potentially a good source of white light. The temperature profile of this arc was determined by adding Cul2and measuring the radial emission of the 510.6- and 513.3-nm copper lines. At 400 W, the center arc temperature is 5700°K. Relative tin pressure was determined as a function of arc radius. The radial distribution of the continuum emission was determined at a number of wavelength regions in the visible and UV. These data are consistent with the postulate that SnCl is one of the principal sources of the continuum radiation from this arc."
"A single-fluid local thermal equilibrium (LTE) model used to predict composition, material functions, and temperature profiles for arc discharges in complex mixtures is reviewed. Results are given for the application of the model to two metal halide discharges used in arc lamps, but predicted arc properties such as central temperature, radiative output, and electrical impedance differ from those observed."
"In the last half of the 1960s, new high-intensity discharge light sources based on a halogen cycle have made considerable impact on the lighting market. Such light sources depend on the volatilization of halide compounds to introduce a variety of otherwise nonvolatile metals into a high-pressure arc in a fused silica tube. The excitation of these metal atoms in the arc then produces the characteristic spectrum of the metal; the incorporation of several different metals permits the generation of a number of wavelengths of light, i.e., substantially white light. These lamps combine the high output in a compact size of mercury lamps (to which they are similar in appearance) with the high efficiency and color qualities of cool white fluorescent lamps. Efficiencies as high as 100 Im/W are available in 1000-W lamps. Metal halide lamps are available from a number of manufacturers in this country and abroad and are finding wide application in industrial and commercial lighting, as well as in outdoor lighting installations where color quality is important."
"If the transport properties of a gas are known, solutions of the energy balance of a wall-stabilized arc can be obtained and may be used for the design of particular arcs. The method is illustrated with argon arcs in the temperature range 8000°K ≤T≤25 000°K and at different pressures up to 100 atm. Nomographs containing the computed arc parameters allow the optimization of an arc column if the effects of radiation absorption, flow fields, and magnetic fields are negligible. Comparisons of the presented data with experimental results obtained at 1 atm and 50 atm show good agreement and confirm the results."
"The characteristics of rare gas flashlamps are reviewed. Data on the spectral distribution and impedance characteristics are presented as a function of current density. Problems of acoustic and thermal damage affecting lamp life are discussed with an indication of directions for further research."
"Measurement of optical properties of plasmas is de scribed as an important application of the gas-driven shock tube. The electrical engineering context is the study and application of plasmas having temperatures of order 1eV (11 600°K) for which both atomic and collective properties need to be known. The gas driven shock tube heats samples of gas to temperatures of 9000-13 000°K at total pressures of 10-20 atm. Steady state conditions during which the gas is in collisional thermal equilibrium persist for 100-200 µs. Spectral line emission (e.g., H, C, C+, P, P+, Fe, Fe+, O, U, U+, U++) and continuum radiation are correlated with the measured thermodynamic state of the gas to obtain either absolute transition probabilities, Stark broadening, and Stark shift parameters for the particular lines, or complete tabulations of optical depth versus wavelength for complex and incompletely classified spectra. The atomic data, as well as some newly developed spectroscopic techniques, facilitate the measurement of composition, temperature, pressure, and electron density in high temperature plasma devices. Measured optical depths of uranium plasmas already directly test predictions vital to the design of proposed, gas-core fission reactors."
"In recent years, the basic study and concepts of the interaction between radiation and matter have found application in aerodynamic problems of engineering interest. This paper discusses three such problems actively being examined at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL): 1) thermally radiating high-temperature shock layers, 2) electric arc-driven wind tunnels, and 3) gas dynamic lasers. Special emphasis is given to the area of gas dynamic lasers. New research results recently obtained at NOL are presented and discussed. Moreover, in the same context, an overview is made of each subject in order to whet the enthusiasm of the reader to look more thoroughly into these interesting areas, whether he be an aerodynamicist, electrical engineer, plasma physicist, or any physical scientist or engineer interested in radiation and matter."
"A technique of magnetically stabilizing the position of the plasma column and the resulting inversion region in lower pressure flowing molecular lasers is described. A transverse magnetic field, mutually perpendicular to the discharge axial electric field and the gas flow velocity, is employed to maintain the electrical discharge column parallel with the optic axis. The magnetic stabilization of the discharge is analyzed in terms of the Lorentz forces and the resulting ambipolar drifts of the plasma. A comparison with magnetically stabilized arcs is presented. Supporting experimental data obtained for pure gases and typical laser gas mixtures are given. The operating characteristics of the cross-field CO2laser which employs a premixed gas flow channeled transverse to the stabilized discharge to provide convective gas cooling are discussed. The experimental results of a parametric study on the dependence of gain and power output upon gas flow velocities, magnetic field, gas mixtures, and pressure are presented. The operation of the first premixed CW electrically initiated chemical laser has been achieved using cross-field magnetic discharge stabilization. Preliminary operating characteristics of this chemical laser for the 3-µ rotational-vibrational transitions in HF and the 4-µ transitions in DF are presented."
"The development of transversely excited atmospheric pressure (TEA) CO2Lasers has led to the generation of multimegawatt laser pulses at 10.6 µm in simple laboratory prototypes. A discussion of the basic properties of these lasers is followed by the description of a number of different techniques that have been used to provide effective transverse excitation of lasers at low repetition rates. The basic technique used to increase the repetition rates to 1000 pulses per second (PPS) is described. Considering the simplicity of the technique and its low cost, it appears that in the not too distant future, pulse energies in the kilojoule region and pulse lengths of the order of one nanosecond will be practical."
"Measurements are presented of the electron energy distribution functions in CO2laser plasmas. Limitations of the diagnostic methods are discussed and their importance for the measurements is evaluated. The influence of the components of the laser mixture on the plasma characteristics is investigated; practically all distributions are found to be non-Maxwellian. The effect of the lasing action on the plasma is investigated with time-resolved probe and spectroscopic techniques. It is found that electron-electron interactions are insufficient to relax the distribution function during lasing. The modulation of electronically excited nitrogen levels indicates a strong coupling to the ground levels via the electron gas."
"A unique gas laser system suitable for achieving more than a 100-kW peak power in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral region near 1600 Å is described. First, the theory of the molecular hydrogen laser is presented. The novel operation of the device to generate a fast-rising current pulse which travels down the discharge channel at the velocity of light is described. Finally, the experimental verification of lasing and further characteristics of the device are given."
"The various laser output power waveforms which can be generated using a helium-neon vernier laser are described and their utilization in measuring plasma refractive indices is discussed. Utilizing the laser in the near degenerate configuration, a simple method is presented for determining the electron density of a CW plasma. Using the same configuration, fast current switching experiments are also described which are utilized to check this simple method and to obtain information about the gas density of the CW argon ion laser plasma investigated. Additional experiments utilizing the single-frequency configuration are discussed and its high sensitivity feature is compared with that of a conventional laser interferometer."

"Measurements in a propane-air flame show that the falloff of probe current following the application of a negative pulse to a spherical probe is approximately given by Ii=2π(ε0µene)1/2rpVpt-1/2where Ii=probe current, ε0=permitivity of free space, µ=ionic mobility, e= electronic charge, ne=electron density, rp=probe radius, Vp=amplitude of pulse,and t=time."

"Solving the quantum-kinetic equation for electrons interacting with deuterium molecules and a 1.8-eV photon field, we have made time-dependent calculations of the breakdown of deuterium gas by a ruby laser. We find that the quantum flux G corresponding to the breakdown threshold E field is given by an equation which is approximately of the form ln 44 = ln[δt/A(G/ω)] - B(ω/G)1/2where Δt and ω are the laser pulse length and frequency, and A and B are constants. The field strength thresholds which emerge from these calculations are compared with available experimental data, and good agreement is obtained."

"Measurements have been made with Gunn oscillators producing CW power in excess of 15 mW in two distinct frequency modes around 37 GHz and 30 GHz, respectively. The higher frequency mode is itself tunable with voltages between 2 and 4V, while the lower frequency mode is tunable with slightly higher voltages. In each of these modes the frequencies are extremely stable."
"A description is given of a novel digital phase and frequency-sensitive detector suitable for use in phase-locked loops operating over several octaves in frequency. When the loop is in balance neither the carrier nor its harmonics appear at the output of the detector. The error signal is large and independent of frequency difference when out of phase lock. The performance of the detector in a phase-locked loop operating over two decades of frequency is illustrated."

"The typical noble gas ion laser plasma consists of a high-current-density glow discharge in a noble gas, in the presence of a magnetic field. Typical CW plasma conditions are current densities of 100 to 2000 A/cm2, tube diameters of 1 to 10 mm, filling pressures of 0.1 to 1.0 torr, and an axial magnetic field of the order of 1000 G. Under these conditions the typical fractional ionization is about 2 percent and the electron temperature between 2 and 4 eV. Pulsed ion lasers typically use higher current densities and lower operating pressures. This paper discusses the properties of ion laser plasmas, in terms of both their external discharge parameters and their internal ion and excited state densities. The effect these properties have on laser operation is explained. Many interesting plasma effects, which are important in ion lasers, are given attention. Among these are discharge nonuniformity near tube constrictions, extremely high ion radial drift velocities, wall losses intermediate between ambipolar diffusion and free fall, gas pumping effects, and radiation trapping. The current status of ion laser technology is briefly reviewed."
"A motor that uses an electric field interaction with surface charges induced on the surface of a lossy dielectric rotor as the force mechanism is described. A theory of force generation and efficiency for a transverse-magnetic wave interaction with a moving conducting medium and a space-harmonic analysis of a practical circuit to carry such a wave are presented. A comparison is made between the results of this analysis and test results on a three-phase 60-Hz motor using a Bakelite or a Plexiglas rotor. Satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment is obtained in most respects. Motor operation was observed in both directions of rotation, as a result of interaction with the first backward space harmonic. Generator operation is also theoretically possible and the theory for a single-harmonic-wave generator is presented. Generator operation was not observed, however, in the device that was tested."
"How well can human faces be identified by humans and by computers, using subjectively judged \"feature\" descriptions like long ears, wide-set eyes, etc.? Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4×106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."
"This paper is completely tutorial in character and its sole objective is to provide the network-oriented reader with a clear and detailed presentation of the theoretical ideas underlying the insertion-loss approach to the approximation-synthesis problem of doubly resistor terminated filters. The treatment, which is leisurely and thorough, interleaves several key theorems in a systematic manner."
"Using the properties of the Möbius transformation, the most general conditions necessary for the transforming network can be found for the existence of the Q factor for a two-state one-port network. Other figures of merit can be found for two-state and one-state terminations with different classes of transforming networks."
"TRAPATT oscillations in a p-i-n diode were simulated by an approximate but fast computer model. A diode current composed of the first two harmonics of a half-wave rectified sine wave gave high-efficiency oscillations over a wide range of current levels and over several orders of magnitude of the diode saturation current."
"A simple FET based on a vertical channel configuration is proposed for use as a variable resistor. By tailoring the shape of the channel plan geometry, a large range of log-linear conductance variation may be achieved within a single device. The principle may be used to give other laws of conductance variation and could have application to FETs operating in the power range."
 "A traveling-wave negative resistance amplifier is proposed using a corrugated surface wave structure. A simple gain equation is derived based on a two-dimensional model. The proposed amplifier is simple to construct and is capable of high-power operation."
"Electron velocity measurements in n-InSb for the region beyond avalanche breakdown are reported and explained on the basis of optical phonon interaction with streaming electrons. In transverse fields, the velocity is independent of carrier density but diminishes as the square root of the applied magnetic field. For parallel fields, the velocity reduces as the square root of the carrier density."
"The dynamic behavior of a tunnel diode monostable trigger is analytically investigated. The output pulse shape, its width, and recovery time are computed using both the straight-line and power function approximations for the tunnel diode characteristic. It is found that the two results differ appreciably and the latter results are in good agreement with experimental observations."
"A sensitive millimeter wave receiver has been developed in which a single Gunn diode is employed both as local oscillator and mixer. The dynamic range can extend from well below 10 pW to well above 1 µW. Useful conversion gain is realized owing to the negative differential resistance of the device."
 "The use of a thin dielectric electron tunneling element along with basic conventional circuit elements is discussed. The circuits considered perform as a voltage-controlled capacitance switch, a voltage-controlled capacitance staircase generator, and a read only computer memory element."
"The characteristics of essentially zero standby power drain, reduced load capacitance, and lower supply voltage of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) digital circuit compared with a bipolar transistor circuit offer a potential advantage of 10 to 1000 times in power-speed product."

"This special issue of PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE highlights the educational process as appliteod a ll of our members. The role of the IEEE Group on Education is specifically directed to a continuing program for those IEEE members who have joined together to work constantly on the tasks that should be successfully performed if the educational process can bring knowledagne d understanding to all our members so that the Institute can be a positive influence in establishing a stable future. The scientific-engineering community must influence changeto which we all must adjust if we are to achieve a new balance between knowledge, experience, and action."
"Engineering education has been much studied during the past fifty years. One of the first major studies, known as the Wickenden Report in its trial version recommended that engineering education be at the graduate level. However, this was later amended to say that engineering education should be an undergraduate study, but should be followed by an internship in which one's further education would be guided by the engineering colleges, industry, and the engineering societies working together. The dilemma of engineering education has been that we have tried to combine a broad general education with some engineering in a sort of liberal science education, instead of offering professional education with a very strong technological stem. Since we have chosen the former path, we find ourselves confronted by other unresolved questions. Should we teach science or engineering practice? How much emphasis should there be on design and how much on theory and analysis? How broad should the curriculum be and how much of the humanities should it contain? How much should we depend on graduate work to train an engineer? Now in addition to these dilemmas we find ourselves confronted with the problem of finding sufficient time to cover the material considered necessary. It is obvious that many of our constraints, schedules, credits, fifty-minute periods, lectures, laboratories, and lock-step methods must be replaced by new methods and systems designed to teach more efficiently. This offers an opportunity for cooperation among industry, the colleges, and the professional societies."
"Engineering education as we know it is quite recent. Although engineers have been important for millenia, schools were not needed until the eighteenth century. Then France and Germany began to train engineers on the university level. In the early nineteenth century, the ideas and methods of those countries were introduced by the United States in institutes of technology. Soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, the German plans for technical education began to be grafted onto our literary universities, which had largely followed the English model. American activity was heightened by the Land Grant Act passed by Congress and signed by Lincoln in 1862. Specialization within engineering had led to a separation of mechanical engineering from \"civil\" soon after the development of the steam engine. Electrical engineers split from mechanical engineers in the late nineteenth century. College curricula appeared and the AIEE was organized. The concepts of electricity held by such men as Faraday, Henry, and Maxwell are traced through the centuries. Henry's telegraph was followed by lights, motors, and generators. After Thompson's discovery of electrons, the thermionic valve and the audion appeared. The IRE was formed, and the \"electronics\" options appeared in college curricula. Both World Wars led to growths of technology which were rapidly absorbed into peacetime developments. Expansion continues. The AIEE and the IRE merged into the IEEE, indicating an interdependence, and the undergraduate college curricula show the same unity of concept between electrical power and information systems. Postgraduate curricula, on the other hand, show continually greater specialization. For the future, a general culture will surely require education in science and its applications. We must continue to train the practitioners of engineering, and in addition we must help educate all serious students. This double responsibility lies before us."
"Electrical engineering is the largest branch of the U. S. engineering profession. Employment has been affected significantly by the growth in electronics since 1945, but electrical engineers are employed in a variety of industry groups. About 11 000 bachelor's degrees have been earned each year since 1959, and the number of master's and doctor's degrees has increased steadily practically every year. In the last few years, however, electrical engineering degrees have decreased slightly as a percentage of all engineering degrees. Statistical sources do not agree in definitions or criteria, and may therefore include varying percentages of nondegree holders in the total number of electrical engineers reported. There are about 270 000 people currently employed in the field according to the U. S. Department of Labor, with 10 000 to 12 500 new requirements each year. Although manufacturing industry will continue to employ the majority of electrical engineers, rapid growth is envisioned in business, professional, educational, and government services."
"The shift in national goals that this country has undergone in the past few years is described. Recommendations of how best to modify our engineering curricula to accommodate to these shifts are made. Finally some federal programs which encourage this shift in emphasis are described."
"The results of a study of parameters which can be used to evaluate the quantitative performance of engineering schools and departments are presented. A set of parameters which should be useful in measuring efficiency consists of the major outputs of the unit divided by either its budget or faculty size. Curves of the latter parameters versus time are presented for several example schools, along with the average figures based on the four annual Directories of Engineering College Research and Graduate Study. An efficient format for evaluating and monitoring these parameters and a discussion of their limitations are presented. To study the effect of size on various performance parameters, a computer program was used to calculate statistical averages for the schools in the 1970 Directory. For most parameters there is a distinct increase with size, but the large degree of scatter indicates that smaller schools can be efficient."
"A multioption (three) program in electrical engineering is proposed to meet the needs of a rapidly advancing technology and a wide range of student interests and objectives. A specific program is described which includes a wide range of technical electives outside of electrical engineering, and also features a novel treatment of advanced mathematics for electrical engineering students in both the systems and science areas. An integrated humanities-social sciences program is additionally described."
"Computer engineering is concerned with the organization, design, and utilization of digital processing systems. These may be general purpose computers or more specialized digital systems that are concerned with communications, control, information processing, etc. The rapidly expanding application areas for digital processing techniques require increasing numbers of properly trained engineers, and it is the responsibility of electrical engineering education to provide the necessary educational opportunities. A means for doing this is an undergraduate computer engineering option within electrical engineering. The curriculum for such an educational program would be both hardware and software oriented, as described."
"The nature, size, extent, and growth rate of modern electric power systems are discussed along with examples to illustrate the large number of concepts and techniques used and to indicate the variety of technological challenges faced by electric power systems engineers. The discussion then turns to the need for a variety of educational programs to cover the breadth required, to the qualifications for faculty members who staff these programs, and to the ways in which these programs should interact with the power industry. Finally, the electric power systems engineering education program at MIT is discussed in terms of faculity, students, course offerings, and research projects."
"The interface between electrical engineering and the life sciences has grown enormously over the past three decades, nearly keeping pace with the expanding disciplines themselves. In an era when one finds engineers applying automata theory to genetic control systems, coupled-oscillator theory to the growth of yeast or the synchronizing of circadian rhythms, control theory to the cardiovascular system, communication theory to sensory systems, and network theory to food chains, one is no longer justified in holding a stereotyped view of the \"Bio-Medical Engineer,\" or in providing a specialized education to correspond to that stereotype. It is proposed that the undergraduate education of a bioengineer should introduce him to the breadth of that interface along which he eventually must choose a niche. Thus early specialization, both in engineering and in the life sciences is undesirable."
"The philosophy, mechanics, and syllabus of a unified sophomore course in nonlinear electronic circuits are offered as a possible solution to the dilemma, long faced by teachers of electronic circuit theory, of a decreasing amount of time in which to present circuits containing an increasing variety of nonlinear electronic devices. The logic and feasibility of teaching the unified principles of nonlinear circuit analysis which are independent of the devices and their internal physical principles of operation, and which require no prerequisite other than elementary calculus, are illustrated with typical examples of various practical large signal electronic circuits actually taught in the course. The necessity to teach only a few fundamental unifying concepts and techniques, and the high motivational value of the proposed approach are shown to be the overriding factors which led-to-the success of this sophomore course at Purdue University."
"The content of the first of the two courses in electro-magnetic fields offered by the electrical engineering department at MIT to its juniors is summarized. The course deals with electroquasi-statics and magnetoquasistatics throughout, treating electrostatic and magnetostatic phenomena as special cases. This method of presentation allows the introduction of many more engineering examples into lecture demonstrations and homework than is possible in a treatment of statics followed by a treatment of the full dynamic equations, or by an overemphasis on static phenomena with only a belated discussion of quasistatic ideas. Details on several lecture demonstrations and examples are given, and it is shown how they are integrated into the \"flow\" of ideas. Further, our treatment of magnetization differs from the conventional one and the advantages of this treatment are discussed."
"An approach to teaching science and engineering that was developed to maximize a student's opportunity to gain physical insight into a subject without a corresponding laboratory is described. The approach is based on the principle that theory and experiment should receive approximately equal attention in the development of both the basic concepts and their most important applications. Experimental facts are introduced through a series of quantitative experiments which the lecturer performs as a part of his classroom development of concepts. The experiments also form a central part of the out-of-class learning experience of each student."
"Recent changes in the electrical engineering curriculum at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Brooklyn, N. Y., require every undergraduate to build up his skills, self-confidence, and independence by a graded laboratory program beginning with demonstrations and supervised exercises and terminating with an independent or group project. At the same time, each graduate student is offered an opportunity to take a graduate laboratory course consisting of all-day projects, under a teacher's supervision, easing his transition to independent research. By combining the two programs with respect to project work, the department has been able to generate considerable thrust and thereby secure grants and gifts for new equipment."
"Digital circuits are rapidly replacing analog circuits in many areas of electrical engineering. The undergraduate curriculum in electrical engineering has reflected these changes by including more course work in the digital area. The availability of low cost integrated circuit logic elements and minicomputers has made it possible to provide a digital system laboratory program that allows the student to undertake the design of realistic digital systems. This paper discusses the organization of such a laboratory program and the facilities needed to carry out this program."
"Typically, educational procedures emphasize the transmission of textbook content to the mind of the student. Many persons question the merit of this approach, and believe that a problem-oriented emphasis promises to be better. A four-year experience with problem-oriented approaches to electrical engineering undergraduate instruction is described. Here the learner searches for principles, concepts, facts, and techniques in solving a contiguous set of problems developed by the instructor. The monologue of the lecture is deemphasized in favor of dialogue in small groups. The learner uses all resources (texts, lectures, laboratory, computer, classmates, student advisors) to find his best solution to each problem, but ultimately he must justify his solution in a small group discussion. The experience described indicates that problem-oriented approaches can be simultaneously more effective and less expensive than the lecture approaches."
"Engineering education has been unduly influenced by attitudes more appropriate to the natural sciences. It should instead acknowledge the ultimate concern of the engineer for design rather than analysis, for systems rather than constituent components, and for value to the community in place of mere increase of knowledge. Advocacy of an engineering education which is consistent with engineering practice is supported by suggestions concerning curriculum structure, syllabus content, and educational methods."
"\"The Man-Made World\" is a secondary school course developed by the Engineering Concepts Curriculum Project (ECCP) with NSF support over the past five years. The goal is an introduction to technological literacy: an understanding of the concepts underlying modern technology in order to appreciate the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of that technology, especially as it interfaces with people and social institutions. The course has also been adapted for college offering."
"A college-level modification of the Engineering Concepts Curriculum Project (ECCP) course, \"The Man Made World,\" is described, and its use as a framework for a computer-communication based education system is suggested."
"The current interest of college students in helping to solve society's problems is attacked in two novel programs at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N. H. Both undergraduate and graduate engineering students are involved in teaching, learning, and working at off-campus sites for a term. One group is in Jersey City, N. J., where they help to teach the ECCP developed \"Man-Made World\" (MMW) to inner-city high school seniors while working for the city government. Another group is at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where they help to teach a novel freshman engineering course based on the MMW as well as attend regular classes. Results of the programs are discussed and future plans are indicated."
"A program operating at Stanford University, Stanford, Calif., in which minority group students who have succeeded in demonstrating high professional skills in their field of interest are admitted to the university with the direct objective of obtaining a master's degree is described. The basic design of the program is described under the following subheadings: initial evaluation of candiates; industrial participation; admission procedures; tutors and their responsibilities; operation and monitoring of the program."
"An overview of technical and economic factors which need to be considered in university ITV systems is presented. Cost data are presented which should be useful in planning and decision making. The data can be extrapolated for at least three to five years by adding about five percent per year to all costs."
"During the past four years several thousand professional employees of industries within a 60-mi radius of the Southern Methodist University (SMU) campus at Dallas, Tex., have participated fully as degree-seeking students in SMU's on-campus engineering graduate courses--without leaving their places of employment. The \"talkback TV\" system through which this is accomplished is described and evaluated from the standpoint of the students, the professor, the educational administrator, and the industrial employer. Inclusion of neighboring liberal arts colleges among course recipients and originators offers a further dimension of program enrichment at the undergraduate level."
"Research results obtained with the PLATO computer-based education systems, developed at the University of Illinois, indicate that computer technology can be effectively applied to some of the problems of our present educational system. The research results and system designs reported are based upon studies in computer-based education which have included over 150 000 student contact hours of credited instruction in a variety of subjects and educational levels. The discussions concerning computer-based instruction are divided into two major areas: first, the science of computer-based education and second, the engineering of computer-based education. Also included are a description of some new hardware developments which are necessary to the realization of an economically viable system, and a discussion of the economic and educational considerations which should influence the design of any computer-based education system."
"The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) On-Line System (OLS) provides a flexible and highly interactive vehicle for instruction in many engineering subjects, The system capabilities and instructional potential are discussed and illustrated by examples. Experience at UCSB over the past four years has shown that student motivation and comprehension are increased markedly by OLS use, and that this benefit extends to all class participants. The system is currently being used by sophomores and up, in subjects including complex variables, networks, controls, and hydrodynamics. The OLS is exportable to many IBM 360 systems, and the cost is within the means of most engineering departments."
"Several general approaches to the use of the digital computer in the teaching of engineering design are discussed. These approaches are 1) the use of existing programs, 2) the development of programs specifically designed to solve a certain type of problem, and 3) the development of general-purpose software packages designed to implement the material and techniques taught in a specific course. The advantages and disadvantages of these various approaches are discussed, and specific examples of each approach are given."
"A format of laboratory work consisting of \"minilabs\" and longer projects has been developed with attention to the student's concept of his educational objectives, Minilabs are short, weekly experiments intimately tied to the rest of the course, closer to homework problems than to conventional laboratory experiments. Reports are minimal. Undergraduates are used as instructors. The laboratory is open about eighty hours a week."
"The feedback shift register can be used as an educational tool in the study of many problems including: finite state machine properties, convolution, digital filtering, correlation, and sums of random variables. These applications are briefly described, it is argued that some of these concepts which have continuous analogs are better understood initially in discrete form."
"This article describes a student effort undertaken during the spring of 1970 at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, on the complete design of a minicomputer, the UHC-1. The computer is a 16-bit, 4K, microprogrammed machine with Teletype interface. In this short paper our attention is focussed on the effort as an educational experience rather than on the details of the design itself. An evaluation in terms of the educational benefits of the project is given."
"The laboratory portion of a graduate course in biomedical instrumentation is described. The experiments were not developed by the teacher, but rather by the students. Each student selected a topic, did outside reading, developed the experiment, and wrote up the procedure. During the second half of the semester each student ran all experiments developed by the other students, thus ensuring a commonality of experience. The brief description of the experiments given here may suggest ideas for other teachers in this specialty. There are advantages to student designed experiments. The teacher's work load is reduced during both the development and the write-up of the experiment. The student's interest is heightened by the design aspects of this open-ended situation. His output is examined by his peers, as well as by his teacher; thus increasing motivation. The format of student designed laboratory experiments may be useful in other courses where we desire to change the student's experience from passive following directions to more active participation in design."
"A unique electrical engineering laboratory course is described. This laboratory is an example of how industry can cooparate with universities in engineering education. The organization and operation of the course as well as the course material is outlined and explained, including the ways in which the industry participates in the operation of the laboratory. The educational benefits derived from such a cooperation between industry and the university are briefly detailed. These benefits are extended to the student, the University, the faculty, and the participating industry. This article provides the framework on which other laboratory experiences could be conceived and developed where industry and the university cooperate in the laboratory course."
"An undergraduate laboratory program in communications principles which is under development by two members of the faculty at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Ga., is described. The laboratory program is designed to illustrate basic principles without overwhelming the student with circuit and hardware problems. Equipment used centers around a \"communications simulator.\" The simulator, associated instrumentation, and the laboratory program are discussed."
"Several reasons for teaching integrated circuits from both a theoretical and a fabrication technology viewpoint are outlined. To illustrate a method whereby the goals of the student, university, and industry have been achieved, two theory and two laboratory courses have been developed and are described."
"A one semester course in coherent optics primarily for senior electrical engineering students is described. The need for such a course and a method of teaching it are discussed. Both lectures and demonstration experiments are suggested. A follow-on course for graduate students is also mentioned."
"An instructional-research laboratory in plasma phenomena, diagnostics, and applications which offers facilities for research and experimental training of graduate students and instructional opportunities for undergraduate students is described."
"The need for a rational approach to magnetics in the curriculum is discussed, and recommendations of acceptable pedagogic practices are given. Typical problems are indicated."
"An information retrieval system designed to provide instant on-demand access to a large educational program library is described. It includes references as to how the project evolved, the reasons behind it, details of the system, and some preliminary results. Some speculation on the future is projected."
"Washington University, St. Louis, Mo., has undertaken an interdisciplinary research and education program which is examining the potential and problems associated with the use of communications satellites for helping to meet educational needs in the United States. The program is examined in terms of its implications for engineering education. Emphasis is on program organization, student and faculty involvement, course content and methods, and the impact of such a program on the participants and the university."
"Samples of the Doppler spectrum of a 910-MHz signal propagated to a vehicle moving through a suburban mobile radio environment are presented. The multipath nature of the medium is evident in the data. The sharp limit to the width of the RF spectrum previously predicted analytically is demonstrated."
"A preemphasis technique is presented for an FM/FM system when the S band receiver discriminator is operating in the vicinity of threshold. The resultant transmitter deviations are quite different from those obtained with a standard 3/2 power taper and they conform more closely to minimum deviation requirements."
"The sign test is discussed in order to clarify the sense of its optimality and emphasize why it cannot be considered optimal for any commonly understood signal detection problem."
"Meteorological radar targets such as raindrops, refractivity perturbations, etc., are being studied using scattering angles other than 180° (back scattering). An analysis, analogous to that of Probert-Jones, yields a radar equation that is applicable, for a bistatic radar system, over all of space excluding the region near the line joining the two antennas."
"A mathematical approach is presented for the synthesis of the 12 trigonometric functions by infinite resolution potentiometers. (Infinite resolution potentiometers have continuous resistive tracks--generally uniformly thick--as compared to wire-wound potentiometers, which are of finite resolution in resistivity due to wire-to-wire discontinuities.) A tangent function synthesis is discussed as an illustration of the approach."
 "Comments are made on a recent paper by Hofman and Breitling on the rate of electromigration in thin films. It is shown that the simple concept of electron momentum transfer leads to a quadratic relation between the current density and rate of electromigration, in agreement with Black. Comments on the difficulty of relating this rate to failure times of metal conductors are also presented."
"A new type of beam waveguide is described which consists of a sequence of equispaced dielectric frames. This waveguide is derived from the Fabry-Perot open resonator with step rims along the edges of the mirrors. In comparison with the more common iris and lens beam waveguides, it presents advantages with respect to diffraction scattering and dissipation losses and in addition, is light-weight and compact. A model working at 35 GHz has been constructed and tested."
 "A method of underwater communication has been demonstrated in which a return-current-density field spreads over seawater in the vicinity of an insulated conductor connected to a pair of electrodes. This letter is concerned with the calculation of the current-density distribution."
"Experiments have been performed confirming the advantage of double cavity tuning of Gunn devices in the 35-GHz band. Output power improvements achieved were of 20-40 percent. The tunability of devices was over 5 GHz with output power above 5 mW. Maximum achievable frequency is with dual cavity about 7-8 percent lower than with the simple basic device."
"Resonant regenerative amplification of a CW signal at 28 µm in the pulsed H2O laser was obtained. The results indicate that pulse-to-pulse coherence in frequency is achieved at a power gain of ∼104. The experiments show that the polarization of the driving and driven signal need not be parallel."
"A method of locating defective elements in any planar array is described. The method consists of sampling the near radiated field over a plane parallel to the array and reconstructing the aperture field by applying an inverse diffraction transformation. Comparison with the known correct aperture field locates the defective elements. Some numerical results are presented."
"Upon the application of a high power density to a thin epitaxial layer, the transient flow of heat from the layer into a substrate of the same material has been calculated. The results have been normalized so as to apply to different materials, temperatures, and layer thicknesses."
"Due to velocity saturation of the carriers, the series resistance caused by the unswept layer in avalanche transit time diodes increases with increasing ac voltage on the diode. In GE npp+diodes this effect is found to influence the efficiency considerably and the same may be true for Si npp+diodes."
"The possibility is discussed of locating miners, after a disaster, by an electromagnetic technique. Specifically, it is suggested that the complex ratio of the horizontal and the vertical field components be measured. The limitation due to the finite conductivity of the overburden is also considered and shown to be a not insurmountable problem."
 "The ratio corrections arising from internal admittance loading of a ten-section inductive voltage divider (decade transformer) of the usual type are derived, with a clarification in the assignment of admittance values in the equivalent circuit. The corrections due to ground admittances are also derived."
"A systematic method for the enumeration of all the directed trees of a graph is presented. A large memory is not required for implementation of the method on a computer. The algorithm employs a new matrix termed \"branch-chord incidence matrix\" and a number system in which the radix is varied for each digit."
"Using the dispersion relation previously developed by these authors, and suitable boundary conditions, the small-signal impedance of the avalanche region in an IMPATT diode is derived. In this derivation unequal, but constant, hole and electron velocities and ionization coefficients are assumed. The impedance is derived for the case of infinite multiplication and is plotted for both Si and GaAs diodes. The effects of the drift regions are not included."
"Planar-type Gunn diodes of various dimensions were fabricated and their pulse response was experimentally investigated. A delay time of 0.06 ns and a power-delay product of 20 pJ were attained by reducing the length of the active region."

"Metal-oxide-semiconductor first effect transistors (MOSFETs) are currently being used in a variety of memory applications. The requirements of memory usage and the characteristics of MOSFET devices and technology have led to a number of unique circuits for these applications. Organization and design considerations of memory systems using MOSFET devices are reviewed, and examples of specific circuits are presented and analyzed. These include random access cells, shift registers, read only storage, and on-chip support circuits; both complementary and noncomplementary circuits are discussed."
"A short length of transmission line can be chosen as a basic circuit element. Systems containing such elements can then be synthesized to do an amazing number of things. For example, commensurate lines, all multiples of a given length with differing characteristic impedances but with common propagation constant, can be interconnected to realize microwave filters, broad-band transformers, broad-band delay lines with amplitude selectivity, and distributed RC structures. The fundamental ideas underlying the synthesis of commensurate transmission line circuits are presented in this paper in a tutorial fashion. The presentation is based on the scattering formalism and Richard's Theorem. The discussion is liberally sprinkled with design illustrations chosen from current practice."
"A novel type of spark transmitter using a circular arrangement of capacitors alternating with spark gaps was described previously. (K. Landecker and K. S. Imrie, \"A novel type of high power pulse transmitter,\" Aust. J. Phys., vol. 13, 1960, pp. 638-654.) The circular array was arranged such that it formed an oscillating magnetic dipole radiating RF power directly without the use of additional radiating elements. It has now become possible to achieve the same result with the aid of a single-spark gap either by incorporating distributed circuit elements, essentially half-wave transmission lines acting as 1 to -1 transformers, into the arrangement, or by assembling the array of tightly coupled individual tuned circuits having a common single-spark gap. It is shown that the latter arrangement is superior to the use of distributed circuit elements. This results in a very great simplification of the design because the question of synchronization of a multiplicity of spark gaps does not arise. It is finally shown that the capacitors distributed equidistantly around the circumference of the transmitter may advantageously be replaced by one single ring-shaped capacitor."
"An overview is given of current applications of computers to traffic control. It includes a discussion of types of hardware and control strategies used in computerized systems developed for the control of urban street networks, as well as critical traffic links such as freeways and tunnels. Some remarks are made concerning possible future development in the use of computers for better management of traffic facilities."
"Electrical switching in solids has been observed in semiconductors and insulators and often controversy has appeared in the literature over the interpretation of such events. The major reason for the disagreements is the complexity of the switching events, involving a number of separate steps, with possibly different mechanisms at these steps. General properties which are common to most switching events are discussed. Events are shown to start a) by an initiating step increasing the electrical conductivity, followed by b) the current runaway step due to instability, c) the voltage collapse step including the discharge of stored electrostatic energy, and d) the settling-down step with establishment of a low-voltage steady state. The usual mechanisms for initiation are thermal, or electronic. Thermally initiated events continue to develop by thermal effects. Thermal effects may govern also the continuation of the development of electronically initiated events. The influence of the thermal effects will be discussed in detail, emphasizing that the interpretation of a switching process requires the investigation of each switching step separately."
"A new waveguide, called \"fence guide,\" for millimeter-wave circuitry on a dielectric substrate is described. The structure of the guide, the field distribution, and its characteristics are considered."
"A simple electronic model which simulates the behavior of a visual cell is described. And the experiment of lateral inhibitory action of the cell models is shown."
"Amplitude modulation using micropower transistors is often required for many applications in communications and instrumentation. A micropower current-gain block with its hFEstabilized over several ICdecades can be used with additional circuitry for this purpose. This letter describes such a modulator and its operating characteristics."
"An extension to the small-signal analysis of Kino and Robson indicates that domain velocity in thin Gunn diodes decreases as diode thickness decreases or as surface dielectric loading increases."
"Various existing definitions for the selectivity of null networks are shown to be equivalent at the rejection frequency for general transfer functions with a pair of imaginary zeros. For the important second-order transfer function, the rates of cutoff at the half-power frequencies are also compatible."
"The sampled complex envelope of a waveform may be approximated by using linear combinations of two or more successive real samples as complex samples. Simple algorithms are adequate in the case of bandwidths up to about 50 percent. In certain signal processing applications the use of such algorithms permits a reduction in costs by eliminating demodulators."
"The I-V characteristics of some GaAs Schottky-barrier IMPATT diodes are found to be nearly ideal at operating temperatures (∼200°C). Fabricated on epitaxial n-type substrate with platinum contacts, the diodes use a truncated cone shape to avoid soft breakdown. The breakdown voltage and its temperature dependence are close to calculated values for one-sided abrupt junctions."
 "Experiments with low bulk loss liquid guides indicate that scattering losses can be attributed to the glass substrates. Order-of-magnitude computations point to trapped air as the source of scatter."
"The design of a recently reported high-Q distributed-lumped-active (DLA) network is discussed under the condition of zero real-part pole sensitivity, and complete information required for design is provided in graphical form."
"A degenerate parametric amplifier for 46 GHz is described. It uses a Schottky barrier varactor packaged in a modified Sharpless wafer. The novel amplifier mount construction, which uses no tuning screws, yields predictable and reproducible results. In good agreement with theory, 14-mW pump power was required and a noise temperature of less than 400°K was measured."
"A transformer-driven electrooptic Q-switching technique and associated circuit are described which eliminate the requirement to switch high voltages and which greatly simplify circuitry. It is shown that this technique provides remarkably good lasing efficiency even when the transformer risetime is twice as slow as the laser pulse buildup time."
"Previous pulsed low-noise measurements of avalanche oscillators have now been extended to CW devices having GaAs vapor-grown p-n junctions. The best AM noise-to-signal ratio observed was -140 dB, which is about 15 dB better than previously measured for GaAs avalanche diode oscillators."
 "Using a gas plasma as a source of free electrons, a brightness of 60 fL is obtained from an extended layer of ZnO phosphor with about 5 V applied to it. The phosphor efficiency, >10 lm/W, shows little change during 5000 h of operation. For display purposes devices have been constructed incorporating multiple phosphor-coated anodes whose potentials are controlled by low-voltage semiconductor circuits."
"A method of solution for radiation from a flanged waveguide is described. The problem is formulated using generalized mode matching technique [1], appropriate for geometries that include open regions. The resultant equation is solved using an extended version of the Modified Residue Calculus Technique originally developed for application to closed region problems. This technique has several advantages, among which is its numerical efficiency. Some numerical results are included and compared with those reported by others."
"A generalization of the transmission line quarter-wave impedance matching transformer is presented. The resultant series-section transformer can match complex as well as pure resistance loads to a transmission line, and the choice of the characteristic impedance of the matching section is not restricted to a single value."
"The maximum charge stored in the thin oxide metal-nitride-oxide-silicon (MNOS) memory transistor is calculated using a previously developed theory for the oxide current and experimental values for the nitride currents. The calculation is performed for oxide thicknesses of 15-50 Å and for six different nitride deposition temperatures. The theoretical results are shown to agree with recently published experimental data."

"Microwave avalanche diodes of various types (IMPATT, TRAPATT, etc.) can generate power sufficient for microwave receivers and some transmitters. This brief review summarizes mechanisms of operation, power output, efficiency, noise, and some important features of design and fabrication."
"Transferred electron amplifiers and oscillators are now well established as important members of the family of active microwave solid-state devices. The combination of power output, gain-bandwidth product, and noise figure that has been achieved with stable linear transferred electron amplifiers cannot be matched by any other type of microwave solid-state amplifier. Transferred electron oscillators have produced the highest power output obtained so far from a single solid-state device at microwave frequencies, they can be electronically and mechanically tuned over larger frequency ranges than other types of solid-state oscillators, and well designed transferred electron oscillators have exceptionally low AM and FM noise. An introductory survey of the history and the current status of the theory, technology, and application of transferred electron devices is presented. The future outlook for these devices appears bright."
"Microwave transistors are useful as small-signal amplifiers to 6 GHz and power amplifiers to 4 GHz. Nearly all microwave transistors are of the silicon planar type. Power transistors use three types of geometries--interdigitated, overlay, and mesh--while small-signal transistors use interdigitated only. The general theory of the frequency response of transistors is reviewed, including active and inactive elements. A condensed description of the design and processing steps for a silicon microwave transistor is given. A final section deals with the types of high-frequency measurements used in the design and analysis of transistors."

Different approaches to improve the power-handling capability of Schottky diodes at S-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies are considered."
"The use of semiconductor bulk phenomena in implementing microwave control components is reviewed. The principal phenomena explored to date have been the dielectric and conductive properties of the plasma state. A brief discussion of these properties is presented to identify their potentially useful characteristics for microwave control. It is noted that to date only the conductive plasma properties have proved practical for application. More specifically, electron-hole plasmas, generated by impact ionization or by contact injection, existing in silicon have been successfully incorporated in microwave circuitry to yield control components with substantially improved performance over junction devices. Examples of the design, fabrication, and results obtained for bulk semiconductor control components are presented illustrating the application of impact ionization to limiter and duplexer operation and contact injection utilizing a window configuration to switching and phase shifting operation. The principal improvements are gained through achieving at least an order of magnitude increase in power handling and full guide bandwidth in utilizing the window. In addition, it is noted that the bulk approach is virtually the only practical semiconductor approach for millimeter wave control components."

Propagation and radiation characteristics of microstrip lines are discussed. Design equations for thin-film lumped-element passive components are given. Exampies of various microwave integrated circuits are shown."
"Schottky-barrier GaAs IMPATT diodes have been fabrirated in a double epitaxial layer structure on low-etch-pit density substrates. The resulting low defect density in the active region permits high power outputs and low noise measure. Mounted on copper studs and a 20°C heat sink, such diodes have given a maximum CW power output of 2.94 W at 6.1 GHz with 13.8 percent efficiency. The small-signal amplifier noise measure was 25dB. Operated as injection-locked oscillators, the noise measure was 32 dB at an output of 1 W. These results show that in a suitable structure, GaAs can surpass the efficiency and noise performance of other materials, and demonstrate the capability of high power output in this frequency band."
"A novel harmonic-extraction method for operation of high-efficiency avalanche diodes has been demonstrated. It has been shown that high-efficiency power output can be obtained not only at the trapped-plasma frequency, but also at harmonic frequencies with respect to the trapped-plasma frequency. Second-harmonic powers of 110 W at 2.67 GHz with 22-percent efficiency from L-band diodes, and 64 W at 4.85 GHz with 15-percent efficiency from S-band diodes have been obtained. Third-harmonic extraction has extended the power output into the lower X-band frequency. Microstrip circuits for harmonic-extraction have been developed and analyzed. The circuit impedance requirements at the diode terminals have been computed. The circuit has been discussed in terms of a multiple-reflection triggering process. Useful information for circuit design has been deduced from a series of harmonic-extraction experiments. The voltage waveforms have been measured and have shown evidence of harmonic extraction and its association with the trapped plasma mode."
"A detailed experimental comparison between double-drift-region (DDR) and single-drift-region (SDR) millimeter-wave avalanche diodes is presented. For 50-GHz CW operation, DDR diodes have given a maximum of 1-W output power compared to 0.53 W for the SDR diodes, while maximum efficiencies of 14.2 percent for the DDR and 10.3 percent for the SDR diodes have been obtained. These results are in agreement with the theory of Scharfetter et al. [1] for DDR IMPATT diodes. Both the DDR and SDR diode measurements were made on room temperature, metal heat sinks. The DDR diodes were shown to operate at significantly lower junction temperatures for the same value of output power, indicating a potential reliability advantage. Ion implantation was used to make the p drift region of the p+p-n-n+50-GHz DDR devices. Otherwise the fabrication (which includes diffusion and epitaxial technologies) and the microwave measurement methods were identical for both types of diodes. Capacitance measurements were compared with calculations to determine the desired doping concentrations for frequencies from 43 to 110 GHz. Experimental results for the higher frequency millimeter-wave region have been obtained on DDR structures with both p and n drift regions implanted. At 92 GHz an output power of 0.18 W and an efficiency of 7.4 percent have been obtained."
"The transferred electron effect in epitaxial GaAs has been used to realize a semiconductor device which exhibits a stable negative conductance over a wide range of microwave frequencies and power levels. These devices have been used in conjunction with circulator coupled networks to design high-level wide-band transferred electron amplifiers which have a voltage gain bandwidth product in excess of 10 GHz for frequencies from 4.0 to about 16.0 GHz. Linear gains of 6-12 dB per stage and saturated output power levels in excess of ½ W have been realized. The physical and electrical properties of these devices are described with regard to the achievement of a stable negative conductance. The influence of several parameters (i.e., device temperature, bias voltage, circuit loading, etc.) is discussed with regard to device and circuit stability. Measurements of the terminal admittance of several typical devices as a function of the bias, input power, and frequency have been used to study their microwave properties. The large signal data are used to compute the relationship between the available device power and the magnitude of the negative conductance independent of the test circuit. This same measurement technique can provide a simulation of the performance of any nonlinear negative conductance, without the need for circuit design and load tuning. In addition, an analytical large signal model of the negative conductance has been used to predict the large signal performance of the active device (i.e., gain compression, conversion efficiency, etc.) in both oscillator and amplifier circuits."

This technique consists of etching part of the epitaxial gallium arsenide layer from beneath the edge of the source and drain contacts and using the resulting overhang as an evaporation mask for the gate contact metal. Microwave measurements were made on a device fabricated in this manner with a 4-µ gate length. Maximum available gain measurements yield 16 dB at 2 GHz falling off at 6 dB/octave to a cutoff frequency of 11 GHz."
"The avalanche region of one-sided and two-sided abrupt junctions has been studied. These are the structures most commonly utilized for IMPATT diodes. Numerical results are presented which show that n+-p Si diodes have much narrower avalanche regions, due to the unequal ionization rates in Si, than the complementary p+-n type. The implications of these results with respect to IMPATT diode design are discussed."
"The purpose of this letter is to show that almost all microwave oscillations seen in GaAs, at all frequencies, can be completely accounted for by accumulation layer mode (LSA) operation of the device and therefore only dependent on the current peak-to-valley ratio and the circuit characteristics.

 "Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are properly to be regarded as a class of sampled control systems; they can be treated as continuous systems when the control range and all perturbation frequencies of interest are much smaller than the sampling rate. Thus in the general case, PLLs must be analyzed by the Laplace transform for sequences (\"z transform\") rather than for continuous signals. Stability limits are presented for some sampled PLLs of practical importance, and the methods of analysis are compared critically with a common approach."

Imaginary parts of roots are found in a similar manner after using some polynomial manipulations to convert imaginary parts of the roots of the original polynomial to real parts in a new polynomial. Real and imaginary parts can then be paired. Experimental results indicate that the method is competitive with several common algorithms on both the accuracy and the computation time basis."

This is demonstrated by considering the problem of diffraction by a strip grating on a dielectric slab and it is shown that the phenomenon of relative convergence [1],[2] occurs in the process of solution; that is, for a given numerical approximation of the kernel of the integral equation the most accurate solution is obtained for an optimum size, and not for the largest size of the matrix.

"A speech signal was passed through a cascade of identical delta modulators. Signal degradation (as a function of the number of delta modulations I) was initially more rapid when the delta modulation was adaptive (ADM) than if it was linear (LDM). However, the rate of degradation was nearly constant in LDM, while for ADM it decreased monotonically with I (as in PCM); and at I=6, the ADM still maintained a significant SNR advantage."

"Experiments are described in which optical images of small metallic objects were reconstructed from millimeter wave phasigrams (phase-only holograms). Since the well-established term HOLOGRAM introduced first by Gabor implies a \"total record,\" namely of amplitude and phase, the term phase-only hologram would be contradictory. The authors propose the term PHASIGRAM for a \"phase record\" based on the Greek work \"phasis\" for phase. Sufficient resolution is present in the images obtained to allow the identification of a toy metallic gun, even when covered with a layer of clothing or synthetic leather. The phase distribution of the 70-GHz millimeter wave field scattered by the object was determined by mechanically scanning a harmonic mixer over a 0.75-m diameter circular aperture in a spiral pattern. The resulting electrical phase signal was converted to a light intensity pattern which was recorded on photographic film. A He-Ne laser was used to illuminate a reduced transparency replica of the recorded phasigrams and reconstruct the images."

"The rapid development of the microelectronics industry over the last decade has placed exceptional demands on thin-film technology since, to a large extent, it controls the technological pace of that industry. This demand has challenged the thin-film technologist to develop new and improved processes for both thin-film devices as well as for the thin-film conductors and insulation needed by semiconductor devices. The projected demands of the coming decade will require advances in the technology comparable to those of the past decade if the full potential of large scale integration is to be achieved. The variety of materials and processes required to meet adequately the total needs of the industry has necessitated the development of several deposition technologies. Vacuum evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, sedimentation, etc., are all in volume manufacturing use and the technologies of each of these techniques has been significantly improved during the past ten years. A similar increase in process capability and control has been necessary in the area of pattern definition in order to allow the development of fine line etching which achieves the required narrow linewidths and separations in today's microelectronic assemblies. The materials of major interest to the industry as well as the deposition techniques and photoengraving processes used in their processing are highlighted. The discussion includes the status and limitations of the technology as it exists today as well as a consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of the various processes both as of today and for the future."
"Recent advances in the manufacture of complex bipolar integrated circuits have led to a variety of techniques for metal interconnection on the chip. As the need for more and more devices has increased chip size, the problem of random defects has become catastrophic. Functional yields are often seen to drastically decrease or even vanish with attempts to fabricate very large bipolar parts. Since the major factor determining die size is the metal interconnect size and spacing, one way to conserve \"real estate\" while achieving highly complex circuits is to employ more than a single layer of interconnection metal. At present both double- and triple-layer schemes are being used. These multilayer metallizations, while solving the problem of chip defects, are not without serious drawbacks of their own. These problems are discussed. The Motorola multilayer systems considered are all aluminum based; i.e., pure aluminum or lightly doped aluminum. Although other metals are being experimented with, aluminum systems make up nearly all of the commercially available ICs at this time. In general, these metal layers are insulated from one another by a deposited dielectric, usually SiO2. The most prominent yield limiting problems are discussed. These include coverage of both metal edges and oxide steps with additional metal and/or another layer of oxide. Processing parameters such as profiles, thickness, temperature, composition, etc., that influence coverage are discussed as well as innovations for improving less-than-desirable results."
"Some fundamental aspects of electromigration phenomena as they have been studied in \"bulk\" metallic conductors are reviewed. In an electric field atoms are subjected to a force due to the field, and to a force which results from the motion of electrical carriers, electrons, or holes. In bulk samples, and at high temperatures, these forces cause the displacement of atoms by a lattice mechanism which is also responsible for the diffusion of atoms in a concentration gradient. In thin films, electromigration has been found to occur at lower temperatures (and higher current densities) by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism. Electromigration may cause failures at material discontinuities, such as found at terminals, at temperature gradients, or at structural inhomogeneities. The process of crack formation, as observed in aluminum thin films, is described. Failure times are a function of the activation energy for diffusion and of exponents of the current density which vary for different failure modes. The effects of film purity, orientation, grain size, glass overcoat, and solute additions on lifetime are reviewed. Practical guidelines for the design of thin-film interconnections, and for the interpretation of accelerated test data are given."
"The resistance of a thin film resistor can be considered as consisting of three parts: 1) the resistance of the resistor material, 2) the resistance of the termination material, and 3) the interfacial resistance. The aging of the interfacial resistance can dominate the aging of low valued resistors, especially under corrosive conditions. The interfacial resistance using a distributed parameter analysis is treated and a figure of merit which can be used to describe the aging of the interface is defined. Also, a sensitive method of measuring this quantity is introduced and a sampling of data on several different termination material systems is presented. The best results were obtained with Ti-Pd-Au. The conclusions drawn from the figure of merit are corroborated by adhesion and thermocompression bond strength studies."
"Thin-film resistors are useful in monolithic integrated circuits whenever high sheet resistance (ρs> 1 kΩ/sq) or radiation hardness are required. Silicide resistive films (MoSi2, CrSi2, and Si-Cr) deposited by dc sputtering have been shown to be compatible with monolithic circuit production end require no protective overlayer. Si-Cr films 200-300 Å thick have ρs, and temperature coefficients of resistance (TCR) ranging from about 1 kΩ/sq and +150 ppm/°C (CrSi2) to 20 kΩ/sq and -1400 ppm/°C (17 at % Cr). MoSi2is best suited for resistor applications requiring 100-200Ω/sq. MoSi2films are about 700 Å thick at 200 Ω/sq, compared to < 100 Å for 200-Ω/sq Ni-Cr, and their TCR is -125 ppm/°C. Typical stability for unprotected silicide resistors in TO-5 packages at 200°C, no load, is < ±3 percent during the first 200 h and < ± 0.5 percent during the next 2000 h. The films are stable during short term exposure to high temperatures as encountered during monolithic or hybrid circuit ceramic package sealing."
"Some of the various uses of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) as applied to thin film studies on semiconductor devices are illustrated. Examples presented include the use of the SEM to measure thickness variations in an aluminum film, to determine evaporation coverage of aluminum films over oxide steps, to locate θ phase (CuAl2) particles in an Al-2% Cu thin film, to determine crystallographic orientation using Coates-Kikuchi patterns, to find an open circuit in a nichrome resistor, to follow the fuse blowout of an aluminum stripe, and to determine the chemical composition of thin films. In these examples, the secondary backscatter electron beam induced current (EBIC), voltage contrast, and X-ray modes are demonstrated as well as the rapid scan technique."
"In microelectronic applications, various approaches have been used to provide high capacitance thin film components. None of these has been widely accepted for reasons that are both technical and economic. Limited applications have been made of silicon and other simple oxides, e.g., of aluminum or tantalum, as dielectric media. Particularly in the area of microwave integrated circuits, requirements for high frequency, high specific capacitance, low to moderate loss, and integrability call for new thin film approaches. These requirements will only be met by using more complex compounds, possibly of ferroelectric materials. Aspects of material preparation, composition evaluation, and dielectric performance of thin film bismuth titanates are treated in a manner which should be of value in considering other complex dielectrics for similar use. Of particular technological importance is the use of thin silica barrier layers at the metal electrodes to permit achieving low dielectric loss."
"Results of a study on the deposition of thin-film barium titanate (BaTiO3) by RF sputtering are discussed. BaTiO3was deposited onto Pt foil and onto thin-film electrodes on various substrates, and counterelectroded to form metal-dielectrio-metal structures. Dielectrics were deposited at substrate temperatures from 23° to 1000°C, some of the dielectrics fired in air at temperatures up to 1400°C after deposition. On bulk Pt, the BaTiO3film matrix indicated an average grain size of 2000 Å after heat treatment Constant Ba/Ti ratios were measured for the films deposited over the entire substrate temperature range. Dielectric constants ranged from 16- 1900, the tan δ of the capacitors varying from 0.005 for amorphous films to 0.065 for polycrystalline films with highest dielectric constants. Effects of temperature and frequency on the capacitors and the charge-voltage and field dependence of the dielectric constant are described. Current-voltage relationships, breakdown strengths, and processing conditions indicate the potential of the capacitor structures for practical applications."
"How thick-film systems are used in all facets of today's electronic industry, starting with their initial application in the computer and defense industries, is described. As the state of the art grew, composition suppliers broadened their lines, developing new higher performance materials to meet changing and more sophisticated packaging requirements. The present technology offers advantages of simple processing, fast and inexpensive tooling systems, economy, quick tumaround time between need and prototype, using wider tolerance active devices, high reliability, and multilevel circuit capabilities. As a result, virtually all sectors of today's electrical and electronics industries are turning to solid-state systems which utilize thick-film hybrid microcircuitry. Consumer and automotive electronic uses are exhibiting the highest rate of new thick-film circuitry adoption at the present time. Industrial usage for high power, measuring and control systems, is also increasing rapidly, and thick-film hybrid circuits are strong candidates to replace electromechanical switching devices. The use of. hybrid microcircuits is forecasted to double or triple current usage on a worldwide basis by 1975. In the future, thick films are expected to play an ever increasing role in the packaging of semicpnductor devices because of their low production cost and high performance advantages."
"Ceramic formulations set in an organic binder are currently being cast in thin paper-like sheets. These sheets may be punched, screened with metal pastes, and laminated to form a composite of metal and ceramic particles held together by an organic medium. By slowly burning off the organic binder and then sintering the ceramic and metal together, a substrate with many layers of interconnecting wiring may be obtained. The coincident sintering of the ceramic and metal phases presents compatibility constraints. Temperature considerations with respect to shrinkage and coefficient of expansion match between the ceramic and metal phases as well as solid/solid and solid/ambient interactions are important constraints in the fabrication of these composites. High conductivity metals (e.g., Ag, Cu) are generally not available for co-firing because sintering temperatures of important ceramic formulations are higher than the melting points of these metals. This constraint has been minimized through the use of capillary infiltration of molten metals into the ceramic structure. Consequently, it is now possible for multilayer ceramic structures to provide the interconnection wiring densities and conductivities necessary to respond to the needs of greater circuit densities of integrated circuit chips. Material selections are reviewed on the basis of electrical properties, ambient interactions, stresses due to sintering shrinkage, and thermal coefficient of expansion. Certain problems, tradeoffs, and procedures used in the fabrication of a multilayer substrate with Cu-filtrated lines are discussed."
"An investigation was made into the occurrence of substrate surface defects, such as surface pits, low-density regions and burrs, and their effect on fine-line thin-film conductor patterns fabricated on the substrate. Substrate surface quality was characterized through examination of fine-line thin-film test patterns (50-µm lines on 100-µm centers). The results of these observations are summarized in terms of N-, the substrate surface defect density, and f, the frequency of resultant conductor-line imperfections greater in width than some critical size δ. The parameter f is directly related to the expected yield Y for a thin-film interconnect circuit with fine-line conductor length L. A quantitative model is developed which accurately relates N and f to N-(x), the size distribution of surface voids; δ, the critical extent of defect overlap on a conductor line; and D, the width of the conductor line. Application of the model to prediction of the dependence of f and Y on various parameters led to the conclusion that it is important to establish objective criteria as to what constitutes a conductor-line imperfection. A change in definition from the extent to which a conductor line appeared to be open to the overlap of a substrate defect on a conductor line resulted in a tenfold increase in f. This change would result in a fourfold decrease in Y for the case of an interconnect pattern with 500 cm of 50-µm lines. A change in δ from D/3 to 2D/3 resulted in a sixfold decrease in f and a corresponding increase in yield from 20 to 80 percent for the same interconnect circuit."
"The factors which can influence the performance and reliability of the interconnection system for solid-state components in hybrid integrated circuits are examined. The main emphasis is on materials that have received most attention in the tantalum film and silicon technologies in the Bell System. However, other materials that are being used are discussed. The interrelation of various factors in choosing an interconnection system is discussed. These factors include the composition of the materials, the methods of depositing various metals, and the properties of the substrates. Among the properties of the materials that are considered, emphasis is laid on environmental stability. The results of environmental tests on conductors and thin-film resistors under high-humidity conditions are reported. Some results on the use of silicone rubber as an encapsulant indicate this material is effective in reducing degradative action on hybrid circuits."
"Magnetic films are used in the information processing area in two principal applications: random access high speed memory and serial access lower speed memory. The application requirements for magnetic films of these two types, the material properties needed to meet these requirements, and the metallurgical structures which give rise to the properties are described. The directions of present development work and of possible future improvements in the technology are discussed."
"A review of the material technology for microwave integrated circuits (MICs) is presented. The types of microwave circuit media that have been used are described and classified as a function of the amount of size reduction or integration which corresponds to the effective dielectric constant of the media. The materials used for substrates, conductors, dielectrics, and resistors are considered in terms of the requirements for microwave circuits. The fabrication of multilayered thin-film circuits and the various thin-film combinations that have been used in MICs are discussed. The various loss contributions for microstrip circuits produced by thin- and thick-film technology and substrate material are compared with each other as a function of frequency. It is concluded that microwave circuits operating at frequencies 2 GHz and above require thin-films on pure smooth substrates."
"The introduction of electron emitters utilizing negative electron affinity has greatly improved the performance of many conventional light-sensing devices. The unique properties of such emitters have also made possible devices which were heretofore not feasible. Since their arrival as laboratory curiosities about five years ago, these emitters have had a large impact in the area of low-light-level detection, particularly scintillation counting. Recent advances in materials technology and surface activation processes have brought negative electron affinity photocathodes to the market place for use as detectors for both the Nd and GaAs lasers. In both cases, the detectors are more than an order of magntiude more sensitive to the laser light than previous photocathodes, and the dark currents (thermionic emission from the cathodes which can be limiting in low-light-level use) are several orders of magnitude less. Several other applications of negative electron affinity are presently under development which may further affect photocathodes, photomultipliers, imaging devices, and even the time-honored thermionic cathode. The operating principles of this type of electron emitter, the present state of the art and its effect on device performance, and the possible developments in the near future are discussed."
"The most promising electroluminescent materials used for visible light emitting diodes (LEDs) are GaAsP, GaAlAs, GaP, and GaAs with phosphors. Presently, GaAsP, which is prepared by vapor phase epitaxy, is the only material which has found widespread commercial use. In this work an effort was made to explore the feasibility of fabricating planar monolithic GaAlAs LED arrays prepared by the liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) process. In order to accomplish this objective the LPE process was developed so that epitaxial layers of uniform thickness and essentially constant composition with smooth photoprocessable surfaces could be reproducibly grown at a reasonable cost. Through the use of special fixturing and proper adjustment of thermal gradients during the LPE growth, epitaxial layers of suitable quality were produced which were used to fabricate planar monolithic structures. A description will be given the preparation and processing of these structures. The electrical properties of the GaAlAs epitaxial layers and the electrical and optical characteristics of the planar monolithic structures fabricated will be discussed. The LPE process which has evolved in the growth of GaAlAs layers also has applicability for the LPE growth of GaP or amphoteric doped GaAs both of which have produced high efficiency LEDs so far by the LPE process only."
"The Müller technique of flash evaporating powdered compound semiconductors was used to form polycrystalline thin-film solid solutions of CdSe-CdS and CdSe-CdTe onto heated glass substrates. The composition of each alloy was varied from 10 to 90 percent of one compound by weight. X-ray diffractometer was used to determine their crystalline structures and lattice parameters. The results show that all CdSe-CdS alloys have a hexagonal structure regardless of their composition and that CdSe-CdTe alloys have both cubic and hexagonal structures depending on the composition of the constituent compounds. The lattice parameters were found to vary linearly with the composition for each alloy. Electrical properties of these thin-film alloys in terms of Hall mobility and carrier concentration were determined at room temperature as a function of substrate temperature which ranged from 50°C to 200°C. The results indicate that the film properties depend heavily on the preparation conditions, such as evaporation rate, vacuum pressure, and substrate temperature. The latter factor appeared to have dominated their properties to a great extent. Films prepared at higher substrate temperatures tended to have both low carrier mobility and concentration. All films, however, show an n-type conduction regardless of their composition and preparation conditions. Measurements of dark current versus temperature were also carried out in nitrogen atmosphere. From these measurements, the imperfection ionization energies of films prepared at various substrate temperatures were determined."
"The growth of silicon films on insulating substrates, their fabrication into active devices, and the advantages of such devices, especially for fast memory applications, were previously reported. Recent advances in these devices are described, including techniques of material growth and characterization, fabrication procedures, and device results. Thin-film resistors and capacitors operating at UHF have been prepared. With improvements in the material and device processing, bipolar transistors with current gains of 20-40 and useful operation between 500 and 1000 MHz were fabricated. MOS triodes and tetrodes which operate at the same frequency range and silicon-gate MOSFETs (SIGFETs), with voltage gains between 50-150 having negligible feedback capacitances (less than 0.02 pF/electrode), have been made. Thresholds of 1.5 and 2.5 V for p- and n-type devices were obtained. Application of these devices for microwave ICs and subnanosecond switching networks are described."
"Semiconducting properties of evaporated tellurium thin films, in the thickness range of 100 to 400 Å, are studied and correlated with observed structural properties. It is found that less-than-monolayer gold films can act as nucleation sites and stimulate the growth of large crystallites in deposited Te films. The Au-nucleated Te films are preferentially oriented with the c axis in the substrate plane and have crystallite diameters ranging from 2 to 5 µm. Hall mobilities as high as 250 cm2/V ċ s are observed in 400-Å Au-nucleated films with 5-µm crystallites. These large-grain films exhibit a temperature dependence for mobility of the form µ ∼ T3/2between 85°K and 250°K, while the carrier concentrations in the films do not change appreciably with temperature. Transconductances greater than 1000 µmhos are achieved for Au-nucleated Te thin-film transistors with 3-mil channels (operating with a saturated drain current of 1 mA). Several devices exhibit field-effect mobilities greater than 100 cm2/V ċ s, a value consistent with the observed Hall mobilities for similar films. Transconductance measurements indicate that Te thin-film transistor (TFT) instabilities result primarily from hole trapping at the Te-insulator interface. It is possible to alter the threshold voltage of Te TFTs by applying a gate bias at room temperature. Improved stability (changes in V0less than 50 mV in 1 h) is observed at 77°K. From the observed changes in threshold, a lower limit of the trapping-state density at the surface is inferred to be 5×1012traps/cm2. The surface-state density at the Te-SiO interface is estimated to be less than 6×1012surface states/cm2ċ eV as determined from capacitance and conductance measurements."

"The interaction between an applied microwave field at 4.85 GHz and a conical sample of n-InSb at 77°K used as a microwave circuit element is described. The principal interaction is found only when the cone axis contains the 〈111〉 crystal axis. The maximum interaction is found when the applied microwave electric field, a steady magnetic field, and an applied current pulse are in the same direction, namely, along the axis of the conical sample."
"A high-speed adder employing Gunn diodes is proposed. The system is constructed by using the threshold logic technique for high-speed carry propagation. Since all inputs of n stages with each weight are simultaneously applied to the anode of each Gunn diode to generate the nth carry at once, the operating speed of the adder should be considerably improved."

"By means of two simple examples, two commonly held misconceptions about optimum realizable linear filters (Wiener filters) are clarified. It is shown that 1) the magnitude of the transfer function of the Wiener filter for extracting a message from an additive white noise may be greater than unity in a range of frequencies, and 2) the Wiener filter for extracting a message from an additive colored noise may not be of minimum phase."
"Many random processes are characterized by damped exponential cosine autocorrelation functions. For some of these, like speech, most of the information is retained even when the signal is infinitely clipped. To describe such cases we put forward a probability distribution function for clipped waveforms whose power spectrum closely resembles the damped exponential cosine."
"MOSFET was applied as a voltage divider, whose gate electrode was made movable and effective gate voltage was supplied by resistive voltage division. The gate of MOSFET used in these experiments was 0.5 mm long and 10 mm wide, and the drain current could be changed from 0.14 mA to 3.6 mA."

An analytical method is developed for processing these reflection coefficient data. A critical evaluation of the numerical aspects of the method is included."

The autocorrelation function of the new binary-coded signal exhibits a quasi-uniform sidelobe distribution and a peak-to-sidelobe ratio which depends on the code length."
"An RF power transistor using tungsten metallization in the emitter and base contact areas, has been found to be far superior to aluminum with respect to failures due to hot spotting and second breakdown. Equivalent devices except having different metallization systems; all aluminum, all tungsten, and tungsten in the emitter-aluminum in the base; were evaluated by pulsing into collector-emitter breakdown. The tungsten metallized device was able to sustain 2.0 A of collector current without degradation while both the others failed at less than 1.0 A."

"Liquid crystal cells possess many properties that make their use in flat-panel displays very attractive. Most important, liquid crystal cells do not generate light but rather modify incident light, and they consume only a small amount of electrical energy while activated. The various electrical and optical properties of liquid crystal cells which make them useful for displays are reviewed in some detail. Several methods for speeding up the dynamic response of the cells are presented. The description of a variety of addressing schemes for activating liquid crystal cells in two-dimensional matrix displays is given. A number of these schemes have been tested in conjunction with a 2 × 18 element display matrix where the electrical environment of a full-size TV display has been faithfully simulated. The merits of both ac and dc excitation of cells in liquid crystal displays are discussed from the standpoint of complexity of addressing circuitry and operating life, as well as power consumption of the displays."
"This is a review paper. It is written for engineers, in particular practicing control engineers, who are familiar with transfer functions but not with state-variable techniques. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, it is intended to supplement a recent invited paper. (See A. E. Bryson, Jr., and D. G. Luenberger in Proc. IEEE, vol. 58, Nov. 1970, pp. 1803-1811.) The results introduced there by use of state-variable concepts are redeveloped in the frequency domain. Second, it demonstrates to engineers that, for the class of single-input multiple-output systems and multiple-input single-output systems, some of the results developed in state-variable equations can be obtained directly in transfer functions, even with less computation. Finally, the advantage and the limitation of the transfer function approach are discussed."

Many old results are reviewed, some new ones presented, and several open questions are posed."
"Previous work on a \"natural\" set of observables for time-varying Poisson point processes and its usefulness in analyzing continuous models of optical communication systems is briefly reviewed. The result on the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of delay is used to derive an approximate lower bound to the information rate of continuously position modulated laser pulses. It appears that the continuous PPM system has a potentially superior performance as compared to a discrete PPM system recently analyzed."

"Four high peak power LSA diode oscillators were exposed to high-energy neutron flux in successive steps. Oscillator failure resulted from a decrease in the diode breakdown voltage to the point that breakdown occurred at threshold for fluences of the order of 1014neutrons/cm2. The reduction in breakdown voltage and an observed frequency increase at a fixed bias can be related to an increase in the diode low field resistance which results primarily from neutron induced carrier removal."

"In an anisotropic compressible homogeneous plasma, the dispersion equation of waves along an infinitely long cylindrical \"grid-like\" antenna is obtained analytically. Numerical solutions of this equation show that an external static magnetic field has great influence upon the anomalously dispersive region of the dispersion relation around the plasma frequency."
"For a class of linear time-invariant feedback systems, a corresponding feedback system is considered. It is proved that the second system is input-output stable if and only if the original system is stable. Using this result, some known results on feedback, stability are extended. An example is presented illustrating the utility of these results."

 "A device for converting microwave power into either dc power or low-frequency ac power has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Rotational energy is stored in an electron beam by a Cuccia coupler, then converted to longitudinal energy by interaction with a space-dependent dc magnetic field, and finally recovered as electric energy by a depressed collector. A simple kinematic analysis demonstrates that the Cuccia coupler can convert large amounts of microwave power into electron beam rotation. Limits on the electric field strength and asynchronism between signal frequency and cyclotron frequency are established for both classical and relativistic coupler operation. Efficiency analyses of the process of conversion from orbital energy to dc electric energy, both classical and relativistic, indicate that the efficiency exceeds 95 percent for a particular range of operating conditions. As an ac power supply, the device responds to the modulating frequency of the signal. Theory predicts near-negligible harmonic distortion as well as flatness of frequency response from dc to about 1.0 MHz modulating frequency. Four tubes and a prototype (with \"artificial\" coupler) were tested experimentally. The first three tubes exhibited efficiencies up to 22 percent, being hindered by reflection of electrons into the coupler. Certain design changes were tested on the prototype, where efficiencies from 36 percent to 75 percent were obtained. Incorporating these design changes into the fourth tube yielded measured efficiencies up to 34 percent, or when corrected to disregard unusually large cavity losses, up to 59 percent. Experimental tests of the tube as an ac converter yielded excellent frequency response and about 20 percent second-harmonic distortion. It is concluded that the theoretical foundation of efficiency predictions has thus far been based on too optimistic assumptions."
"As a result of the inherent nonlinearity of the beam-circuit wave interaction process in high-power microwave amplifiers, there are harmonics generated when one signal is applied to the input and both harmonics and intermodulation products are generated when multiple component signals are applied. The effect of these generated signals is to reduce the available power levels of the fundamental signals. In this investigation multiple signals, noise, and combinations of these are considered as inputs to high-power traveling-wave and crossed-field amplifiers. A one-dimensional nonlinear theory is developed to consider multisignal inputs and harmonic generation and includes the effects of RF space charge, distributed circuit loss, and the variation of tube parameters with frequency. The theoretical results for the case of two input signals reveal both a strong larger amplitude capturing effect as well as a pronounced lower frequency signal preference. Both of these effects have also been observed experimentally using a high-power continuous-wave octave bandwidth traveling-wave amplifier. In addition to the multisignal studies a band of noise and combinations of noise and single-frequency signals have been applied to the experimental device. Measurements are made on the formation of noise intermodulation sidebands and on the degradation of a single-frequency input signal when a band of noise is simultaneously applied to the input of the traveling-wave amplifier. The noise is noticeably more effective in reducing the signal power level when it is positioned lower rather than higher in frequency with respect to the single-frequency signal. Experimental studies on a high-power continuous-wave wideband crossed-field amplifier are presented for comparison purposes. While the two devices are very similar in some respects they differ in others. For example the crossed-field amplifier shows a preference for a higher frequency signal which is just opposite to the traveling-wave tube results. In general the agreement between the theoretical and experimental multisignal results is good especially when the effects of distributed circuit loss and space-charge forces are included in the non-linear multisignal interaction equations."
"It has been observed that under certain conditions the electronic efficiency of M-type backward-wave oscillations (M-BWO's) can deteriorate appreciably. The deterioration in the efficiency of M-BWO's has been investigated from the viewpoint of cyclotron-wave interactions. It has been found that although the main cause of the deterioration is the interaction of the slow cyclotron wave with one of the forward circuit harmonic waves, other cyclotron-wave interactions can also result in reduction of efficiency. Design considerations of M-BWO's have been discussed that will avoid the simultaneous occurrence of any of the cyclotron-wave interactions within the useful frequency range of the oscillator. In this manner the useful bandwidth can also be maximized."
"The authors succeeded in producing continuous extremely short millimeter waves with waveguide magnetrons [1] of a special type, which will be called \"modified waveguide magnetrons\" [2] in order to distinguish them from conventional waveguide magnetrons. These magnetrons are very simple in construction and have stability of performance similar to conventional designs. Moreover, the wavelengths of the oscillations obtained with the present magnetrons are half those obtained with the conventional ones, at a given value of the magnetic flux density. Consequently, the present waveguide magnetrons can produce continuous output power of 20 mW at a wavelength of 1.54 mm, and a few milliwatts at a wavelength of 1.34 mm at the magnetic flux density of 45 kG produced with a conventional electromagnet. They can be successfully operated without cooling the tubes with water."
"The paper describes a new fabrication technology for a monolithic high-power linear IC. It is based on a novel process for controlling the epitaxial growth of single crystal regions and very fine polycrystalline regions on an IC substrate essentially in accordance with the specified mapping of the IC pattern. Polycrystalline regions are used in areas of isolation and collector lead paths which must be diffused deeply, and contribute to the most important characteristics required for the high-power IC, i.e., higher breakdown voltage and lower saturation resistance. A power capability far beyond any known in this field has been achieved. A typical example of the output power rating for an IC designed for use in a low-frequency SEPP-type power amplifier is 20-watts rms continuous service, and the total harmonic distortion content is less than 8 percent at 1 kHz at 40-volts source voltage."
"The usefulness of material for semiconductor devices can be degraded by the presence of deep impurity levels or traps which are often difficult to detect. The equations necessary for using the noise emitted by a uniform semiconductor when biased with a small dc current to find the energy, degeneracy factor, density, and time constants of such a deep level are derived. The theory was verified by an experimental study of a level in n-GaAs which was found to have an energy 0.175 eV below the conduction band and an acceptor-like degeneracy factor of 4. This technique appears to be useful for fundamental studies and as a means of monitoring material used for devices."
"This paper describes a new process for the fabricating of semiconductor devices, using a silicon nitride (Si3N4-masked thermally oxidized post-diffused mesa process (SIMTOP), which combines the advantages of both the mesa and planar processes while eliminating the disadvantages peculiar to each. An IMPATT diode was fabricated as a model vehicle for the process and the physical and electrical data are presented. A comparison is made of voltage breakdown on rectifier devices made by the mesa, planar, and SIMTOP process. Other applications of this new process are discussed and scanning electron microphotographs of the IMPATT structure are included."
"Ionization rates in semiconductors can be measured at low values of electric field using a new method involving a field-effect transistor (FET) structure which offers greater sensitivity than reverse biased p-n junction diode methods. Carriers of only one polarity cause ionization in the FET and no correction is required for ionization caused by carriers of the opposite polarity. Since secondary carriers resulting from ionization are attracted to a different terminal (gate or substrate) than that used to collect the primary carriers (drain), very small ionization currents can be detected. Values of electron ionization rate αnand hole ionization rate αpas low as 10-3cm-1have been obtained for silicon. The approximate relationship\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\infin}e^{-b/E}is observed and the values of α at high fields correspond to those obtained conventionally. Values of αpfrom 0.04-1to 0.4 cm-1have been obtained for germanium. Analytical determination of electric field was provided by a solution of Poisson's equation for the field-effect structure. Difficulty in accurately determining the FET channel doping introduces a ± 30 percent uncertainty in electric field values. The method is applicable to any semiconductor material where junction, MOS, or Schottky barrier techniques can be used to construct field-effect transistors."
"A closed form expression is obtained for the electric field distribution that results when a voltage is impressed on a system of surface wave interdigital electrodes. The conventional assumptions of weak piezoelectric coupling and of electrodes long compared with acoustic wavelength are made. Equivalence with previously reported results derived by a spatial harmonics method is explicitly demonstrated."
"Two LSA microstrip oscillators were made. The poor performance of the first oscillator was found by a time-domain computer simulation to be caused by poor circuit design and the effects of the LSA device package. A second circuit was constructed which eliminated the device package and used a more straightforward design. Thirty watts of RF power was generated in the second circuit at a frequency of 1.96 GHz, with an efficiency of 12.5 percent."
"Current pulses with frequencies in the vicinity of 1 kHz were observed in low-conductivity copper-doped GaAs. The coherent current pulses were obtained by applying an ac half-sinusoid voltage to low-conductivity bulk GaAs samples with indium ohmic contacts. The repetition rate increased as the applied voltage was increased. Illumination of the specimen surface or change in ambient temperature had a strong effect on the current pulses. The current pulses are due to ionization of deep levels and are compared to the microplasma pulses observed in Si and Ge p-n junctions."
"In a recent paper, Larrabee et al. proposed the magnetoresistance measurement for a quick determination of electron mobility in a functional Gunn diode. It is pointed out in this correspondence that the formula used in the paper is applicable only to extremely thin Gunn diodes where the length-to-width ratio is negligibly small. It is also shown how to obtain the correct value of the mobility by taking the geometry effect into consideration."
"General expressions for the multiplication factorMare derived for both step and linear graded junctions by integrating the common form for the ionization coefficient\\alpha(E)= \\alpha_{\\infin}exp(-b/E). Equal ionization coefficients are assumed. The results are compared with a commonly used approximation."
"Taking into account more rigorously such high field effects as velocity saturation and an increasing free carrier temperature, a new derivation is presented for the output noise of the field-effect transistor. It is shown that for devices with a short channel and a high saturation voltage the equivalent noise resistance can increase considerably above the low field value."

"A resonant microwave cavity loaded with photoconducting material is considered. The change in the power reflected from the cavity is derived in terms of the cavity-coupling coefficient and an interaction parameter involving the photoconductor parameters and the incident light signal amplitude. The effects of cavity coupling and high-frequency roll-off due to the photoconductor response are discussed. Experimental evidence is presented which is in good agreement with the analysis."
"It is well known that GaAs bulk-effect devices generate RF power by velocity-modulating the charge carriers. We have found through a small-signal analysis and computer simulations that RF power could also be generated by density modulation of the carriers if the diode is subcritically doped (n_{0}L<5\\times10^{11}cm-2) and carrier injection at the cathode is limited to appropriate values. This second power-generating mechanism is transit-time dependent and is optimum when the transit angle is approximately 3π/2. Under optimum conditions, when the two power-generating mechanisms are combined, the device efficiency exceeds what is predicted by the static velocity-electric field characteristic. Computer results indicate that for sinusoidal operation a peak-to-valley current ratio of 3 to 1 is achievable for an intrinsic peak-to-valley velocity ratio of 2.5 to 1. Experimental and computed results agree qualitatively."
"The geometric effects on the applied power dependence of the delay time preceding thermal breakdown in p-n junctions are predicted in terms of a linear heat-flow model and temperature-dependent reverse current. Measurements of the delay time on silicon planar p-n junctions of various areas are compared to the predictions and found to be in reasonable accord."
"The noise behavior of a Schottky barrier gate field-effect transistor is investigated by the use of the noise equivalent circuit. The influence of the carrier velocity saturation is estimated. The noise parameters are calculated by taking into account the influence of parasitic resistances. Measured and calculated noise parameters show good agreement in the frequency range 2-8 GHz."
"A new structure is given for the n-channel stacked gate MOS tetrode which consists of a polycrystalline silicon buried control gate and thermally grown oxide for the offset gate insulator. As a result of the large band-bending in the offset gate depletion region of an operating tetrode, some drain current electrons surmount the Si-SiO2energy barrier and are injected into the oxide. Since the electron trapping is relatively small in the thermal-oxide offset gate insulator, it was possible to measure gate currents of up to2 \\times 10^{-4}A/cm2. The gate current was measured as a function of the drain current, the drain voltage and the offset gate voltage. The resulting behavior confirms previous models of the tetrode device. Since electron trapping is much less in thermally grown oxide than in deposited pyrolytic oxide which was used formerly, the offset gate threshold voltage shifts less. As a result of this effect the new structure is used to advantage in fabricating the n-channel stacked gate tetrode in that the drain current is comparatively insensitive to changes in the offset gate voltage."
"This paper describes the design calculations and fabrication techniques used to produce hyperabrupt varactor diodes. The computation consists of determining, the doping profile, the capacitance as a function of applied voltage, the breakdown voltage, and the series resistance; allowance is made for the nonlinear variation of mobility with doping density. Fabrication of the retrograded region was accomplished by diffusion from a doped-oxide source. Two groups of diodes were fabricated. The first group had a breakdown voltage VBof 95 V at 1 µA, a capacitance ratio of 12 over a voltage range of 1 to 40 V (C_{P1}/C_{P40}=12), and a quality factorQof 60 at an operating level of 3 V and 100 MHz. The corresponding values for the second group were VB=45 V (C_{P1}/C_{P40}=4) andQ=210. The capacitance tracking capability of these diodes was found to be within 2 percent. These measurements showed excellent correlation with calculated results."
"The electrical resistivity of pulsed discharges in flash-tubes using noble gases is treated in a simple manner. Relations between resistivity and electric fieldEand current densityjare given. It is shown that electrical resistivity in pulsed discharges is an inverse function ofjorE, depending also on an exponentnwhich does not remain constant during the discharge."
"A brief review of existing means of generating charactors for visual display reveals certain deficiencies. A new character-generating monoscope has been developed to overcome these problems. Its novel all-electrostatic electron-optical system produces, at high speed, well-defined images of the target symbols which can be designed to customer requirements. The tube is cheap, and its low voltage and power requirements enable significant cost savings to be made in the associated circuits. Its small dimensions, 30-mm diameter by 175-mm long, facilitate its use in small desk-mounted display units. The stencil target imposes no limitation on the usage nor on the operational life of the monoscope. The tube uses a new electron gun with low cathode loading. Four tubes have been life-tested to date and have so far achieved more than 3000 operational hours with negligible loss in performance. Lifetimes exceeding 5000 hours are expected. The tube has been used in computer visual display terminals and for labeling radar screens."
"Extensive design optimization studies on a prototype series of klystrons have been carried out using a digital computer simulation, Five parameters were investigated for their effect on efficiency: 1) penultimate cavity tuning; 2) pre-penultimate cavity tuning; 3) beam perveance; 4) pre-pre-penultimate cavity tuning; and 5) output gap transit angle, These studies indicate that the power conversion efficiency of a high-power narrow-band multicavity klystron of optimum design should lie in the 70-80 percent range. A tube of near-optimum design was built and its performance was carefully measured as a function of two parameters: 1) penultimate and pre-penultimate cavity tuning; and 2) beam voltage. The measured data were used as a guide to determine the choice of beamfilling factor and beam power interception for best correlation with computed results. The measured efficiency was 62±1.5 percent compared to the computed value of 64 percent. Careful attention was paid to the repeatability of the efficiency measurements and to the effect of nonideal pulse shape on calorimetric measurements. Beam interception at large-signal levels appears to be the phenomenon which limits efficiency in the present tube."
"Improved sensitivity is obtained by transversely magnetizing a photodetector comprising a section of waveguide partially loaded with a bulk photoconductor.

"Metal-semiconductor contact injection on the junction side of diffused-mesa avalanche diodes has been found to have a significant effect on the performance of these diodes as oscillators. A minority carrier injection ratio of 6 percent reduces the efficiency of what would be 9 percent efficient diodes to less than 1 percent and increases the FM noise by a factor of 2 as tested in a 6-GHz oscillator circuit. The dependence of the minority carrier injection ratio of the metal-semiconductor barrier upon current density has been measured and quantitatively modeled. Calculated values of diode admittance, including the effects of injection at the contact, are shown to be in agreement with measured values of both small-signal diode admittance versus frequency and large-signal diode admittance versus RF voltage. Germanium avalanche diodes with low-minority carrier injection contacts have demonstrated CW oscillation efficiencies greater than 9 percent at 6 GHz. The realization of low-injection contacts is shown to be a requirement for achievement of high-efficiency avalanche oscillation."
"Two-frequency operation of IMPATT diodes is examined in this paper on a conceptual basis. It is shown that a simple interpretation of the \"single-frequency\" admittances of the diode may be made. An equivalent circuit is presented which shows that the effect of second-harmonic tuning is to introduce a nonlinear resonance into the fundamental input admittance. This occurs when the external circuit admittance is tuned to the neighborhood of the \"single-frequency\" oscillator admittance of the diode at the second-harmonic. Computer calculations of the tuned-harmonic mode, with the diode embedded in the simplest possible RF circuit, are presented to demonstrate the effect."
"Minority-carrier lifetime in a forward-biased asymmetrical p-n junction diode can be measured by observing the time response of the diode to a sudden reversing step voltage. An approximate but general theory for p-n junctions with almost arbitrary impurity gradients is developed, and its results are within about 25 percent of those previously obtained for the special cases of ideal step and exponentially graded junctions. A relatively simple experimental technique is described which is suitable for measuring lifetimes down to less than 1 ns. Measurements at extreme ambients are facilitated by the fact that the test diode is mounted at the end of a single coaxial line which can be arbitrarily long. The raw data from the experiment are in the form of an oscilloscope trace, which provides an immediate qualitative and semiquantitative indication of the minority-carrier lifetime and the penetration length for the injected carriers. A graphical presentation of the theoretical results leads quickly to a more precise quantitative evaluation of these parameters. In addition, the technique can be used to measure an average junction depletion capacitance and the device series resistance."
"The output power of Gunn oscillators is limited by the increased temperature which affects the velocity-field curve and which may also permanently damage the diode or the metal contacts. The behavior of these oscillators indicates that the dissipation power density is more or less inhomogeneous, depending on the kind of oscillation mode. The present paper makes use of simple models of the dipole domain mode and the accumulation mode in an analysis of the inhomogeneous dissipation power density. The temperature increase caused by this dissipation power is then calculated. The temperature dependence on diode dimensions and mounting is also discussed. It is shown that the temperature is lower when the anode is turned towards the heat sink than when the cathode is turned the same way. This difference amounts to 150°K for an accumulation mode diode with 500°K maximum temperature in the former case."
"The external quantum efficiency of GaP red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) degrades under forward-biased operation. The degradation is a complex phenomenon which in the long run is dominated by changes in the bulk semiconductor. This paper is restricted to the discussion of bulk degradation. The symptoms of the degradation are: 1) for a given forward current, the activation energy of the degradation is 0.5-0.8 eV and 2) for a fixed forward voltage, the light output is virtually unchanged while the forward current increases. The nonradiative excess current responsible for the degradation is probably a tunneling current. The introduction of metallic impurities such as copper into the semiconductor material does not appreciably change the initial quantum efficiency of the device. On the other hand, it shortens the lifetime of the device by several orders of magnitude under forward-biased operation. The symptoms of the degradation for the copper-contaminated devices are identical to those of the noncontaminated devices including the activation energy of the degradation. It is inferred therefore that fast moving impurities such as copper are the major cause of the bulk degradation. Liquid gallium is a known getter for metallic impurities such as copper. For junctions grown in the liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) process using high-purity gallium, the longer life can be attained by the careful elimination of metallic impurities during material growth and device processing."
"The behavior of transferred-electron bulk negative differential conductivity devices with nonuniform geometries and various doping profiles is analyzed. Computer solutions were obtained for appropriate transport equations generalized by a scheme to simulate arbitrary areal variation. The solutions show that the effects of doping and geometrical nonuniformities on domain dynamics are similar. The product of doping and transverse area plays an important role in determining the space-charge properties. An important practical implication of the above result is demonstrated by a scheme for device design using combinations of geometrical and doping nonuniformities to achieve a desired control characteristic. Various equivalent device configurations yielding a linear frequency-voltage characteristic over a wide frequency range are proposed."
"The current flow equations for nondegenerate and degenerate semiconductors at low temperature are discussed in terms of the Boltzmann transport equation. It is shown that the diffusion current in an inhomogeneous but isotropic semiconductor must be expressed as q.D(r). ∇n(r) where n(r) is the carrier (electron) concentration and D(r) is a spatially varying diffusion \"constant.\" Some formulas which have been given for semiconductor device parameters, i.e., the emitter efficiency for heavily doped transistors when expressed as a ratio of resistivities, could be rigorously developed if the diffusion current were expressible as q.∇[D(r)n(r)]. However, this form is not consistent with the transport equation from which D(r) can be defined and evaluated."
"The classical capacitance-voltage relations based on abrupt space-charge edge approximations, while adequate at large reverse bias, do not adequately describe the capacitance near zero bias. This paper presents explicit capacitance-voltage relations valid near zero bias for linearly graded and exponential-constant profiles. For linearly graded junctions, the intercept in a 1/C3versus voltage plot is shown to be well approximated by the \"gradient voltage\" defined by Vg= 2/3 kT/q ln a2εkT/q/8qni3. Also presented is an accurate numerical technique for machine computation of the transition region capacitance for any doping profile. Explicit relations obtained by dimensional considerations and curve fitting on numerical solutions are free of singularities, hence useful in computer-aided device design and doping profile determination."
"When carrier density is normalized and recombination neglected, a single transport element accounts for both drift and diffusion. Optical generation is modeled by discrete current sources, and expressions for lumped elements are obtained in terms of integrals of the doping profile. Good physical intuition with respect to the effect of the profile on photocurrent transport is obtained, and analytical calculation of device quantum efficiency is facilitated."
"A computation method to obtain an exact small-signal solution of a one-dimensional transistor model for high-frequency operation is presented under the assumption of negligible bulk recombination effect. Basis for the small-signal calculation is 1) a dc solution at the operating point under consideration, 2) trial potentials (electrostatic potential and quasi-Fermi potentials for electrons and holes, respectively), and 3) frequency. A scheme for iterative computation can be constructed in a manner similar to that for dc steady state given by Gummel. Discussions are made on conservation of the total currents, terminal currents relationship, as on a simplified method to obtain terminal characteristics. Some computation results will be demonstrated for potentials, carrier densities, current densities, and the current transfer factor. In the Appendix the relation between the exact solution and low-frequency treatment will be discussed."
"A theory for frequency multipliers with charge storage diodes is developed including the effects of finite transition time. The transition loss due to the charge storage diode turn-off transient is taken into account with a charge-controlled diode model which requires only limited mathematical effort and has readily measurable characteristics. Furthermore, it very well describes the performance of multipliers: the analytical results agree well with measurements."
"Space-charge wave propagation for periodic-electrostatically focused electron beams with nonuniform radial beam density distributions is the subject of this paper. The dispersion equation is obtained by solving a differential equation for the ac electric potential inside the electron beam and by matching the solution at the boundaries. An approximate analytic solution and a digital computer treatment are described. The reduced plasma frequency obtained is expressed in terms of the focusing parameters and is compared with that of a Brillouin beam. A study of the differential equation involved suggests that there are certain ranges of system parameters (\"forbidden\" zones) for which no wave propagation is possible, that is, no space-charge mode can be supported there."

"A new electronic charge storage tube that utilizes storage targets fabricated by selective etching of thermally grown SiO2films on silicon substrates is described. The completed targets have a storage density of 600 000 elements/cm2. The flexibility of silicon technology allows targets to be designed with continuous readout time in the range of 3 to 30 min, with a corresponding erase time of 2 to 60 TV frames, respectively. Images may be stored for as long as 45 days without loss of resolution. The present limiting resolution is approximately 500 TV lines, making the tube capable of storing excellent television-quality images. The tube is capable of performing selective erase, write, and read."
"Accurate low-frequency MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) and SIS (semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor) C-V curves are found by solving Poisson's equation in the bulk semiconductor using regions of analytic solution joined by numerical solutions of specified accuracy. The technique uses the full Fermi function for the electron, hole, and impurity bands; thus valid results can now be obtained for partially ionized impurity bands, and situations in which the valence or conduction bands are bent through the Fermi level. The calculation can be carried out for any temperature and allows for band structure in the valence and conduction bands. Surface states are incorporated at the interface and the usual low-frequency capacitance curves are obtained for the MOS device. As expected, the C-V curves in the SIS case are more complex. The n-i-n (n-type semiconductor, insulator, n-type semiconductor) device shows two depletion minima separated by a center maxima whose size is sensitive to surface-state charge. In the p-i-n device, the depletion minima can be seen separately only if the impurity concentrations of the semiconductors differ by a factor of five or more. In that case, a deep narrow minimum due to the lightly doped semiconductor can be seen superimposed on one end of a broad shallow minimum due to the heavily doped semiconductor. This work predicts an interesting high-frequency response for the n-i-n structure, namely a bell-shaped C-V curve. This type of C-V response has not been observed to date in two-terminal passive devices, and may lead to SIS applications as a new type of parametric capacitor."
"By taking account of the carrier mobility degradation at high impurity concentrations, the high-frequency base transport factor of an n-p-n germanium base transistor was computed numerically for different base doping levels. The doping profiles under consideration were Gaussian and complementary error functions. The base doping level adjacent to the emitter was optimized for minimum base transit time. The optimum values are 4×1017atom/ cm3for complementary error function profile and 2×1017atom/cm3for Gaussian profile. The effects of emitter barrier capacitance, base resistance, collector barrier capacitance, and the collector depletion layer on the overall frequency response of a junction transistor are also discussed."
"Gate shorts caused by electrical breakdown of the gate dielectric are a major yield and reliability problem for MOS transistors and integrated circuits. Diodes or diffused resistors with breakdown voltages of about 40 V can be used to protect the gate from high voltage transients or static discharges. This paper provides a uniform approach to gate protection. It is shown theoretically that in order to obtain effective gate protection: the protecting device should have a low dynamic resistance in breakdown; the breakdown voltage of the protecting device should be above, but close to, the maximum gate operating voltage; and protection by a diffused resistor in series with the gate is much more effective than by a diode in parallel with the gate. It is shown experimentally that, compared to the widely used fieldplate-induced breakdown, breakdown due to reach-through to a highly doped substrate provides: a dynamic resistance that is almost two orders of magnitude lower; reasonable control of the breakdown voltage; much better protection against simulated static discharges. Since under pilot line conditions no adverse effects on performance or yield have been observed, reach-through breakdown devices seem to improve gate protection decisively without any coincident disadvantages."
"Electron beam aberrations resulting from deflection by two sets of similar, mutally perpendicular electrostatic deflectors have been studied. The analysis is applicable to the cases where the beam can be treated as a collection of noninteracting individual electrons deflected through a small angle by spatially smooth fields. The analysis shows that, with the types of electrostatic deflectors commonly used, anastigmatism cannot be achieved unless external corrections are employed."

"The characteristics of TRAPATT oscillations in a p-in diode are discussed and an approximate semi-analytical solution for the diode voltage waveform is derived when the diode current is a square wave. It is shown that a traveling avalanche zone is not necessary to generate a dense \"trapped\" plasma and that the boundary conditions prevent the trapped plasma from completely filling the depletion layer. Typical voltage waveforms and corresponding diode power, efficiency, and impedance at the fundamental and higher harmonics are presented. When the diode current is a square wave the diode does not necessarily exhibit a negative resistance at all higher harmonics. A computer program for TRAPATT oscillations in a p-i-n diode is described. Its running time is two or three orders of magnitude less than more exact time domain computer analyses. Typical results of diode power, dc to RF conversion efficiency, and required circuit impedances are presented for several different current waveforms which are composed of up to the seventh harmonic of a square wave and the first two harmonics of a half-wave sine wave. It is shown that high-efficiency oscillations are possible with diode currents composed of only the fundamental and one harmonic."
"Experimental evidence is presented which distinguishes two mechanisms whereby an avalanche diode can efficiently generate microwaves at transit angles below those of classical transit-time oscillations. Measurements of external current waveforms and subsequent calculations of terminal voltage waveforms demonstrated that efficient generation (η ∼10 percent) of microwaves was possible at sub-harmonics of transit-time excitations. This subharmonic generation occurred when various harmonic components interacted such that the peak total voltage was delayed with respect to the fundamental. In such cases of multiharmonic synergetic excitations, the peak displacement currents were less than 0.25 of that required for avalanche shock-front initiation. The distinguishing features of high-efficiency operation (η ∼50 percent) were found to be completely consistent with a trapped-plasma mode interpretation. Experimental external current and dV/dt waveforms have substantiated Evans' circuit analysis [28]. dV/dt waveforms indicated peak displacement currents at breakdown which were on the order of 1.5 times that required for shock-front initiation. Approximate conduction current waveforms exhibited larger currents during the shock-front transit than during the extraction period. General features were consistent with calculations made by Cottam [29]. Circuit characteristics for both subharmonic generation and the trapped-plasma mode were similar. Circuit analysis also indicated the critical importance of each separate harmonic of a trapped-plasma mode fundamental. Harmonic generation utilizing the trapped-plasma mode enabled an extension of the upper bound of the frequency of efficient generation."
"The dynamic pyromagnetic response of several materials with magnetic phase transitions near 300°K has been measured by a method initially described by Chynoweth [1]. The results indicate that practical broad-band pyromagnetic radiation detectors operating in a fast dynamic thermal mode are possible. The best results were obtained with gadolinium and manganese germanide crystals which have second-order magnetic phase transitions slightly below 300°K. Their responses peaked at 300°K, but remained high over fairly large temperature ranges, a 25°C interval in the case of gadolinium. The NEP of ∼ 10-8W.Hz-1/2(0.12 cm2active area) obtained with gadolinium is larger by a factor of 10 than that reported for 300°K pyroelectric detectors, but was limited by laboratory noise pickup in the detector coil rather than the internal Johnson noise. Improved techniques should result in lower NEPs. The pyromagnetic responses at the critical temperatures of two materials with first-order magnetic phase transitions, FeRh and MnAs, were considerably smaller than expected. They were also anomalously discontinuous compared with the measured step in the static magnetization. A third material, Fe.71Mn1.44As, with a first-order transition at 344°K, gave a much larger response, but over a very narrow temperature range."
"The address and drive circuit requirements of dc gas discharge display panels are described with particular reference to devices developed by Weston and Hall [1]-[3] and de Boer [6.] Drive systems are being developed for displays both with and without inherent memory. The choice of system available is dependent both on the type of information to be displayed and the characteristics of the discharge cells. In this paper the influence of factors such as ignition, maintaining and extinguishing potentials and spreads, ignition delay time and deionization or \"recovery\" time is discussed in relation to cyclically driven and storing displays and for various types of data. Two systems of particular interest are a tabular alphanumeric data display and a random-address graphics display. An experimental tabular display has been constructed in the laboratory and is briefly described. This is designed ultimately to present 800 characters simultaneously, but at present uses a composite matrix of 48 rows and 50 columns to show up to 48 characters for test purposes. Random-address drive systems for use with panels having internal resistors are also discussed. It is shown how, in both systems, a careful choice of bias and pulse switching conditions makes optimum use of the gas discharge characteristics."
"Operational characteristics of a 50-GW high-field-emission diode are discussed in detail. The diode is shown empirically to have two distinct modes of operation, with corresponding impedances, which depend on the diode aspect ratio, pressure, and total voltage and current. The first mode indicates rectilinear electron flow, with impedance shown to be about ½ that predicted by the Child-Langmuir Law for pressures ranging from 5 × 10-3to 10-5torr. The second mode displays a pressure-dependent \"funneling\" phenomenon in the gap region with radial compression of the electrons. For this condition the diode impedance is ≤ Child-Langmuir predictions. Theoretical models by Friedlander and de Packh for estimating the occurrence of funneling conditions are verified. Experimental evidence of funneling is presented for values of v/γ, (measured) above 80 percent of v/γ, (critical)."
"The flame sensor consists of a photoelectric counter tube which is triggered by ultraviolet photons emitted by flames in the spectral region beyond the solar cutoff. Tubes of this type have been made previously, but this new tube differs in being able to operate in ambient temperatures up to and in excess of 1000°F. The new tube has high sensitivity and a lower operating voltage than older tubes. The flame sensor is encapsulated in a titanium and forsterite ceramic envelope and uses a sapphire window to admit the ultraviolet photons. The photocathode consists of a molybdenum rod which has been cleaned by heating and sputtering. The anode is a molybdenum hemisphere, which also serves as a mirror to concentrate the light from the flame on the photocathode. The gas-fill is 100 torr of a helium-argon mixture, where the small amount of argon is used to help remove helium metastables following a count. The sensor operating voltage is about 150 V, and a dead time of 1 ms or more is used to avoid multiple counting. Typical counting rates obtained with a small methane flame at 12 ft are 60 per second. A sensor was life-tested at 1000°F in air for longer than 2000 hours."

 "The investigation reported here presents both analytical and experimental results on the noise performance of phototransistors. The noise performance of phototransistors depends on fluctuations traceable to two main sources: 1) the random fluctuations in the rate of photon arrival; and 2) mechanisms inherent in the device such as fluctuations in the generation of free carriers, diffusion and recombination fluctuations, and 1/f mechanisms, to cite a few. On the basis of corpuscular arguments, it is shown that the important fluctuations may be represented by simple, partially correlated shot noise current generators in parallel with the device junctions for a wide range of frequencies. The hybrid-pi transistor model and these noise generators have been used to derive an expression for the noise current to the short-circuited output of a phototransistor. Attention has been primarily focused on the low-frequency expression since correction terms due to high-frequency effects are negligible. The output noise spectra of commercially available silicon phototransistors and silicon units fabricated at the Microelectronics Laboratory of the University of Florida have been measured. The measurements are in good agreement with the model. The current gains and beta cutoff frequencies of these devices have been computed by interpreting the measured spectra with the aid of the analytical results. Independent ac and dc measurements of these parameters are in satisfactory agreement with values determined from noise measurements. It is thereby ascertained that noise measurements on phototransistors can be used to characterize them in terms of current gain and beta cutoff frequency."
"In addition to offering such desirable performance characteristics as very large bandwidth and appreciably high current gain, transistors manufactured by diffusion techniques possess a high frequency voltage capability that is significantly in excess of the breakdown voltage which materializes under quiescent operating conditions. This paper attributes voltage capability enhancement in diffused transistors to the excess phase which is evidenced in the current gain characteristics of these devices. An \"excess breakdown function,\" developed in this paper, permits direct calculation of the factor by which quiescent breakdown specifications can be safely exceeded at given frequencies of operation."
"In this paper a closed form expression for the intermodulation output power from a semiconductor diode driven by an arbitrary number of \"small-level\" input signals is obtained. The effect of the intrinsic resistance of the diode material is taken into consideration through the use of the modified exponential function for the diode characteristic. It has been found that the relative harmonic distortion depends on the bias voltage, which agrees with the experimental observations. This dependence would not have been obtained had the intrinsic resistance been neglected. Also, the calculated intermodulation output power shows good agreement, for small input signal, with the published experimental results."
"Base diffusion isolated transistors (BDI) designed for low power, nonsaturating, integrated circuits have been fabricated. Buried collectors are unnecessary in these low power devices, resulting in structures equivalent to discrete transistors in complexity of fabrication. A low-current power supply is required for isolation purposes. Transistor characteristics differ negligibly from those of standard transistors at collector currents <0.05 mA, and are satisfactory for application in linear circuits at currents up to at least 0.1 mA. Transistor fTis 80 MHz at 0.1 mA emitter current, 2 V collector voltage."
"Coupled-mode theory is used to describe the propagation of waves on a nonuniform crossed-field beam in a drift region. The nonuniformity considered in this paper is due to potential variation along the beam. Numercial solutions are obtained for the normal-mode amplitudes for two types of potential variation, namely, linear and exponential. It is shown that the coupling between the modes, which is due to the potential variation, can be used to reduce the noise figure of crossed-field amplifiers."
"The operation of an RF triggered cold-cathode crossed-field amplifier is briefly described, and the problem is posed of how the beam builds up, since it is necessary for it to remain in an inherently debunching phase region for more than 20 successive impacts on the cathode. A partial answer is provided by numerical calculations showing that the velocity of a repeatedly impacting beam differs from E/B in a way which introduces a new phase-focusing mechanism. It is found that buildup can also occur without exact synchronism over a range of calculated voltages which agree closely with measurement. The principles of two computer programs are described, one covering the buildup region of negligible space charge, and the other the transition and power-generating regions where space charge becomes important. Quantitative conclusions are drawn concerning the velocity and direction of impacts on the cathode, which vary markedly as the space charge density changes."
"A confined-flow large-signal formulation of the klystron interaction equations is presented and applied to the analysis of the multicavity klystron amplifier. The effects of cavity voltage, cavity phase, drift length, and beam parameters are studied. The two- and three-cavity amplifiers are studied in detail, and several numerical examples of four-cavity klystrons are also given. A significant second-harmonic component of velocity modulation is shown to improve the dc to RF conversion efficiency. Two methods of obtaining this modulation are discussed. The large-signal theory presented here has been used to design a five-cavity klystron which is 50 percent efficient and has a controllable power transfer curve. Theoretical and experimental power transfer curves are presented for several 1 1/4-MW klystrons; the calculated output power is between 4 and 10 percent greater than the experimental values."
"Operation in the accumulation mode of Gunn-type oscillation is experimentally observed in n-type germanium samples oriented to ∠100∠, 360 µm long and with carrier concentration of 1015cm-3at 77°K."
"Silicon oxynitride films deposited on a HF-etched Si surface show a large fixed positive charge in the dielectric (2-3 × 10-2cm-2). This charge is shown by etch-back experiments to be located near the silicon-oxynitride interface. Negative charge is injected into the oxynitride film if a negative bias larger than 2.8 × 105V/cm is applied during irradiation. For saturation doses (about 1-2 Mrad of absorbed radiation), the magnitude of the injected charge can become as large or larger than the original positive charge in the oxynitride. The injected negative charge, is shown to be located at the silicon-oxynitride interface by etch-back experiments. The injection of negative charge under the above conditions appears to be an electronic phenomenon. An ionic mechanism appears unlikely because re-irradiation at room temperature without application of a bias restores the original flat-band condition of the MIS capacitor."
"Variations with temperature in the threshold voltage of n- and p-channel MOS transistors are obtained by calculation as well as measurement, with the results comparing quite closely. The amount of voltage change per °C under normal operating conditions is found to be dependent upon the channel doping concentration. The calculations show that for either n- or p-channel devices the voltage change per °C is -4 mV/°C for an impurity concentration of 3 × 1016/cm3and -2 mV/°C for an impurity concentration of 1015/cm3. This information is important because if the MOS transistor is subjected to a changing temperature environment, the accompanying threshold voltage change may be intolerable."
"Experimentally measured noise power spectra of the dynamic crossed-field photomultiplier are presented, along with data which describe the sampling characteristics of the device. Sampling is shown to introduce excess noise of the order of 3 dB."
"A numerical study of the equations governing the electric field in Gunn effect materials under constant bias shows that static negative resistance (SNR) can occur as a bulk effect when certain conditions regarding carrier diffusion are satisfied. This result places an important limitation on Shockley's positive conductance theorem in that a completely general extension of the theorem to cases where diffusion is field dependent cannot exist."
"Temperature dependence of breakdown voltage in silicon abrupt p+-n junctions has been calculated using a modified Baraff theory [1]-[3] and measured experimentally from 77°K to 500°K, with substrate doping from 1015cm-3to 1018cm-3. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of theoretical calculations. These results strongly substantiate the validity of the modified Baraff theory which has been pointed out by Sze and Crowell."
"Studies conducted on a number of silicon power transistors indicate that for some devices a hot spot, once formed, will remain even though the power dissipation is reduced to a level at which operation was previously free of hot spots. The hot spot can be eliminated only by a significant reduction in power dissipation from the level at which the hot spot first appeared. The effect of the hot spot on reliable device operation is discussed."
"We describe a surface acoustic wave interdigital transducer designed to display enhanced response at harmonics of its fundamental operating frequency. The performance of the transducer compares well with predictions based on a simple model."

"A new voltage-variable tuning capacitor is described. Using conventional fabrication techniques, metal-insulator-semiconductor and p-n junction structures are combined to obtain the high voltage sensitivity and low capacitance tolerances required to tune the AM broadcast band. Other potential applications are cited. A simple theory of operation based on nonequilibrium conditions is given together with experimental verification. Devices fabricated with a 530-Å-thick SiO2insulator on n/n+epitaxial silicon exhibit capacitance ratios of 15:1 in 14 V with a minimum Q of 170. The reverse current is two orders of magnitude higher than expected. This is attributed to growth defects in the epitaxial layer which give rise to a low minority carrier lifetime τ0∼0.1 µs and a high surface recombination velocity S0∼500 cm/s."
"We have demonstrated nonreciprocal millimeter-wave properties, first observed by us, in a waveguide loaded with a thin slab of n-InSb at room temperature by the construction of three kinds of nonreciprocal devices, all operating at W-band frequencies. Measurements have shown that the nonreciprocal properties previously observed at K-band are indeed maintained from the microwave to the millimeter-wave region and the characteristics of our devices are comparable with those we developed at K-band frequencies. These results show that the development of practical solid-state wide-band nonreciprocal millimeter-wave devices should be possible."
"Recent evidence has indicated that kilovolt-energy protons are a probable cause for solar-cell array degradation in synchronous-orbit satellites. This damage can occur in the small areas of the cell that have been unprotected by the coverslip. This paper reports on solar-cell current degradation at fixed voltages in nominal 10-Ω.cm silicon solar cells with coverslips which are irradiated by 150- and 270-keV protons. The damage, which is shown to be dependent on exposed area and proton energy, can be minimized by putting adhesive on uncovered cell areas or by reducing the open area with close-fitting coverslips."
"Studies of the properties of a new insulated-gate field-effect tetrode which consists basically of an IGFET triode having a resistive-gate electrode with connections transverse to the source-drain dimension are described. Experimental tetrodes on silicon with nichrome gates are fabricated to demonstrate applications of the device as a mixer, an amplitude modulator, and an AGC amplifier. Theories are also developed to calculate the static and the high-frequency characteristics of the tetrode, and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results."
"Noise performance of a high-gain transistor is presented. It is shown that both burst noise and flicker noise in high-gain transistors are not as important as those in low-gain units. At very small biases, less than 10 µA for the given transistor, the limiting noise of the transistor is dominated by the shot noise. In the higher bias region the thermal noise of the base resistance is the dominant noise of the transistor. It is also demonstrated that from noise measurement the base resistance rb'b, the transconductance gm, and the small signal common emitter-current gain β can be accurately determined."
"Large-signal computer simulations of GaAs LSA relaxation oscillations in an X-band waveguide iris circuit are presented. The study is focused on a particular oscillator and a realistic model of an experimental circuit is used. However, the results are typical for other LSA relaxation oscillators. Basic features of the microwave circuit, characteristic voltage and current waveshapes, frequency tuning with bias voltage, and oscillator starting transients are discussed. The RF output power is shown to build up in less than ten cycles. Circuit optimization for high dc to RF conversion efficiency is discussed and circuit data for nearly 30 percent efficiency are given. Finally, efficiency degradation is discussed when doping gradients are present, and effciencies of 15 and 10 percent appear possible for doping gradients as high as 20 and 60 percent, respectively. Hence, the LSA relaxation mode is shown to be less sensitive to doping gradients than the sinusoidal LSA mode."
"Oversized n-GaAs diodes operating in the LSA mode with doping-to-frequency ratios in the 1-5×105s/cm3range are investigated in circuits that contain a short-circuited high impedance transmission line foreshortened to resonate the electronic parallel capacitance of the diode. By comparing computer simulations with experiments, such diodes are shown to operate in a nonsinusoidal LSA relaxation mode which offers good efficiency, effective space-charge control, and a fast buildup of the oscillations; details of the computer program are also given. A simple analysis is developed which defines the inductive and capacitive time constants controlling the voltage waveshape and explains the frequency tuning with bias voltage and the effective space-charge control. The analysis is shown to be suitable for oscillator design purposes."
"In the LSA oscillation mode, a transferred-electron diode behaves capacitively at any frequency. Theoretical calculations suggest that the equivalent capacitance decreases, and therefore the oscillation frequency increases, when either the bias or the temperature is increased. This is proposed as a criterion for determining whether the oscillation is of the LSA type."
"A qualitative comparison is made between computed and measured electric fields in typical TM010klystron cavities. The computer code LALA is shown to apply effectively to cavities with offset gaps which are difficult to solve analytically, and a bead-pull technique using a highly directive perturbing needle is utilized to verify the theoretical results. The magnitude of the radial field components is discussed as well as the shape of the axial field resulting from shaping the drift tube noses and offsetting the gap."

 "Electrochemically passivated Ti(Pd)Ag contacts for Si solar cells have been developed. The passivation is accomplished by shifting the electrochemical exchange potential of the Ti/Ag couple into positive direction by the addition of a layer of Pd between the Ti and the Ag layers. The new contacts do not degrade during humidity stress tests. They withstand temperature cycling from -- 196°C to +150°C, can be subjected to high temperatures, and are compatible with solderless interconnection schemes."
"A theory of photovoltaic effects in nonhomogeneous semiconductors which takes into account the variations of bandgap, effective masses, mobilities, majority carrier concentrations, and pair lifetime is presented. The photovoltaic effects observed on graded-composition CdxHg1-xTe single crystals are essentially due to the gradient of gap, but are strongly reduced by the diffusion length and resistivity variations, in accordance with the theoretical predictions."
"Models of the photovoltaic cell proposed by various authors are subjected to a critical examination to isolate their underlying assumptions and to devise possible experimental tests of the models. The results of an investigation of a model in which the Cu2S layer plays an active role are presented. These include a calculation of spectral response and a comparison of calculated and measured spectral response curves; an electron microprobe study whose conclusion is that the Cu2S layer is thinner than 0.5 µm; a discussion of the crossover of dark and lighti-Vcharacteristics and a test of whether this shift is adequately explained by an internal series resistance; and a study of the effects of low-energy proton irradiation on the properties of Cu-Cd-S cells."
"The effects of shadows on the current-voltage characteristics of solar cell circuits are studied and used for the development of several mathematical models. These models describe circuits of any geometry with or without shunt or blocking diodes. For efficient analyses of larger arrays the concept of the shadowing factor is developed. All models are useful in analyses performed by hand or digital computer, using theoretical or empirical input data."
"Following the earlier demonstration of the performance capabilities of 4-mil silicon solar cells and the feasibility of using these cells on large flexible arrays of space vehicles, more than a thousand 4-mil cells have been fabricated in pilot production by four routes. The various types of cells that have been evaluated had solderless evaporated titanium-silver contacts in both a conventional and wraparound configuration, solderless evaporated titanium-silver contacts \"overplated\" with a layer of copper-gold, and solderless plated mickel-copper-gold contacts in a conventional and wraparound configuration. Both 1-by-2-cm and 2-by-2-cm, n on p cells have been manufactured from 1 and 10 Ω . cm boron-doped silicon. In every case, satisfactory production yields have been achieved. The above cells have been subjected to environmental conditions aimed at studying the effects of high-ambient humidity on the cell contacts during \"shelf life\" prior to launch and the degradation in performance from electron and proton irradiation encountered during long-term spiral transfer orbits to synchronous altitude. Specifically the problem of low-energy \"synchronous altitude\" proton irradiation of exposed bar and back contacts and the protection afforded by various forms of coatings has been investigated."
"The Lincoln Laboratory satellites LES-4 and LES-5 each carry solar cell experiments consisting of the following. VocMeasurement of 10 Ω . cm silicon cell with 30-mil cover slide. IscMeasurement of 10 Ω . cm silicon cell with 30-mil cover slide. IscMeasurement of 10 Ω . cm silicon cell with 6-mil cover slide. IscMeasurement of two CdTe thin-film cells (LES-4 only). IscMeasurement of two CdS thin-film cells (LES-5 only). LES-4 was orbited in December 1965 in a highly elliptical orbit with an 18 000-mi apogee and a 100-mi perigee; LES-5 was injected into a quasi-synchronous orbit in July 1967. In the LES-5 experiment, the Si cells exhibit an Iscdegradation of eight percent per year plus an initial short term degradation of four percent; Vocis relatively unaffected. The CdS cells have an Iscdegradation of 20 percent per year plus an initial degradation of five percent. In the LES-4 experiment, the Si cell with the 6-mil cover slide shows two rates of degradation, with the break point occurring at about 100 days; the cell with the 30-mil cover slide shows substantially less degradation. After 700 days, the short-circuit currents of these two cells are 60 percent and 78 percent of their initial AMO values. One CdTe cell has decayed to 38 percent of its initial AMO value after 700 days; the second sample gives anomalous results. In each experiment AM0 to AM1 short-circuit current ratios of approximately 1.09 were noted."
"The theory of microwave tubes using cyclotron- and synchronous-wave interactions is reviewed, and an analysis is presented of the energy exchange mechanism and the axial-beam velocity spread induced by the RF interactions in transverse-wave traveling-wave tubes. The analysis of the energy spread in a realistic model of the beam shows that the maximum efficiency attainable (with collector depression) is limited by the nonzero size of the beam and the nonzero space-charge density. Considering practical limitations of the beam parameters and the saturation characteristics, possible design parameters for high-efficiency, transverse-wave tubes operating at moderate power levels have been obtained. The attainment of such goals with reasonable circuit length appears possible but difficult, mainly due to relatively low interaction impedance available for transverse-wave interactions."
"A postdeflection acceleration lens (PDAL) for use in high-sensitive fast-writing CRTs is described. The lens achieves a vertical scan magnification of about 2.8 and a horizontal of about 2.2. After a discussion of the principle of operation a detailed investigation of defection linearity and distortion is given. A computer was used to calculate deflection linearity and distortion whereas experimental CRTs were evaluated to establish tube parameters which result in a vertical deflection sensitivity of 3 V/cm and a writing speed of 3 cm/ns."
"The processing steps to build and the operation of a novel complementary device structure are discussed. The device achieves both a six times improvement ing_{m}/C_{g}figure of merit by a 2.5-to-1 reduction in channel length and a packing density on the order of 1 × 105gates/in2as a result of its vertical construction."
"The quartz crystal oscillator is normally thought of as a stable generator of a fixed frequency. It is possible, however, to design and construct voltage tunable quartz crystal oscillators that can be electrically tuned over a frequency range on the order of ±0.3 percent of the crystal frequency. This is accomplished with a nonlinearity between frequency and voltage on the order of 0.1 percent. Moderately good long-term frequency stability and low phase noise is exhibited by the oscillators. A reactive network including varactor diodes is used to provide a voltage variable reactance which, in combination with a quartz crystal network, forms a resonator having an antiresonant frequency that is a linear function of tuning voltage. The basic reactance network is not practically realizable. However, the application of one of Norton's network transformation theorems results in a realizable network. The oscillator described is very simple in design and provides an inexpensive solution to a large number of signal processing and measurement problems."
"The obtainable CW power of silicon IMPATT oscillators, as a function of frequency, is calculated by scaling from reference results. The analysis differs from previous treatments in that the microwave circuit impedance limitation, as observed experimentally, is utilized simultaneously with thermal impedance limitations to uniquely determine device diameter, operating currents, and output power. Results are presented for single and multiple (parallel) units on copper and diamond mounting studs, and for both single (p+-n-n+) and double-drift-region (p+-p-n-n+) structures. Obtainable power falls off essentially as 1/f until an ultimate (nonthermal) space-charge-limited current density is reached. Beyond this point the obtainable power varies as f-2.14. The calculated results on single-drift-region structures are in agreement with experimental observations over the range of frequencies from 13 to 55 GHz, and the analysis predicts an obtainable power of 300 mW at 110 GHz for a double-drift-region structure with 10 percent conversion efficiency."
"A self-consistent one-dimensional large-signal analysis of a Read-type IMPATT diode oscillator has been developed which takes into account the device-circuit interaction. The circuit is modeled by a lumped-equivalent network representing the diode package, and a cascade of lossless transmission lines with discontinuity capacitances representing the coaxial-line cavity with tuning slugs. A particular voltage waveform across the semiconductor wafer is not assumed a priori. Instead, the voltage and current waveforms are determined iteratively until they satisfy the equations for both the diode model and for the circuit. The waveforms are found to be highly dependent upon the circuit in which the diode is embedded."
"In this paper, we have developed a set of guidelines for the design of high-efficiency mode avalanche diode oscillators, based on the previously published theory of this mode. An important feature in the development is the \"design triangle\"--an area in design space which is compatible with the existence of a set of waveforms characterized by efficiencies of up to 60 percent. The particular subregion of the design triangle which is most suitable depends on whether the goal is CW or high-pulsed-power operation. Examination of available data for the highest efficiency oscillators indicates that most of these are likely exhibiting oscillations of the type described and that the quantitative results developed are indeed applicable. In order to achieve extremely high efficiencies, severe circuit demands must be met; doing this systematically is likely to prove quite difficult. Combining the design results with thermal calculations indicates that one may anticipate UHF or L-band single-chip CW power levels of over 20 W with a conventional copper heat sink and considerably more power with a heat sink of type IIA diamond."
"Observations have been made of the relation between temperature and bias-induced frequency variations of CW X-band Gunn oscillators. The results indicate that a large part of the frequency modulation through the bias circuit at modulation frequencies below approximately 1 MHz can be caused by modulation of the device temperature. Other modulation processes also occur."
"A switching phenomenon has been reported in certain lateral geometry transistors in silicon integrated circuits. These devices switch between conducting and nonconducting states at a critical value of VCE. A hypothesis for the mechanism has been proposed. In this paper an equivalent circuit is developed for the switching lateral transistor and is used to predict transistor behavior. The effect of manufacturing tolerances on the device switching voltage is investigated and a technique of production control is proposed. Circuits using the device are described in which the circuit switching voltage may be varied over a wide range. Some applications of the switching lateral transistor, as an overvoltage protection circuit and a relaxation oscillator, are described."
"Degradation of moderate current hFEunder high-temperature reverse bias has been noted in 20-30 percent of the n-p-n transistors examined in this study and this type of degradation is shown to be accompanied by a decrease in neutral region minority carrier lifetime within the active base. It has been found that n-p-n's which have degraded can be partially, and in some instances, completely recovered by increasing VCEOsignificantly beyond BVCEO. P-n-p transistors examined in this study did not exhibit this type of hFEdegradation. This mechanism is distinct from both ionic contamination induced degradation of hFEas well as avalanche degradation of hFEand represents, at present, an unexplained degradation mode for bipolar transistors."
"Exact numerical steady-state solutions are presented for a forward-biased step-junction one-dimensional p+-n-n+rectifier over a current range of 10-2to 104A/cm2The versatility of the numerical approach is demonstrated by the inclusion in the physical model of injection-dependent carrier lifetimes due to Auger recombination or injection-dependent mobilities due to electron-hole scattering. The solutions obtained are compared to those given by conventional analytical treatments at low and high injection levels. Among the major results established are the validity of the Boltzmann's relations and of the quasi-neutrality assumption at all injection levels of interest. It is shown that at the upper end of the current range, a complete analytical solution for the whole device is intractable. However, partial analytical solutions are available for the quasi-neutral regions, and these have enabled us to obtain a better understanding of some of the numerical solutions. Examples are the early onset of non-linearity effects in the n+region because the minority carrier current there is small compared to the total current, and the shift in the minimum of the base carrier distribution towards the n-p+junction as the injection efficiency from the p+region into the base decreases with increasing forward bias."
"Starting from the two-dimensional carrier-wave theory of Kino and Robson the minimum thickness of a semiconductor plate that is able to support an approximate plane wave with the dispersion relation being practically equal to that of the one-dimensional theory is estimated. In the limit of small external permittivity such a plane wave is approximated by the fundamental lateral mode, whereas in the limit of large external permittivity a superposition of a few orders of the lateral modes is necessary. At small plate thickness the fundamental mode stays an approximate plane wave. It does the same for larger external permittivity, however, with a changed dispersion relation."
"A one-dimensional model of a reverse-biased lateral photodetector is analyzed. The effect of background illumination is considered. An ac equivalent circuit for the device is derived. From this equivalent circuit the transient response is calculated and device parameters that determine its characteristics are presented."
"A new kind of three-terminal amplifying device that works on the principle of nonlinear acoustic wave amplification is described. The device has an advantage of simple transistor-like operation while maintaining the long delay times of an acoustic wave amplifier. A piezoelectric semiconductor with three ohmic contacts forms the basic unit; transducers are not required. A theory of device operation, based on a linearized small-signal analysis of acoustic energy transport, is presented along with the resulting analytical expressions for the dc and RF gain and cutoff frequency. Experimental results are given for a test device made of epitaxial GaAs."

  "The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the parameters of display devices that might better serve the needs of highly interactive man-machine systems. Examples of what is meant by \"highly interactive\" are those systems designed to aid editors in the acquisition, correction, and production editing of \"camera-ready\" textual information, assist with the development of design drawings in computer-aided engineering design, and provide for development and management information systems graphic reports that can be interacted with by the user. CRTs are the most versatile and ubiquitous form of display in the machine-to-man communication part of this interface. Two major technical drawbacks to CRTs for this function are the size of the work space and the resolution. To significantly increase either of these greatly increases the costs that are already too high for many applications. For the man-to-machine portion of the interface, the CRT has some undesirable characteristics."
"This paper gives a brief review of the technology and performance of some of the currently interesting light-emitting diodes. Rather more attention is paid to gallium phosphide than to some of the other materials both because of its scientific interest and its potential commercial importance."
"Beam lead GaP electroluminescent diodes have been developed using a quasi-planar configuration. This new structure couples the advantages of beam lead technology to the high-efficiency GaP p-n junctions prepared by liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) growth. The devices consist of a p-type (Zn, O-doped) LPE mesa formed on an n-type (Te-doped) LPE layer grown on an n-type Czochralski-grown substrate. A deposited insulator film covers the entire mesa surface and passivates the exposed junction perimeter. Ohmic contacts are made to both the p- and n-regions through holes in the insulating layer and beam leads are applied by conventional technology. The finished devices are shaped into domed structures during the final separation of the wafer into individual devices. Complete devices bonded to substrates were operated at 10 mA with typical forward voltages of 1.95 ± 0.05 V with external quantum efficiencies of 2-2.25 per cent (unencapsulated). This beam lead quasi-planar structure takes advantage of the inherently large size of the individual devices dictated by optical considerations and allows a number of improvements in device design. The areas where advantages over existing GaP diodes can be realized are as follows, 1) Optimization of external efficiency by contact design and diode configuration is possible. 2) Planar beam lead processing and junction passivation methods can be used, 3) Array fabrication in discrete or monolithic forms is feasible."
"A prototype of a single-line alphanumeric character display system has been designed and built using GaP red electroluminescent diodes in a matrix connection for the display elements and low-power TTL integrated-circuit chips for the memory and logic functions. The display is a dot matrix of 7 rows and 72 columns and the associated shift-register memory is such as to allow great operational flexibility which includes the ability to display characters and symbols of variable width and a \"rolling\" mode of operation, i.e., one column of new display information is introduced periodically at the right end causing the old information to shift one column to the left. Thus, the information travels (rolls) from right to left at reading speed. This type of display system is useful for displaying short transitory messages originating from a remote centralized terminal, e.g., a telephone system in a business environment. The rolling feature allows extended messages to be shown, at reading speed, on a relatively small matrix, and the variable character width makes optimum use of the available display area. The present display serves the purpose of demonstrating feasibility but does not represent an optimum in either technology. A more optimized system using beam-leaded monolithic circuits in both technologies is briefly discussed."
"Display systems that are small in size and require a high density of light-emitting elements can be based on light-emitting diodes. Matrix addressing can be used to minimize the external wires. Interconnections on the display plane can be minimized by the use of a monolithic matrix-addressable display device. A planar processing technique which permits the integration of the light-emitting diode interconnections for a monolithic semiconductor array is presented. The operation of a 5 × 7 monolithic matrix-addressable display device is discussed and demonstrated."
"The device research associated with the development of the plasma display panel at the University of Illinois has provided an understanding of the basic properties of this device and, as a result, has contributed to the formation of a device model which is presently being used to design electronic drive circuitry. This paper provides a description of the device properties of a plasma display element and a description of a model which accounts for the controllability of this bistable element. In addition, the application of this model to the design of display drive systems is discussed."
"The regularity of the pulsed discharges in the plasma display panel is attributed to processes which automatically damp out perturbations from equilibrium conditions. With rectangular wave excitation, these processes are controlled by the dependence of wall voltage changes during a discharge on the cell voltage at the beginning of a discharge. Conditions for stability and instability are derived for both simple series, in which all discharges are identical, and for more complex series of recurrent discharge sequences, for which the discharges within a sequence need not be identical."
"The plasma display panel, in its usual mode, retains information in the form of wall charges that determine whether or not a sequence of discharges will be maintained at a given cell. These discharges are stable in the sense that a perturbation in wall voltage at a particular discharge will damp out over the succeeding discharges. Recent work has shown that a cell in a plasma display panel can exist in one of several states, each with a unique set of wall voltages and each with a unique average intensity. As with the bistable case, each state is stable in the sense that perturbations damp out. Three states have been achieved simultaneously, with brightnesses that can be characterized as bright, medium, and dim. Within the constraints of a simple theoretical model, the conditions for stability can be stated in terms of the products of the slopes of charge transfer curves. This technique for achieving variable intensity retains the advantage, inherent in the plasma display technique, that the information, once imparted to the display, is retained as long as the sustaining signal is applied to the entire panel."
"Gas discharge plasma display panels have been under development at Owens-Illinois for several years. This display device offers many advantages including: 1) tube depth (approximately ½ in) essentially independent of display size; 2) random write capability; 3) controlled information storage; 4) selective erase and bulk erase capability; 5) positive registration of displayed information; and 6) rear projection and/or printout capability. Panels, now available (DIGIVUE® display/memory unit), with 33⅓ and 40 electrode lines per inch are appropriate for many applications. However, a somewhat higher resolution of 50 or 60 lines per inch is desired for most general-purpose individual console displays when the number of lines inXor inYexceeds several hundred. The lower density Owens-Illinois panels are constructed from a parallel plate structure that was selected because of its compatibility with high volume manufacturing processing. This study indicated that the same basic structure could be used at resolutions up to 60 lines per inch. Design dimensions were optimized for this higher resolution and good dynamic operation was obtained. Process techniques were developed to produce panels with 256 by 256 lines and 512 by 512 lines. Several panels of each of these sizes were fabricated and evaluated. The performance of these 60 line per inch panels was comparable to that of the 33 line per inch panels."
"Techniques of changing the state of plasma display cells with externally applied light are presented. Optical write-in offers the advantage of high-speed parallel data transfer from a photographic transparency to a plasma display panel. It is established that light incident on a plasma cell causes a photoemission from the inner glass surface. The emitted electrons perturb the wall voltage and cause a change in state. The intensity of light needed to change the state of cells can be reduced, without changing the solid panel materials, by two techniques, Electron avalanches initiated by the photoelectrons can be used to decrease the light needed by a factor of 100. By flashing light during the plasma display cell gas discharge, the intensity of the light can be further reduced."
"Display devices using nematic liquid crystal materials offer advantages over other display media in low-voltage low-power operation, cost of materials and fabrication methods, electrical compatibility with MOS drive circuits, and flexibility of character size and format. This paper describes liquid crystal display devices that utilize dynamic scattering to modify transmitted or reflected light. We have synthesized individual materials that have nematic temperature ranges as large as -15-115°C without super-cooling effects at low temperatures. When these materials are used in transmissive displays having liquid crystal layers 12 µm thick sandwiched between transparent electrodes, contrast ratios of 30:1 to 50:1 are realized at 10-40 V dc or ac with a current density of ∼1-10 µA/cm2. Turn-on times are 10-50 ms and turn-off times are 30-100 ms, precise values being dependent on the specific material, temperature, and voltage used. The contrast ratio versus voltage exhibits a threshold so that it may be possible to matrix address liquid crystal display panels. Operating lifetime and display applications are also discussed."
"The development of the CRT in response to many new application fields which have arisen in recent years has resulted in a proliferation of tube designs with a correspondingly broad extension of the overall technology. The state of the art of available electron-beam peak power and number of available resolution elements is reviewed together with a discussion of deflection speeds and limitations. New and improved luminescent and cathodoluminescent materials are described and discussed including the current status of color screen techniques. Envelope materials and fabrication techniques are examined with special attention drawn to the versatility of envelope designs resulting from frit sealing techniques. A brief discussion of activity in the fields of contrast preservation and tube reliability concludes the paper."
"Cathodochromic dark-trace tubes using KC1 as the screen material have been built for at least three decades. Recently developed cathodochromic sodalite materials give improved storage-display tube performance over the standard KC1 tubes. The induced cathodochromic coloration in both sodalite and KC1 is the result of F-center absorption. A limitation of KC1 is that after repeated and prolonged exposure color-center aggregation occurs. Unlike KC1, however, in sodalite each F-center is located in an aluminosilicate cage. These cages shield the F-centers from each other, and, therefore, color-center aggregation does not occur. Furthermore, in the optically reversible coloration region, the cathodochromic sensitivity is higher and the contrast range is larger in sodalite than in KC1. A more intense image can be obtained that is erasable thermally but not optically. The maximum contrast ratio attainable in this manner is also greater in sodalite than in KC1. Experimental self-contained storage-display tubes employing sodalite:Br as the dark-trace cathodochromic screen material operating in the permanent coloration thermal-erase mode have been constructed. State-of-the-art cathodochromic materials produce white-light reflective contrast ratios in excess of 10:1, and have storage times that are measured in months. Full-frame erase times of less than 2 s have been measured for erase powers of about 12 W/in2."
"A unique alphanumeric display has been developed which utilizes several digitally addressed electron beams to write characters on a conventional phosphor target. The electron beams are generated by an areal electron source, followed by a series of thin dynode plates containing any array of holes. The plates act collectively to control the flow of electrons spatially, so that several electron beams from certain holes in the last plate at discrete positions determined by the digital addressing signals. This device incorporates the features of flat-panel construction, digital address, simplified electronics, multibeam operation, and low power. In addition, the concept is applicable to multicolor operation, gray scale modulation, and graphics presentations. The principles of operation of a 64-character display (8 rows of 8 characters per row) are discussed in detail. In addition, the actual operational characteristics of a 176-character DIGISPLAY® are given, along with an analysis of the power requirements of this display."
"In a color picture tube using an in-line arrangement of three beams and the conventional shadow mask, the transmission of the shadow mask must be made very low in the corner regions in order to avoid the overlapping of adjacent in-line trios of landed beam dots on the screen. An improved design of aperture alignment on a shadow mask was developed for the in-line three beams in order to avoid this overlapping without reducing the transmission. In this new shadow mask, the apertures are aligned not along straight lines as in the conventional shadow mask but along certain curved lines. The horizontal aperture alignment curves are a barrel-shaped group of arcs of ellipses, and the vertical aperture alignment curves are a pin-cushioned group of arcs of circles. Brightness and color purity of the picture in the corner regions of the screen were much improved by using this shadow mask."
"Though the beam-indexing color television display has some obvious advantages when compared with other display systems, the electron-optical demands are very high. First, these demands and the imaging system to be used are discussed. It turns out that the beam must be astigmatic to obtain optimum performance. The beam shape is prescribed by the deflection-coil design. This beam shape, giving rise to a vertically elongated spot of sufficiently small dimensions, is obtained by using an astigmatic gun of special design in combination with a simple rotation-symmetrical focusing lens. After a general discussion of the focusing properties of this combination, the intensity distributions along both the minor and the major axis of the spot on the screen are calculated and compared with experiments. The gamma of the beam current characteristic is measured as well as calculated. Its dependence on the beam current is small up to beam currents of about 3 mA. Moreover, the cathode loading is calculated as a function of the beam current. Without special means of dynamic correction, satisfactory color reproduction in normal picture material is obtained up to peak currents of 1.5 mA in 110°-25 in tubes. Higher beam currents would be attainable in the absence of a residual deflection error which causes a tilt of the spot near the corners of the screen. The structure of the picture is quite acceptable at a triplet pitch of 1.2 mm without using a lenticular screen."
"Typically, dry-process-recording media is sensitive only in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum, where current phosphors and faceplate glasses are either inadequate or unavailable. Thus, it was considered necessary to develop new phosphors and fiber-optic faceplates for incorporation in high-resolution cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) to be used for these dry-process real-time-recording applications. Two rugged UV phosphors, which emit radiation centered near 320 nm and 380 nm, are joined with newly developed fiber-optic faceplates to produce CRTs that may be used to write on almost any of the mentioned recording media. Up to tenfold improvement in writing speed on appropriate media is shown to be possible."
"Operational characteristics are presented for several CRT phosphor screens which exhibit shifts in emission chromaticity with changes in screen current density at a constant accelerating voltage. One type of screen utilizes a single phosphor, whereas another type comprises a mixture of two phosphors which differ in chromaticity and in the dependence of their luminance on current density. The most promising screens combine a phosphor having a sublinear luminance-current density relationship with one having superlinear behavior and produce color shifts from yellowish green to orange. By matching filters having absorption bands in selected spectral regions to the current-sensitive screens, it is possible to enhance both the contrast and the chromaticity shift."
"A new three-dimensional (3D) display concept is described that employs a random accessed flying spot in a transparent volume of material viewable from any position outside the volume. Arbitrary, true 3D figures may be presented ranging from line to full surface drawings and including alphanumerics. The display has a multicolor capability, continuously variable intensity, and can exhibit fixed or moving objects with good resolution. Display volumes of several cubic feet with high information capacity seem feasible."
"Cholophors are passive polarization-switched color display elements suitable for use with lasers or white light. Their hybrid structure, consisting of a thin layer of cholesteric liquid crystal over a layer of photoluminescent phosphor, provides properties of particular interest for large-screen optically scanned multicolor display applications. Cholophors permit more efficient use of available laser power while providing a solution to the problem of color registration for two-primary displays and a partial solution for three-primary displays. Two-primary or Land-color displays can be obtained with only one color of laser light and three-primary displays with only two colors. A three-primary cholophor display using a single argon ion laser would have over 7 times the efficiency of a typical state-of-the-art system using an argon-krypton mixed-gas laser. The liquid crystal layer provides polarization selectivity, and the phosphor layer produces the additional color not furnished by the laser. The liquid crystal transmits one sense of laser polarization while totally reflecting the other, thereby permitting polarization selective excitation of the underlying phosphor. The color selection information is coded into the polarization of the incident laser beam."
"The Lumatron is a high-resolution storage and projection display device that separates the functions of light generation and modulation that are combined in the normal CRT or DVST. The modulation function is achieved in a single vacuum chamber by the formation of a depth-modulated diffraction pattern in a deformable medium with a fine electrostatically focused and deflected electron beam. The illumination function is provided by a single-lens schlieren optical system external to the vacuum. The electron beam and light paths in the Lumatron are coaxial and the maximum voltage required by the device is 7.5 kV. Permanent storage and continuous readout without degradation for more than 24 h is possible, and yet the stored information can be intentionally erased in less than 1 s. Resolution in excess of 1800 TV lines/in at the storage surface has been measured and full 10-step grey scales have been stored and projected. Once an image is stored in a Lumatron, the only power required to generate the display is that required by the light source. In a demountable version of the projector, the storage surface can be easily removed and the stored pattern displayed in a remote schlieren projector without degradation."
"Recent developments in the solid-state light valve promise a high-quality projection display. The heart of the solid-state light valve is a cathode-ray tube which operates with a modulated and scanning write beam depositing charge on an electrooptic crystal target. The charge pattern on the target causes optical changes which result in modulation of an external light source. The tube incorporates an erase flood gun to control persistence of the display. This paper discusses an unique reflected light configuration with the target operating at reduced temperature and illustrates the resulting image performance. Accomplishments of contracts with Isomet Corporation on crystal targets of KD2P (potassium dideuterium phosphate) and with EDO, Ltd., on isomorphs of KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) are included. Work being performed by the National Bureau of Standards on crystal perfection and electrode interaction is also presented. The paper concludes with a brief summary of various applications of the solid-state light valve concept, and a short synopsis of results obtained by others that support our enthusiasm for the device."
"Bistable light valves comprising single crystal gadolinium molybdate have been proposed which utilize either the interchange of fast and slow directions in c-cut plates or the alteration of extinction directions in oblique sections upon ferroelectric switching. Several device configurations of each type are analyzed for brightness and contrast as functions of crystallographic orientation and thickness of the ferroelectric plate. The results facilitate quantitative comparisons among devices and predict the sacrifice in optical performance incurred when thickness is reduced to lower the drive voltage required for switching. For equivalent optical performance, the switching voltage should be 43 percent higher in valves of the extinction-direction type. The analysis predicts that no oblique section exists for which display brightness at maximum contrast is higher than that obtainable on a c-cut section of equal thickness."
"Three previously proposed methods of optically detecting ferroelectric domains in bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) are reviewed and the merits of each discussed. A fourth method which is introduced involves a tilt of a natural crystal plate about the b axis and utilizes the difference in birefringence between domains. The major advantages of the new read method are its high efficiency and contrast and its insensitivity to the optical degradation or \"depoling\" which occurs after repeated polarization reversals. Resolution test patterns written into Bi4Ti3O12crystals via a photoconductor film show up to 90 lines/mm resolution. In addition, photographic images have been stored, demonstrating a gray-scale capability."
"An image-sensing and memory device is described that photoconductively converts and electrostatically stores optical images at the interface between a UV sensitive ZnS film and an associated blocking electrode. Optical readout is accomplished by means of the Pockels electrooptic effect generated in the ZnS film by the electrostatic image. A high ratio of UV to visible photosensitivity (approximately 105:1 between 340 and 630 nm) allows pseudonondestructive readout of the stored image pattern. A device has been constructed and tested having an active sensing and storage area of 2 cm2with an observed limiting resolution of 85 line pairs/mm. A 340-nm exposure of 20 erg/cm2gives a 2:1 change in readout light intensity (100 erg/cm2gives a 10:1 change). Dark storage periods of approximately 100 h have been observed under room temperature conditions. The device can be erased electrically or optically and recycled. The device structure will be described along with the theory of operation in the sensing, storing, and readout modes. The lumped parameter equivalent circuit models and the equations that predict device performance will be discussed. This device is applicable as a reusable memory plane for use in coherent processors. It has been evaluated for this use by storing phase gratings and measuring their diffraction efficiency. Such operations as real-time correlation, Fourier transformation, and spatial filtering are made possible by this device."
"The display properties of previously described strain-biased ferroelectric-photoconductor devices that operate in a transmission projection mode can be improved by operating them in a double-pass or reflection mode in which the reading light is reflected off an opaque interface between the ceramic and the photoconductor. Such an arrangement offers better resolution (because of the thinner ceramic), isolation between reading and writing light, and greater flexibility in the choice of photoconductor, which need not be transparent to the reading light. Simple reflection mode structures have been fabricated that use either PVK or CdS photoconductive layers and show a resolution of 250 lines/in."
"A new electron beam recording medium is reported. The medium is well suited for use in a high resolution recorder with near-real-time display capability. The development time can be less than 1 s. Black-on-white images are produced on the opaque tape with a contrast of 15:1 by exposure with 1 × 1011electrons/cm2for a peak density of 1.3. The resolution of the medium exceeds 500 line pairs/mm, and the granularity is very low. Another feature of the medium allows the recorded information to be read out directly from the tape with a scanning electron beam. The latent image is produced by a process termed nucleation. Electron bombardment of the tape produces nucleation sites which are extremely favorable deposition sites for metal vapor atoms. Development takes place in the vacuum, immediately after electron beam recording, by selectively depositing a thin metal film which forms the image. The developed image is permanent and does not degrade under further electron beam bombardment or high intensity projection lamps. Recordings of 945-line television with a 20 MHz bandwidth have been made with an electron beam recorder, which was constructed for evaluating the media. An opaque projector was also constructed for projecting 35 mm images from the tape to a large screen display."
"The difference between forecast approaches of technologists and economists is that the technologist looks at the trends in new techniques and assumes that fund will be available to support the necessary research and development, while the economist looks at total sales and assumes that technical advancements will occur which will permit high productivity and the development of new products. A rational forecast, which may not be any more correct, uses the inputs from both sectors to define the constraints for the support of research and development and production and then attempts to develop the time scale which new techniques and devices must satisfy in order to be successful. The conclusions reached are: 1) determine whether your research and development programs are directed toward new or substitution programs; 2) determine the potential markets and the market share you are seeking; and 3) set deadlines for product introduction and from this decide research budget and manpower requirements. In each step there is risk, since old technologies do not stand still, competitors are also taking risks, and new markets may not develop as predicted. For flat screen displays, limited markets are now developing, but large-scale consumer TV use is not expected for about ten years. The display of 1980 will probably not include the technologies now being researched. However, in the display area where we know there will be continuing needs for television and computer terminals, and where new products have developed new markets, I am optimistic that the research will pay."
"High-definition, random access, coordinate display devices need a fast electronic selection system. The selection system discussed here employs submatrices of linear transformers selected by low-power transistor circuitry and provides pulses of defined voltage of either sign and specified duration."
"Matrix displays using electrically symmetrical elements cannot have many columns driven simultaneously unless all the electrodes are terminated in low impedances. If the undriven electrodes are allowed to float, elements which should be off will produce undesired outputs. Matrices of asymmetrical devices like junction diodes are less subject to this limitation on the driving circuitry."
"The most important properties of phosphors used in mixed phosphor screens for current-sensitive color CRTs are emission linearity, luminance, chromaticity, spectral energy distribution, and stability. The evaluation of experimental phosphors can be readily carried out in a demountable CRT system but precautions must be taken to minimize possible errors. In order to eliminate much of the trial-and-error evaluation of phosphor mixtures, an equation has been derived which can be used to calculate the ratio of two phosphors which will give the maximum color shift from measurements on the individual phosphors. Good correlation has been obtained between measured and calculated color shifts."
"A single ultrasonic cell carrying acoustic oscillations of many frequencies can deflect parallel light simultaneously in the many directions corresponding to these frequencies. When focused, the light beams form a line of spots corresponding to the acoustic spectrum. This correspondence proposes that the line of spots could usefully correspond to a line of television information, since each spot can be independently modulated in intensity. Frame scanning such a modulating line produces a complete picture. The system's Fourier transform properties will cause noise interference and multipath propagation effects to be displayed in forms differing from those found in conventional serial transmission. A real image is available for video recording on film."
"In a survey of the total systems aspects for a flat-panel electroluminescent display, it is shown that an EL-TV panel is feasible. This is based on the use of address and drive circuitry characterized by a large-area thin-film transistor (TFT) matrix deposited directly onto the back of the EL layer. Low-voltage dc EL would be most desirable, and a new II-VI polycrystalline heterojunction principle (semibarrier injection EL) to accomplish this is proposed. However, existing ac EL can be used, pending some improvements."

"The emitter efficiency current gain βγis calculated taking into account the effect of the bandgap decrease caused by heavy doping of the emitter. It is found that this effect reduces the emitter efficiency and explains experimental results on the temperature dependence of the current gain. It also predicts an optimum emitter doping for a given base doping."
"A detailed examination has been carried out on the characteristics of transferred electron microwave oscillators constructed from epitaxial indium phosphide. Seven slices have been used, for which the layer thicknesses varied between 5.4 and 28 µm. It is shown that the mechanism of oscillation has a transit-time dependence and that the transit velocity which emerges (1.5-2 × 107cm/s) is approximately the same as the peak electron drift velocity. It is therefore concluded that propagating space-charge layers are responsible for the oscillations. However, in view of the high transit velocities involved, it is unlikely that the space-charge layers are well-formed dipolar domains. Despite the transit-time dependence, individual devices have been made to oscillate over very wide frequency ranges (8-28 GHz). Operation of devices at frequencies up to 40 GHz has established the high-frequency capability of the oscillators. The best pulsed results obtained have included 0.5 W, 6.3 percent at 13.8 GHz; 1.05 W, 4.2 percent at 18.0 GHz and 0.65 W, 2.6 percent at 25.0 GHz. Continuous operation of these diodes has not yet been possible due to material and thermal technology limitations."
"The microwave performance of planar Gunn oscillators operating in X band has been examined. CW output powers have been limited to 23 mW (2 percent) by high device temperatures. Thermal limitations have been included with space-charge limitations in an examination of the design requirements for planar oscillators and a chart has been drawn up to identify the allowable ranges of epitaxial layer parameters."
"An analysis of the current flow in a mesa diode shows that this diode suffers from similar limitations in breakdown voltage as the planar diode due to radial current flow at the diode edge. A theoretical analysis of the breakdown voltage of this structure shows that careful tailoring of the doping profile is essential to obtain bulk breakdown in IMPATT and TRAPATT mesa diodes. Experimental results from a great number of wafers strongly support this theoretical model. Band bending at the surface or microplasmas due to point defects do not satisfactorily explain the too low or badly defined breakdowns observed in our mesa diodes."
"The integral method of solving Laplace's or Poisson's equation results in a formulation for solution which is suitable for directly calculating the change in the domain potentials due to displacing the domain boundaries. Specifically, the order and locations remain the same for the matrix ∂Φ/∂x i.e., the change in potential per boundary change, which is required for the optimum design problem."
"A theory of wave propagation through semiconductors, assuming general orientations of the carrier drift velocities, the propagation vector, and the RF electric field relative to an applied steady magnetic field, is derived. This is specialized to obtain a theory of pseudolongitudinal wave interactions in electron and hole streams in InSb in a transverse and in a parallel (or zero) magnetic field. The theory explains the various features of high electric-field microwave emission and RF oscillations observed by experimenters over several years in a wide variety of material conditions and field configurations. Explained in particular are the facts that: 1) starting n- or p-type materials with initial density ≲ 1014cm-3have to be impact ionized to achieve electron or hole number densities adequate for microwave emission; 2) for impact-ionized plasmas, it takes a minimum transverse magnetic field (B\\perp) on the order of 1.5-2.5 kG for the onset of microwave emission and the threshold current thereafter diminishes monotonically with increasingB\\perp; 3) p-type material with high enough initial density (nh≳ 1 - 3 × 1015cm-3) is unstable with electron injecting contacts in the presence of 15-20 percent (or more) electron injection; and 4) in the absence ofB\\perp, a longitudinal magnetic field is necessary mainly to prevent pinching of the plasma at the high current densities needed for microwave emission, etc. RF oscillations observed in n- and p-type InSb with or withoutB\\perpare also explained. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on the magnitude ofB\\perpshows a remarkable correlation with experimental observations."
"GaAs devices verify practical LSA mode operation at V-band frequencies (50-75 GHz). The limitations on power and efficiency are characterized including the dependence of efficiency on electron concentration. The maximum CW power level is 62 mW with an efficiency of 2.2 percent at 64 GHz. The peak power and efficiency is 137 mW and 3.71 percent at 64 GHz for 5 percent duty, pulsed operation. A maximum in the CW efficiency occurs at an n/f ratio of 1.1 × 105s . cm-3corresponding to a doping of 6.6 × 1015cm-3for a frequency of 60 GHz. Device design curves are presented for CW operation subject to Copeland's LSA mode criteria and to a maximum allowed sample temperature rise. Details of a vane circuit are presented which provide V-band resonances and a proper RF environment for LSA-related operation."
"A prism fiber reading tube (PFT) for fast facsimile has been developed. It features a new type of prism-shaped glass fiber which makes direct contact reading possible. This newly developed tube is capable of reading opaque original manuscripts, a procedure not possible with an ordinary fiber-optics tube. By electronic scanning, a manuscript can be read at television scanning speeds. The resolution obtained is about 10 lines/mm and the light efficiency is about 5 times as high as that of a conventional flying-spot scanner using an f/1.8 lens with unity magnification."
"On silicon diodes possessing a base width to minority carrier diffusion length ratio around one and aluminum-alloyed contacts, a dependence of storage times from absolute values of forward and reverse currents is observed which can be described by a constant leakage current. To explain this phenomena it is not possible to characterize this type of contact with a single recombination velocity. A formal proof is given by a modification of the Kuno treatment of this problem and the diode behavior is represented by an equivalent circuit consisting of a long-base diode and a resistor in parallel. In addition the lifetimes after Kuno and Kingston are compared."
"In a practical metal semiconductor Schottky barrier diode there is a certain amount of current flow by indirect tunneling through the barrier. Although this component of current is negligibly small compared to the thermionic emission or thermionic field emission current, a large low-frequency 1/f noise is associated with this multistep tunneling process. The multistep tunneling current introduces a random fluctuation of charge density at the trap states, which trap current carriers during the indirect tunneling process, in the space-charge region of the diode. The field intensity at the metal semiconductor interface is therefore modulated, which in turn modulates the Schottky effect and produces a random fluctuation of the diode current. The spectral intensity of noise due to this mechanism is calculated. Large flicker noise is expected at low frequencies."
"By careful processing MOS transistors have been fabricated with a low value of the interface states density (2 × 1010/cm2eV). Consequently the1/fnoise in these devices is low and in the same order of magnitude as for junction FETs. The experimental values of the equivalent noise voltage and the equivalent noise current are compared to an expression derived from straight physical arguments. From the comparison it is concluded that the noise equivalent voltage in saturated operation is proportional to the effective gate voltage, the interface state density, and inversely proportional to the gate input capacitance. Moreover, it is concluded that a proper heat treatment not only reduces the number of states but also removes the near bandedge peaks, which usually appear in the trap distribution function."
"A circular waveguide periodically loaded with dielectric disks forms a slow wave structure which can be used in a traveling wave tube. For solid disks, the field pattern in the guide can be determined exactly and the characteristics of the structure, when used as a traveling wave tube, can be predicted using Pierce's small signal theory. The gain, bandwidth, operating frequency, and required beam voltage have been calculated for a wide range of structure dimensions. The power capability of the disk-loaded guide is also discussed."
"A normal mode expansion for the analysis of acoustic-wave problems is given. The expansion is based on orthogonality relations between the modes of an acoustic wave, and makes it possible to relate the perturbation and propagation constant of a particular mode to the properties of the modes of the unperturbed system, and of the perturbation. The use of the general expansions is then demonstrated by using it to determine a variational expression of an interdigital transducer. The results obtained are very similar to those of Smith, and demonstrate the connection between the crossed-field and series formulations for the transducer impedance."
"A Rayleigh acoustic wave traveling on the surface of a semi-infinite piezoelectric medium may be amplified by interaction with drifting carriers in an adjacent semiconductor. The gain and frequency response of this interaction is determined here by using a normal mode expansion of the Rayleigh wave piezoelectric fields. The configuration which uses a thin semiconductor film supported by a semi-infinite dielectric and separated from the piezoelectric by a small air gap is described in detail and the results are expressed in a form that clearly shows the effect of piezoelectric, air gap, and semiconductor parameters. Comparisons with experimental data for the lithium niobate-silicon film configuration show that acoustic gains on the order of 100 dB/cm can be obtained in the frequency range above 0.1 GHz."
"A high-power hydrogen thyratron grid-anode structure has been developed using a 5949 thyratron cathode assembly. One such device was operated for 10 h at 2000 A, 32 kV, at 1400 pps with a pulse width of 0.3 µs. Another was operated for periods up to 220 h at 1000 A, 100 kV, at a duty cycle of 0.00004. The duty cycle is presently limited by our test modulator circuit. Trigger requirements are 2 kV at 50 Ω with a 2.5-µs duration. The jitter was nil when measured with a Tektronix 517 oscilloscope using a sweep speed of 50 ns/cm. The anode delay time is in the range of 1/4 to 1/2/ µs. The grid-anode geometry is designed for a minimum anode-grid capacity, thus providing a tube with a higher repetition rate capability. The field emission limit up to 100 kV is not evident in the normal sense in this geometry."
"An analysis has been carried out on a lower sideband parametric up-converter to determine the values of the source and load resistances and frequency ratio giving minimum noise figure at a specified value of gain. A similar analysis has been conducted for maximum gain-bandwidth product. The design requirements for minimum noise figure are found to differ from those for maximum gain-bandwidth product. A study is made of the effect of variation in the design parameter values on noise figure and bandwidth, from which it is concluded that maximum gain-bandwidth design is generally to be preferred for cases where both low noise figure and wide bandwidth are important."
"In this paper p-channel self-registered Mo gate MOSFET fabrication techniques are described and tested. Excellent p-channel devices resulted. Device characteristics including junction characteristics, threshold, stability, effective channel mobilities, and Si-SiO2interface studies are examined and compared with theoretical predictions. Simple processing steps yielded FETs whose threshold is predictably controlled by the intrinsic properties of Mo and the Si-SiO2system. Effective mobility theory matches the data at low fields, but at high fields theory predicts values that are too low. Similarly constructed integrated circuits are T2L compatible with excellent threshold reproducibility and exhibit stability during accelerated temperature-bias life testing."
"The time evolution of the charge transfer during one half-cycle of operation of an IGFET bucket-brigade dynamic shift register is calculated analytically for a smooth but otherwise arbitrary voltage driving function. Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) solutions to the charge transfer equation are matched to Airy-function solutions in the current cutoff region to determine the charge transferred as a function of initial charge. This directly gives several contributions to the incomplete transfer parameter α, the rate of change of the charge left behind on transfer with the initial charge. Although the increment of charge not completely transferred is less than 1 percent of the charge comprising the signal, the calculation is done so that no subtraction of nearly equal large numbers is necessary. We do not evaluate the actual loss of charge due to leakage, traps, recombination, etc. It is found that the finite dynamic drain conductance of an IGFET makes a major contribution to the parameter α, and that under many experimental conditions it will limit shift-register performance. It is also found that all contributions to α depend on the clock-voltage wave-form. Comparison is made with the results of preliminary experiments, and good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement is obtained."
"A two-dimensional ferroelectric memory array is combined with a piezoelectric interrogation technique to provide a memory device with nonvolatile storage, random access, non-destructive readout and compatibility with integrated circuits. Binary information is stored as either a positive or negative polarization state in ferroelectric ceramic material and is read out by sensing the polarity of the piezoelectric response of the material. Calculations and experimental results are presented for a 5 word × 5 bits per word prototype device for which a complete logic and driving circuit has been designed and used. Switching characteristics, disturb pulse sensitivity, and changes with temperature are presented. Calculations show that word-to-word capacitive coupling will affect the maximum size of the memory and will probably limit the number of words per chip to approximately 25. No such limit exists on the number of bits per word."
"This paper considers the influence of several parameters on the current through a nematic liquid crystal cell. The dependence of the current on the average fieldV/d, whereVis the voltage anddthe thickness of the nematic film, does not prove the existence of Schottky emission or field-assisted dissociation. We have measured the electric field distribution in a thick cell containing the nematic. There is an appreciable cathode fall where the electric field is much higher than the average value. Our experiments, made under dc conditions, suggest that the theory of unipolar-injection-induced instability is correct."
"The doping profile of a semiconductor is given only approximately by the conventional analysis ofC-Vmeasurements. The present study employs computer simulation of semiconductors with one-sided doping profiles that consist of high and low doped sections joined by steps and linear ramps. The computation yields the apparent doping profile that would be obtained by the conventional use ofC-Vdata, and this result is compared with the actual profile, with the majority-carrier distribution, and with the outcome of a correction previously proposed in the literature. The results show that a step in the profile cannot be resolved satisfactorily to less than several Debye lengths corresponding to the doping on the high side of the profile. A ramp cannot be distinguished accurately from a step unless its width is appreciably greater than a Debye length. Furthermore, the apparent doping profile is not identical with the majority-carrier distribution with contacts far away, as has been suggested, and the discrepancy is shown to depend on the side from which depletion is done."
"A new method of thermal resistance measurement is presented. The variation of diode breakdown voltage with input power as a function of time is the basis of the method. Diode space-charge resistance and series resistance together with separate components of heat-flow resistance are measured using this method. The technique of the measurement is straightforward and provides results with little ambiguity and high accuracy."
"We have observed inductance effects as well as current-controlled switching in oxidized vanadium foils at room temperature. The inductance was found to be strongly dependent upon dc bias current, but independent of frequency. For the case of zero dc bias, inductances in excess of 100 mH were observed; however, theQof the structure was quite low."
"It is shown that, contrary to the statements in the above paper, the secondary emission yield of thermally grown SiO2does not saturate. Rather, the results reported fall on a yield curve which peaks at a yield of 7.4 at a primary electron energy of 500 eV."
"Klaassen has given two different formulas for the thermal noise in the conducting channel of FETs in the hot electron regime. It is shown that the first published formula is formally correct. A discussion is given of the equivalent noise temperature of the hot electrons."

 "In this paper some of the parameters relevant to the design of charge-coupled imaging devices are considered. Among these are charge storage capability, transfer efficiency, charge conservation, dark current, and the anticipated signal-to-noise ratio. Each is discussed, and the resultant effects on the performance of imaging devices are investigated."
"The design and fabrication of a 96-element 3-phase linear charge-coupled device are described. A transfer efficiency of ∼95 percent over 288 transfers at a 1-MHz clock rate was measured. The use of the device as an analog delay line is demonstrated and its imaging properties are illustrated with reproductions of black and white text and a picture with gray scale. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using self-scanned imaging devices in practical applications. Configurations are presented for both an improved linear and an area imaging device. In both cases the problem of image smear, which occurs if stored charge is transferred along the light-sensitive region and if significant light integration takes place during this transfer, can be avoided."
"Solid-state image sensors which are internally scanned by charge transfer offer a potentially usefull alternative to sensors based onx-yaddressing. The application of charge transfer to solid-state scanning introduces sensor design problems which are common to either the \"bucket-brigade\" or \"charge-coupled\" approach. Two-dimensional and single-line sensors employing bucket-brigade scanning have been built and evaluated. Problems discussed include transfer efficiency, video signal extraction, vertical scanning, and spurious effects. The use of the bucket-brigade shift register as a scan generator forx-yaddressing is also described."
"A new configuration of the capacitor-photodiode type of image sensor is described which results in appreciable reduction of switching transients at the sensor's output. The modification consists of replacing the photodiode by a phototransistor operating in the common base configuration. A 32 × 32 element array capable of operating in either the photodiode or phototransistor mode was fabricated. The dynamic range, transfer characteristic, and switching transient voltage were calculated for both modes and compared with experiment. For the experimental array an order-of-magnitude improvement in signal-to-noise ratio has been realized in the transistor mode of operation."
"A scanning infrared image converter is described in which the line scanning is performed by sampling of the signals from a one-dimensional array of identical detectors, thus eliminating the need for a fast mechanical line scanning device. Gallium-doped silicon acting as an extrinsic photoconductor at an operating temperature of 4°K has been chosen as a detector material. A temperature resolution of 0.1-0.2°C at a speed of 50 frames/s is obtained with the apparatus. This limitation of the resolution can be ascribed to errors in the gain adjustment of the preamplifiers, the noise equivalent temperature difference of the detectors being much lower than the experimental temperature resolution value."
"Typical performance characteristics for intensified silicon vidicon tubes are given. The tube can be operated at 5 × 10-7_ fc faceplate illumination. A 40 percent modulation depth at 400 TV lines per raster height has been achieved at a 300-nA signal level. When operating at 200-nA signal, typical decay lag performance shows less than 20-nA signal 50 ms after the illumination is removed. Theoretical and experimental performance at low light levels are compared. The design of the electron optical system of the intensifier section is considered with respect to distortion and center and edge resolution. Two important target parameters, collection efficiency and resolution, are also considered theoretically and experimentally. A simple model for the collection efficiency is given; theory and experiment compare well. The effect on resolution of discrete diode spacing and target thickness is given and this is coupled with other modulation transfer parameters to predict the overall modulation transfer of the device. Critical performance characteristics are given for sample tubes."
"A low-light-level television camera tube has been realized, which incorporates a silicon electron multiplication (SEM) target. Image electrons liberated from the photocathode bombard the target, causing an electronic amplification of several thousand, as well as electronic charge storage. The SEM tube shows a limiting sensitivity at photocathode illumination on the order of 10-5lx, and approaches the picture degradation problem due to quantum fluctuation. Further degradation of the picture is observed by addition of an image intensifier tube to the SEM tube, and also in the case of an X-ray image pickup using the SEM camera with phosphor screen. The SEM tube can scarcely be injured by the exposure to a strong light."
"A theoretical model for target gain of electron-excited silicon diode array targets is developed. Its validity is established by comparison with experimental data and it is then used to study the gain dependence on n+layer, \"dead\" layer thickness, surface recombination velocity, lifetime, target thickness, and electron energy. Because the theory deals directly with the \"dead\" layer, the n+diffusion region and the built-in electric field rather than utilizing the concept of an effective surface recombination velocity, it allows a physical insight into the effects of the various target parameters on target gain. Conditions for maximum gain are established as well as those necessary for particular gain curves such as might be desired for variable image section gain operation."
"The structure and processing of epitaxial silicon diode array targets for vidicon camera tubes are described with emphasis on the way they differ from conventional silicon diode array targets. These targets, called Epicon™vidicon targets, are generally similar to other silicon vidicon targets, but have the p-type boron diffused islands replaced by pyramidal or mesa-like structures that extend through the oxide apertures and up and over the oxide. The target is a self-registered conducting cap-type structure and does not require a resistive sea for its operation. It has some additional advantages in its structure and its processing over the other silicon diode array target. A comparison of the results of some selective epitaxy processes is briefly made. Some of the operating characteristics of the tube are described."
"The use of silicon phototransistor arrays as high gain targets in vidicon camera tubes is shown to provide a sensitivity advantage. An analysis of device operating parameters indicates that signal enhancement can be obtained during both the write and read portions of an array element's duty cycle. Maximum effective signal amplification is secured by choosing a design which recharges the collector-base storage capacitance mostly during the read interval. Expressions for the effective signal gain in terms of transistor common base current gains and elemental capacitances have been derived, and the effects of phototransistor operation on vidicon sensitivity, image persistence, and dynamic range have been considered. Experimental transistor arrays have been fabricated and have been used for the first successful demonstration of phototransistor signal gain under the usual conditions of vidicon operation. Signal gains exceeding 70 have been recorded."
"The transient response of television camera tubes to changing levels of illumination is examined. When the entire transient occurs within the exponential retarding potential region of the electron beamI-Vcharacteristic and photoconductive lag can be neglected, exact analytical expressions describing the rise and decay of video signal levels are established. The author present separate solutions to the problem based on the assumptions of electron beam scanning and charging by a hypothetical defocused beam (uniform charging case). The results support arguments in favor of target current biasing to minimize lag and turn-on time. We also show the effects of scanning as opposed to continuous dwelling by a flood beam. The decay transient is shown to be universial in the sense that it is independent of the initial signal strength and depends only on physical tube parameters. The validity of the expression describing signal decay is confirmed experimentally for a silicon diode array vidicon and a return beam silicon diode array vidicon. The effect on the resolution of target surface conductivity in conjunction with a finite electron beam impedance is treated for a steady-state per pattern and isolated circular spot illumination. In particular, the strong dependance of resolution, as limited by a conducting target surface, on operating current level is described. Lateral target leakage is shown to offer little advantage in decreasing lag."
"A high sensitivity vidicon using a CdSe photoconductive target was successfully developed. A new CdSe target with junction-type structure was employed to realize the improved characteristics as given below. The sensitivity is about 20 times higher than that of conventional vidicons, which makes it possible to operate the tube with low levels of faceplate illumination of 0.1-1 lx. A typical sensitivity is 200 nA/0.5 lx with scanning areas of 9.5 × 12.7 mm2. The gamma of the light transfer characteristic is 0.9. The tube provides a wide spectral response over the whole range of visible wavelengths. The dark current is less than 1 nA. The lag is 10 percent for a 200-nA signal current. High resolution is achieved. Afterimage and burn-in are hardly observed under normal operational conditions. The life of the tube extends to more than 1000 hours. With these characteristics, the CdSe vidicon can produce suitable pictures with good quality both for industrial use and for broadcasting use. The detailed structure of the target is also discussed."
"InAs charge-storage photodiode arrays for electron-beam vidicon applications are being developed. The InAs array diodes exhibit sufficiently low reverse leakage currents for the diode to be operated in a charge-storage mode with an electron beam scannig at the conventional TV scanning rate of 1/30 s, at a diode temperature of 77 ° K. The meaured typical reverse leakage current density near liquid-nitrogen temeperature is in the range of 5 × 10^{-10} A/cm^{2} at the reverse bias of 5.5 V with minimum background radiation on the diode. For the low-bias region, a study of the reverse current as a function of temperature indiactes that the current transport mechanism is thermal in nature, and that it is dominated by the generation current in the space-charge region of the junction, The target structure is very similar to the silicon diode array vidicon target; the n-type substrate side of the target receives the infrared image, while the array side is scanned by an electron beam. The spectral sensitivity for radiation passing through the n-type substrate of an InAs photodiode is narrow-band nature and can be greatly increased by the use of a heavily doped n^{+} -substrate, which causes the absorption edge to shift to the higher energy. Such an infrared vidicon target structure can be very effective, for it automatically eliminates large amounts of unwanted background radiation without use of a lossy filter. InAs charge-storage photodiodes are also proven to be very, sensitive high-gain infrared, detectors, because of a carrier multiplication gain which results in quantum efficiencies greater than unity. The internal carrier multiplication is an integral part of the charge-storage array diodes in vidicon operation. InAs charge-storage photodiode arrays have been measured, with a demountable electron-beam TV system and preliminary test results have been obtained. Measurement of a line array with electron beam reveal a high sensitivity at a wavelength of 3.25 µ. The results indicate that very sensitive infrared imaging systems using a beam readout technique are realizable."
"This paper proposes the use of a thin slice of a pyroelectric single crystal as the target of an electron beam scanned camera tube. This target would be sensitive to thermal images generated by black body radiation. It is shown that 104resolvable picture points per cm2of a TGS target at a frame rate not lower than 10 Hz and a thermal resolution of 1°C in the scene should be obtainable. A pyroelectric thermal imaging camera tube based on these principles has been built and its operation will be described elsewhere [1]."
"The effect of beam interception on the initial-energy distribution of the electrons contributing to the operating beam and on the imaging in camera tubes is examined. It is shown that the imaging properties of different imaging systems can be compared mutually by calculating their figure of merit, which is defined as the product of beam angle and spot diameter. The beam acceptance by the low-potential target depends on the imaging system used in the tube. This is clearly demonstrated by calculations on three different imaging systems, the imaging properties of which are compared with one another. These systems have been chosen such that: 1) the influence of the Coulomb interactions between individual electrons on the beam acceptance is of minor importance; and 2) the initial-energy distributions of the beam electrons are different particularly in the low-energy region. This gives rise to differences in the lag for peak white in the three systems which are calculated. The importance of these differences depends on operating conditions and layer capacitance. It is shown that a space-charge minimum between mesh and target, which could affect the beam acceptance, does not occur at normal values of the mesh potential and of the distance between mesh and target. The influence of increasing the beam angle on the beam acceptance is calculated and found, to give rise to a paralell shift of the acceptance curve which looks like the effect of an increasing contact potential difference."
"The design to be described is based on an electrostatically focused gun which contains an accelerating lens. The triode part, which contains a limiting aperture, can consequently be biased at a low voltage, thus leading to a reduction in beam-discharge lag. A gun of this kind can be placed in a normal straight camera tube envelope, but it can also be combined with an enlarged head carrying the target, the outer diameter of the head being equal to that of the deflection coils, In this way the useful scan diagonal of the target can be made equal to the inner diameter of the envelope of the gun. A version with an enlarged head of this type has been made in the Philips Research Laboratory, making use of the Plumbicon®tube. A description of the main parts of the tube such as the triode, the focusing lens, and the landing correction lens is given. Measurements of the beam acceptance, speed of response, and modulation depth are also presented. The Appendix gives calculations of the modulation depth, taking thermal velocities, space charge, and spherical aberration into account."
"A new vidicon with color separating stripe filter integrated faceplate was developed for frequency multiplex system using a single pickup tube color television camera. The distinctive features of the vidicon are 1) a faceplate with integrated color separating stripe filters, 2) an indium oxide transparent electrode, and 3) a set of spatial frequency limiting quartz filters which act as a limiter for spurious color signals. A color television camera using this vidicon provided satisfactory color pictures."
"A channel electron multiplier plate has been used in an X-ray image intensifier to produce a full size distortion-free viewing system with sufficient image brightness to obviate the need for dark adaption. The useful diameter of the tube is 120 mm and the thickness is only a few centimeters. The characteristics of a channel plate are discussed and related to the requirements of an X-ray intensifier. Practical considerations such as field emission and gas desorption, which affect the design and performance of the tube, are also considered. The resolution capability is comparable with other X-ray image converters as it is primarily determined by the X-ray detecting layer. It is shown that the efficiency of this layer also determines the signal-to-noise ratio of the output picture and an expression is derived to show that a photocathode of only moderate sensitivity is adequate to reduce the effect of the exponential pulse height distribution of the channel plate output to negligible proportions. In addition to quantitative details of the tube performance a subjective assessment has been made relating the minimum visually perceptible detail with contrast for various X-ray dose rates."
"Infrared image converters using nickel and gold doped germanium have been built. These devices provide image brightness up to 1 fL and resolution of 25 line pairs/cm. The devices are within a factor of 100 and 10, respectively, of \"seeing\" 2-5 µm radiation from an ambient temperature (∼ 300 ° K) scene. Copper doped germanium was also studied, but was found to have a low breakdown voltage rendering it unuasble for these devices."
"The characteristics of microchannel plate/inverter image intensifiers (MCP/III) are described. This type of image tube is shown to be well suited to some night vision applications. The 25 mm MCP/III developed by the authors has a minimum magnification of 0.96, a maximum distortion of 5 percent, and a limiting resolution of 10 cycles/mm. Its luminance gain is about 105at input levels up to 2 × 10-3fc when an S20 photocathode and a P20 phosphor screen are employed. The operational life of a MCP/III is generally a few thousand hours. Accurate life data can be determined, for a given application, after the operating input light level value, the applied MCP potential, and the duty cycle are established. The unique bulb design allows the tube high voltage power supply to be placed around the tube envelope within a 50 mm diameter and reduces the total interelectrode capacitance of the gating/focus electrode to 7 pF."

"The surface-charge transistor (SCT) is a new active semiconductor device that can be used to store, transport, and control the transport of nonequilibrium surface charge. In its simplest (discrete) form, it consists of two adjacent storage electrodes and an overlapping control electrode. All of these electrodes are separated from each other and the semiconductor surface by a thin insulating film. This structure will provide storage and controlled transport of mobile surface charge along the semiconductor surface. Data are presented for both the quasi-static characteristics of this device and its transient response. The quasi-static data are compared with an analysis based on the solution of Poisson's equation for the device, and the measured transient response is compared with a numerical solution of the equation of motion for surface-charge transport. The accuracy of these models is attested to by the agreement between theory and experiment. The fabrication of surface-charge transistor structures is also described."
"An investigation, in connection with work on a direct electron printing tube, has been made on electron beam transmission through a thin nickel target into atmosphere. Comparison with vacuum-to-vacuum transmission measurements indicates that electron multiplication occurs and that such a system can provide a tool for studying ionization processes, as well as act as an ion source."
"The thermal impedance of conventional and beam lead IC packages is evaluated from the partial differential equations, which govern the temperature and heat flow within the chip and substrate, and transmission line analogy. The mounting and the geometry dependance of the thermal impedance for various heat sink and chip sizes are presented for both beam lead and conventional IC packages. The variation of thermal impedance with the number of leads and the various Ceramic sizes is shown for the beam lead IC chip.The lumped and the distributed heat sources have been considered for the different mounting structures."
"It is shown that for shallow planar bipolar transistors, tunneling, currents through the emitter-base junction can cause pronounced hFEfalloff at low temperatures."
"Dislocations have been introduced in a well-controlled way in n-p-n bipolar transistors diffused on ∠111∠ silicon by plastic deformation. Two different geometries have been considered. While the collector current shows the well-known theoretical dependence on emitter-base voltage, the base current is significantly increased and is strongly affected by base surface potential. Low-frequency noise performances are also reported."
"Thin films of VO2have been formed at 400°C by reactive RF sputtering in an argon-oxygen atmosphere. Their resistivity changes by a factor of more than 100 at 68°C. Fabrication of coplanar devices has allowed measurements of the prebreakdown region and the breakdown parameters. When a voltage is applied between the electrodes, the internal temperature rises and the device switches to the \"on\" state. Threshold voltage and current are investigated versus ambient temperature. Below about 10°C, switching is a pure thermistor effect; above this point, application of voltage causes the device temperature to rise to the phase transition temperature, when the conductivity increases sharply. The IV characteristic in the prebreakdown region and the two different thermal breakdown phenomena are analyzed theoretically."
"An experimental procedure is described which allows the accurate determination of parameters needed to calculate the small-signal gain of traveling-wave tubes using the equivalent transmission-line model of Pierce. A movable electromagnetic probe is used to measure the gain per unit wavelength along the helix and the attenuator and also to measure the initial loss. From these data the gain parameter C' and the space-charge parameter Q'C' are determined simultaneously. The value of C' enables the growth parameter x' to be obtained from the gain per unit wavelength. Excellent agreement with theory has been obtained for the variation of C' and Q'C' with beam-to-helix radius ratio b/a and with perveance, and for the variation of the growth parameter x' with C' and Q'C'. The change of initial loss with helix voltage for various C' and Q'C' has been verified. Finally the growth parameter in the attenuator has been found to be positive, as expected from field theory as well as the equivalent transmission-line model."
"The use of the corona discharge mechanism as a means of providing an electrical load for experimental high-voltage low-current dc generators is investigated. The current-voltage characteristics of several corona discharge configurations, such as point-to-plane, coaxial cylindrical, and wire-to-plane, were experimentally obtained and compared with theoretically predicted values. Of all the configurations tested, the wire-to-plane configuration is found to be capable of dissipating the maximum electrical power (nearly 3 kW/m length of wire) and exhibits a wide range of current-voltage characteristics at various pressures, depending largely upon the wire-to-plane spacing."
"The charge-control capacitance ∂Q/∂V looking into a device port is not in general equal to the intrinsic small-signal capacitance found from the low-frequency admittance ratios up to 7:1 occur in practice. This paper explains why the discrepancy occurs, and derives the condition for the discrepancy to be zero. Finally, it is shown that charge-control theory does correctly predict the gain-bandwidth product of an active device."
"A comprehensive overview of recent approaches to microwave transistor modeling and simulation is presented. Three basic approaches to semiconductor device modeling are compared: the linear two-port model, the device-physics model, and the equivalent circuit model. Equivalent circuit models are discussed in detail with examples. Good solutions to the problem of linear modeling have been found and several authors have been able to predict the noise and gain of microwave transistors in the linear operating regions. However solutions for nonlinear operation of transistors at microwave frequencies have only recently been implemented and much room for improvement remains."
"In this paper it is shown that a GaAs transferred electron device is adequately described by a simple, static IV characteristic. This characteristic is used in a time domain computer simulation with the microwave circuit represented by transmission line equivalent circuit from which the voltage and current waveforms associated with the device are derived for a particular device IV characteristic and circuit. These data are analyzed for efficiency, frequency of oscillation, and starting transient and then are observed as various device and circuit parameters are changed in the simulation. From this study and parameter scan, the criterion for an efficient GaAs oscillator circuit and the maximum dc to RF conversion efficiency for device of a given quality, as specified by its current peak to valley ratio are found. Experimental observation of waveforms and efficiency and their dependence on the circuit and device parameters were then seen to be in good agreement, thus justifying the use of the phenomenological I-V characteristic. For a device with a current peak to valley ratio of 2, the theoretical and experimentally observed conversion efficiency limit appears to be slightly less than 20 percent. The use of the simple I- V characteristic is appropriate down to frequencies less than the \"transit\" frequency."
"A composite model, which includes both electrostatic screening and an interfacial region, is developed for Schottky diode barrier height. The model is used to calculate barrier height as a function of donor concentration for a gold-on-silicon diode structure. The results show that the influence of electrostatic screening on the barrier height is small and that the barrier height decreases rapidly for donor concentrations greater than 1017cm-3."
"The noise temperature as a function of the applied field has been measured on an epitaxial silicon layer at the frequencies 2 GHz and 4 GHz. It has been found that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theory given by Moll. It is shown that for noise calculations in silicon field-effect transistors with pronounced carrier velocity saturation the noise temperature Tnversus field E may be approximated byT_{n}/T_{0}= 1 + γ(E/E_{c})^{2}with T0= lattice temperature, Ec= saturation field, γ = const."
"The resolution of \"magnetically focused\" image tubes is shown to be relatively constant with increasing magnetic flux density (B) until B exceeds (2/ηΔt), where η is the Electron charge-to-mass ratio and Δt is the transit-time, difference between focused and unfocused electrons. Magnetic flux densities higher than this value give rise to increased electron-optic resolutions, in proportion to B."
"It is shown that the maximum responsivity-bandwidth product of MIM detectors is obtained when they are biased at a voltage equal to the anode work function (in volts). The presence of invariant positive space charge increases the magnitude of this maximum."
"With the field of directions governing the field distribution in Gunn effect materials, it is shown that Shockley's positive conductance theorem is not in contradiction with the static negative resistance (SNR) observed recently when the diffusion coefficient increases with electric field. Although an SNR can be observed under certain boundary conditions, it can only occur if a time-dependent transition from one type of stationary solution to another is allowed (necessity of an instability)."

"Recently, various technologies have been developed to attain a high reliability, large scale integration and improvements of characteristics in the field of MOS devices. This paper describes a new technique for fabricating a self-aligned, area-reduced and stable MOS structure which has not been obtained under conventional method."
"Silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) technology allows the fabrication of complex MOS integrated circuits with high speed performance comparable to that of bipolar circuits but at the expense of only microwatts of quiescent power dissipation. The use of a 1 µm thick single crystal silicon films allows virtual elimination of the parasitic capacitance which seriously degrades the performance of bulk silicon MOS circuits. Complementary MOS/SOS integrated circuits fabricated with self-aligned silicon gate technology and 5 µm channel spacings make 2 nanosecond gate delays and 1 picojoule gate power x delay products possible at 5V operation. In addition to high switching speed and low dynamic power, CMOS/SOS circuits with low leakage currents and therefore low quiescent power can be fabricated. The reverse currents of vertical junction SOS diodes are due to electron-hole generation in the depletion layer and have the voltage dependence predicted by the Sah-Noyce-Shockley theory. Lifetimes on the order of 1 ns have been measured; however, the total junction leakage currents are small (50 pa/mil width at 5 V) due to the extremely small junction areas involved."
"Charging effects observed in a variety of MOS structures which have been exposed to ionizing radiation, such as that from sputtering plasmas or e-gun deposition, suggest that Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) or soft X-radiation is important in produciag these effects. Our experiments show that VUV irradiation of metal-SiO2-Si structures under positive gate bias produces large positive charging effects for hω ≳ 9 eV, the threshold for electron-hole pair creation in the SiO2. This charging seems to be accompanied by changes in interface state density. Etch-off experiments indicate that most of the positive charge resides near the two interfaces. Under negative gate bias, much smaller positive charging effects are observed for photon energies only near the SiO2absorption edge. The ability to control the absorption depth using VUV irradiation has enabled us to show that a model involving hole transport and trapping is consistent with the experimental observation. Therefore, while the hole mobility in SiO2may be quite small, it is nevertheless nonzero. Experimental results and interpretations including gate voltage, photon energy, and dose dependences will be presented."
"This paper describes the development of phospho-silicate glass (PSG) films as an effective mask against Zinc and Tin diffusions in Gallium Arsenide. Films with a high P2O5content (as much as 30% by weight) were formed by the oxidation of Silane-Phosphine gas mixtures in an inert carrier gas, and used to obtain adequate masks against these dopants. Mask thicknesses of up to 10,000 Å were shown to exhibit no tendency towards cracking during the diffusion cycle, unlike pure silicon dioxide at these thicknesses. Effective masking was obtained for diffusion depths (unmasked regions) up to 10 microns. Information on the kinetics of growth of doped oxide films is also presented."
"The most severe limitations to obtaining high power with the conventional helix-type TWT's are the conflicting demands placed on the dielectric support. These support rods must provide an adequate conduction path for the heat produced by r.f. losses and beam interception, while at the same time providing a minimum of dielectric material near the helix."
"The design and performance characteristics of a prototype high power, coupled-cavity traveling-wave tube are described. The tube incorporates periodic permanent magnet focusing and a \"shadow-grid\" electron gun. It provides greater than 125 kW of peak output power at six percent duty cycle over the frequency range 3.1 to 3.5 GHz with 50 dB of gain. Up to 10.5 kW of average output power has been demonstrated. This represents the highest average power that has been obtained from a PPM focused tube of this type. This outstanding performance is a result of excellent electron gun and magnetic focusing structure design in conjunction with a novel liquid cooling technique that passes the coolant close to the circuit drift tubes. Mechanical features, electrical design parameters and detailed operating data will be presented."
"Prior to the development of the Sperry STX-54400, the state-of-the-art for PPM focused, conduction cooled, airborne X-band helix TWT's was approximately 200 watts. Through the use of improved heat transfer techniques including improved depressed collector and output window designs, the state-of-the-art was advanced to the 400 watt level. This paper discusses the novel design features, solution of some of the problems encountered, construction details, and performance."
"Electron tubes operating in the millimeter wave regime are characterized by their small, fragile r.f. circuits which are usually machined into relatively massive supporting structures. This imposes two restrictions on the beam focusing problem, 1) the electron beam needs to be focused through such structures with minimal interception, and 2) the magnetic focusing scheme must provide enough room to accommodate the r.f. circuit and its supporting structure. Because of these restrictions, only uniform magnetic fields produced by either solenoids or large permanent magnets have hitherto been used to focus the electron beams. The recently developed magnet material Samarium-Cobalt now provides other means of meeting both the focusing field and mechanical requirements needed for milimeter wave tubes."
"This paper describes a traveling wave tube designed to give 1 MW of output power over 20% bandwidth in S-band. The slow wave structure used was the \"Long Slot\" invented at Stanford University. Methods of preventing the structure from oscillating in unwanted modes were devised and measurements of gain and efficiency bandwidths were made on a stable severed tube. A tube having a maximum gain of 40 dB had a 3 dB saturated efficiency bandwidth of 19%. The maximum efficiency obtained was 30% at a beam voltage of 120 kV (microperveance of 1.6). Good agreement was found between the theoretical small signal gain calculated using a computer program combining R. L. Pease's klystron type theory with Curnow's equivalent circuit theory, and the gain actually obtained."
"Two high power coupled-cavity traveling-wave tubes, developed for communications systems are described. These tubes produce 3 kW to 6 kW of saturated output power and 45 dB of gain with very low signal distortion required for multicarrier operation. Small signal gain variations of less than 0.35 dB over a 40 MHz bandwidth and less than 0.8 dB over the entire 7.9 to 8.4 GHz military communications band have been demonstrated. Phase linearity is within\\pm 3\\degdeviation over a 40 MHz band."
"A 3 kW CW TWT has been developed for the 7.9-8.4 GHz frequency band. For this application, a prime requirement was that gain and phase ripple be held to an exceptionally low value. Specified gain was ± 0.25 dB/40 MHz and ± 0.5 dB/125 MHz in the linear region and ± 0.1 dB/40 MHz and ± 0.25 dB/125 MHz near saturation."
"A new approach has been used to calculate the maximum input power, based on thermal limitations, for pulsed GaAs transferred electron oscillators operating in the low boundary field (LBF), circuit-controlled modes, a regime including LSA and quenched multiple dipole modes. In contrast to the inverse device length dependence of the frequency of avalanche and transit-time oscillators, it has been established that the frequencies of LBF modes do not depend on the device length L. Thus L can be viewed as an independent parameter for optimizing device performance. Analyses of time dependent thermal response of various models of the device predict a thermal decay constant τ which is proportional to L squared. The expression for τ predicts values in agreement with our experimental results. To avoid excessive cumulative heating the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is set equal to τ-1; hence, L is determined for a given PRF."
"Gallium Arsenide LSA devices will be useful in phased arrays only after precise and reliable control can be obtained on both the output frequency and phase of the device. In this work, detailed measurements have been made of the frequency and phase locking properties of pulsed LSA S-band oscillators in a variety of circuit configurations. LSA diode parameters, along with circuit and bias pulse considerations are presented for optimum locking performance. Data on best locking gain, electronic phase control, and optimum spectral output are given. Previous LSA spectra have shown large amounts of both AM and FM variations. This is due mainly to the significant electronic tuning of these devices with bias voltage. Typical side lobe reduction is often only three to six DB below the main lobe, with noticeable asymmetry. The main lobe spectral width of a 400 nanosecond pulse was sometimes as much as 30 megahertz. With proper circuit and pulse design, symmetrical, 5 megahertz wide spectra were possible, with the side lobe reduction down to -13 DB of the main lobe, the theoretical limit. Well-behaved locking gains of over 20 DB have been observed, and the effects of circuit Q and pulse impedance on the gain have been measured. A cascaded locking experiment was performed, whereby a small amplitude CW signal was used to frequency lock a medium power LSA device, which was then used to lock a high power (100-200 watt) pulsed LSA oscillator. A novel multi-axis radial circuit, with control of the load on the device at both the fundamental and second harmonic, was used in these experiments to optimize power and efficiency to values up to 0.9 of that predicted by theory. This for the first time demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing LSA devices in a phased-array scheme."
"To a first approximation the noise factor of small-signal negative-resistance transferred-electron amplifiers is evaluated using the impedance-field method of noise calculation. The noise is considered to arise solely from thermal sources and the d.c. carrier velocity (or d.c. electric field intensity) is considered uniform throughout the diode. To these approximations a general expression can be written for the amplifier noise factor. The effects of different a.c. cathode boundary conditions can then be demonstrated."
"A three terminal Gunn effect oscillator which allows the frequency of the oscillations to be controlled by a voltage applied to a control gate has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The control gate is a reversed biased gold on gallium arsenide Schottky barrier which overlays the region through which the domain passes."
"A high-speed three-terminal pulse regenerator that is operable under dc-biased conditions and having the trigger sensitivity of as small as 0.1 volt has been developed to a practical level for the first time. The device can generate pulses of 0.3 - 1 ns width with output power levels in excess of 0.5 volt into a 50 Ω line."
"The n-GaAs planar Gunn device with a Schottky-barrier gate near the cathode has been operated by controlling a domain nucleation-notch by means of the increase in the field due to the extension of the depletion layer under the gate. This three-terminal Gunn-effect digital device has several primary advantages such as excellent uni-directivity (more than 30 dB), simplicity in construction and circuit use, and a large trigger capability (more than 100 mA/V)."
"One of the constraints in the application of Schottky barrier diodes for power, logic, microwave or photodetection has been low reverse breakdown voltage. The breakdown voltage for these diodes is primarily governed by a semicircular shaped electrical fringing field. Guard ring diffusions and/or field plates have been used to increase this voltage. However, both these methods suffer from increased capacitance and increased area requirements. A new fabrication method, the mesa planar structure, has been devised to increase breakdown voltage without an increase in capacitance or area requirements. The process, results and comparison with alternative methods will be described in this presentation."
"The application of Schottky diodes in high speed switching circuits has often been limited because of conventional devices inherently low reverse breakdown voltages and large leakage currents. Guard-ring Schottky diodes exhibit low leakage current and high reverse breakdown voltage, but their application has been confined to low currents because of minority carrier injection from the guard-ring at high forward bias level."
"While experimenting with Schottky-barrier diodes in this laboratory, an unusual I-V characteristic of a GaAs nn+epitaxial diode with Ni-Au contact was observed. The reverse characteristic is normal with a sharp breakdown voltage around 50 V. The forward clark characteristic shows no current until it breaks down at about 60 V. Under illumination, a large current flows at a forward voltage less than 1 V. The forward characteristic looks like that of an emission-saturated thermionic diode except that the saturation current increases drastically with illumination. This phenomenon is reproducible on all diodes fabricated on a certain wafer."
"The properties of a bulk-effect millimeter-wave detector made from high-purity epitaxial GaAs are discussed. The devices are operated at 4.2°K in an unusual mode with DC bias above avalanche breakdown. When operated in this mode as a direct video detector, circuit-limited response time (10%-90% pulse) less than 20 nsec is observed, which is an order of magnitude faster than the response of bulk GaAs and InSb mixers. NEP values of less than 10-10watts (D* on the order of 1010) in the video detector mode have been measured over the frequency range 10-70 GHz. The dependence of detector performance on operating parameters and frequency is given and compared with the predictions of hot-election theory developed for InSb detectors. Its performance is also compared with that of microwave-biased InSb, thermal, pyroelectric, and photoionized-impurity GaAs detectors and with point contact, Schottky barrier and MOM (tunneling) diodes, and is shown to provide significant advantages of either burnout resistance, risetime, or noise over all competitors in the millimeter spectral region."
"InAs p-n junction photodiodes with high breakdown voltages and extremely low reverse-leakage currents up to the breakdown voltage have been developed. Because of the low current and high breakdown voltage, we have observed quantum efficiencies greater than unity in reverse-biased InAs photodiodes. These gains are attributable to the avalanche carrier multiplication in the reverse-biased p-n junction. Carrier multiplication gains of greater than 100 have been measured in these devices. Relative values of the ionization coefficients for both electrons and holes can be determined by measuring the photoresponse as a function of reverse bias. The photoresponse obtained with penetrating radiations varies greatly with the bias, and the increase in the response in the high bias region appears to be caused by the Franz-Keldysh effect; i.e., the optical absorption coefficient changes with the electric field in the reverse-biased p-n junction. Detailed measurements of these studies will be discussed."
"The use of gallium arsenide phosphide for light-emitting diodes and other semiconductor devices has generated a need for a good dielectric passivation technique for this III-V compound. Our development of GaAs1/2P1/2surface passivation processes has led us to study the thermal growth of films on this ternary III-V compound in oxygen, argon, and nitrogen, as well as the RF sputtering of Al2O3, SiO2, and Si3N4onto the surface. The thermal growth studies were complicated by the fact that films were grown on the surface even in the inert N2or argon atmospheres. This paper describes these processes and characterizes the passivating film quality with respect to physical quality (adherence and uniformity) and electrical quality (dielectric properties and pinhole defects) and its etching properties."
"A convenient layout can be achieved by arranging the shift register in rows which propagate the signal charge alternately left and right and which have refresh-turnaround circuits at their ends. The surface charge transistor (SCT) previously described is a suitable charge-transfer element for this configuration, since the bi-directional clocking system required can be achieved with no dig-downs either between metal layers or to the substrate."
"Quantitative calculations have shown that the performance of charge-coupled devices (CCD's) is not limited by the motion of the mobile carriers. The limit on transfer efficiency is given by the effects of interface states. The major detrimental effects may be minimized by keeping a background charge in the device at all times. However, analysis shows that even in the presence of this background charge the limiting performance of CCD's will still be determined by th interface state density. The analysis indicates certain features in the design and operation of CCD's that are required to obtain maximum transfer efficiency for a given interface state density and bit size."
"Any charge coupled device must have a surface potential pattern in each bit such that charge always transfers in the same direction. In the two phase device to be described, the mobile charge is forced forward by a strip of repulsive fixed charge at the input end of each electrode. This strip of charge can be obtained quite conveniently and reproducibly by means of ion implantation. It will be shown that the implant permits substantial simplification of the metallization pattern compared with other CCD's and as a result, the device is easier to fabricate and high yields are easy to obtain."
"The work on charge-coupled devices has demonstrated the advantages of using MIS capacitor arrays as shift registers and vidicons. In this paper other ways of using MIS capacitor arrays are described with particular emphasis on storage arrays based on the MNOS capacitor element. By using the MNOS capacitor rather than the transistor as the storage device it is possible to construct read-mainly programmable memories of much simpler design."
"Surface-charge transport offers the possibility of achieving both high sensitivity and high image cell density while requiring only a small number of connections to the imaging array itself. The high sensitivity is achieved by allowing the charge-storage reservoirs to integrate the image for an appropriate time which is long compared to the time required for read out. High sensitivity is maintained if part of the array can be read out at the same time that the remainder of the array is integrating the optical image."
"Image sensors which are internally scanned by bucket-brigade or charge-coupling offer the opportunity fcr improved signal-to-noise ratio and ease of fabrication over conventional x-y addressed sensors. A completely-integrated self-scanned bucket-brigade sensor having 32 × 44 elements spaced on 3 mil centers has been built. As few as nine leads are required for scanning and signal output, High signal-to-noise ratio and reduction of spurious switching transients are possible by the transfer of all elemental charges to a single output terminal whose capacitance is no more than that of each elemental capacitor. A 32-stage bucket-brigade shift register is used as a vertical scanner for gating the horizontal clock drives to successive lines. Operating characteristics will be described and compared with published data on x-y addressed and charge-coupled sensors."
"Electronically-controlled delay lines based on the bucket-brigade concept have been made in the past by using MOSFET and bipolar structures. To the present time, depletion mode JFET or MESFET structures have not been used for such circuits. In this paper, the operating characteristics of JFET devices are discussed with reference to their use in a bucket brigade delay line, and it is shown that by using JFET or MESFET switches a significant improvement in performance can be expected from such circuits. The high frequency performance of a bucket brigade circuit is to a large extent governed by the current flow capability of the switching devices. For a MOSFET this is given by:I_{DS} \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{g_{m}}{2} (V_{gs} = Vth)for a JFET we have:I_{DSS} = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{g_{m}}{2} V_{p} (1- \\frac{V_{gs}}{V_{p}})^{2}The bandwidth of these devices is therefore directly related to the value of gm, which in a p-channel MOSFET device is of the order of 24 µmhos/ square and for a JFET structure of the order of 150 µmhos/square. It follows, therefore, that data rates far in excess of those already reported for MOSFET Brigades (5 - 10 MHz) can be expected from JFET structures. For low frequency operation, the bipolar brigade is severely handicapped by relatively high leakage currents which are primarily due to the enlarged base area required for the storage capacitor. With JFET brigades (using MOS capacitors) the leakage currents are considerably reduced. A ten stage JFET brigade has been operated successfully at 100°C at a clocking frequency of 100 Hz, and at 10 MHz with a 2 volt clock."
"Typical electroluminescent diodes have rough (sawed) surfaces and optically imperfect shapes, contacts, coatings, and dopants; all of which make the optical extraction efficiency (fraction of internally generated photons which actually escape from diode) difficult to calculate by conventional ray tracing. Because of the isotropic incoherent emission and the rough surfaces, the light distribution within the diode is nearly randomized and we have therefore analyzed it as a near equilibrium photon gas. Applying thermodynamic methods to the light extraction efficiency, we obtained a number of comparatively simple analytic relations and bounding expressions which we have used to optimize the optical design of GaP electroluminescent diodes. For red GaP (ZnO) diodes, design criteria were established with respect to the size, placement, and reflectivity of the contacts, the size and shape of the diode, the bulk absorption, the diffusion length, the far-field pattern and the encapsulant. Theoretical and practical limits on optical improvements were then inferred. These results explain and correlate a number of experimental observations. Similar procedures were applied to green GaP (N) diodes, but in this case the strong photon-energy-dependent self-absorption in the nitrogen-doped layer required a ray tracing supplement to the thermodynamic model and a careful measurement of the internally generated green spectrum, i.e., the spectrum prior to self-absorption distortion."
"Luminescence in GaN has been reported thus far only when the material was excited with an electron beam or ultraviolet radiation. The present work is an extension of our recent discovery of electroluminescence under point contacts. GaN diodes of the i-n (insulating-to-n-type) variety have been made by Zn-doping. These exhibit green dc electroluminescence at room temperature. The light emitted is due to a transition to a deep level in this direct wide gap semiconductor. The radiated output is proportional to the input power; the external power efficiency is 10-4; an external quantum efficiency of one per cent has been obtained. The response time of several microseconds is limited mostly by the RC time constant of the structure. Photovoltaic measurements indicate a barrier height of about 1.6 eV at the i-n structure."
"Recently developed visible solid state light sources made by coating infrared light emitting diodes with infrared-to-visible converting phosphors appear technologically interesting. However, the maximum achievable performance of these devices has been uncertain since there was no accurate method for extrapolating the nonlinear characteristics of the phosphors. We have developed techniques for exploring the maximum possible efficiencies of these phosphors by exciting them with a tightly focused YA1G:Nd laser operating at 1.06µ. The results of a series of measurements on the brightest phosphor materials available indicate that the ultimate efficiencies are strongly dependent on the host crystal material. Of the materials we have examined, the most efficient hosts are barium yttium fluoride, BaYF5, and yttrium fluoride, YF3. The highest attainable efficiency of the latter, defined as the ratio of visible emitted power to incident infrared excitation power, is in excess of 24%. Based on these results and the known performance of GaAs infrared light emitting diodes, we conclude that the overall performance of infrared-to-visible converting phosphor-diode devices should be comparable to the direct visible emitting GaP devices."
"Several intrinsic characteristics complicate the design of nitrogen doped green-emitting electroluminescent diodes. These include an efficiency-current density characteristic which peaks at high current density (several hundred amps/cm2), and appreciable self-absorption of the emitted light by both intrinsic and nitrogen related processes. Experimental results are presented on diodes with optimized geometries chosen to provide a clear understanding of these effects. Two geometries are emphasized: (1) A slurry cut 0.4 × 0.4 mm2diode with various junction areas, and (2) A hemispherical domed antireflection coated device. It has been found possible to achieve reduced junction areas in these devices using electrochemically controlled preferential etching techniques and these will be described. Careful comparison of diode spectra with the true internal emission spectra show that the 0.4 × 0.4 mm2diodes with reduced junction areas achieve higher external quantum efficiencies both because of higher operating current densities and because of a more favorable optical coupling geometry. The experiments show that at least a factor of two is lost by self-absorption in typical devices. The hemispherically domed, reduced active area, antireflection coated diodes recover much of this loss. This structure is shown to produce optimum optical coupling at optimum current densities for green diodes within a materials technology using only GaP."
"GaP monolithic numeric readouts with a character size of 3.1 mm × 2.2 mm have been developed by mesa-etching techniques. A serious spreading of the emitted red light beyond a segment, which is expected in GaP crystal because of low internal absorption, has been overcome by sufficiently deep mesa-etching with a combination of hot aqua regia and stable SiO2films. Completed devices with seven segments are operated at only 10 mA."
"Q-switching of molecular lasers (CO2and N2O) by the use of intracavity saturable absorbers has been achieved on many different lines with a variety of molecular gases. Since this effect is essentially \"passive,\" the pulse frequency is difficult to specify and also subject to the vagaries of fluctuations in cavity length and laser excitation. The application of a suitable combination of DC and time-varying electric fields to an appropriate absorbing gas has enabled us to eliminate this frequency instability and to produce high efficiency driven Q-switching in both the 9.4µ and 10.4µ bands of the CO2laser. By this technique, the absorption cross section is rendered a function of the applied Stark field in addition to its dependence on the incident light intensity. Both pulsed and sinusoidal electric fields have been used to induce Q-switching, with 200 volts being a typical driving voltage. The average power in the Q-switched mode, using this control technique, is as high as 95% of the unmodulated laser output power, and pulse repetitive rates up to 135 KHz have been achieved."
"A novel method of simultaneously stabilizing the oscillating frequency and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a passively Q-switched CO2laser is presented. The method is based upon the direct sensing of the PRF which is a function of the laser's operating point on the frequency dependent CO2gain and SF6absorption profiles. The tunable, passively stable laser uses tandem sealed-off CO2gain and SF6absorption cells inside of a dispersive cavity. An error signal derived from the direct measurement of the PRF was used to actively stabilize the laser and maintain long-term operation for pre-selected conditions. Typically, frequency stable operation is obtained at stabilized PRF's from 20KHz to 80 KHz with varying duty factors."
"A new injection-locking technique for frequency stabilizing CO2laser oscillators is discussed. In contrast to more conventional injection locking, in which the injected signal pulls the laser oscillation into phase, in hybrid operation the drive signal is applied to a wavelength which does not oscillate because of competition with higher gain transitions. With the aid of the injected signal, oscillation switches to the frequency of the injected signal and its normal oscillation is completely quenched. This hybrid stabilization is inherently flexible and allows frequency stabilized operation on a large number of lines. Furthermore, the difficult to implement optical phase comparison technique required by ordinary injection-locking approaches is replaced by a simple amplitude discriminant. To demonstrate the potential of this technique, a 60 W sealed-off CO2laser was locked in frequency by the injection of a 0.5 W signal. Expressions for the frequency locking range, the extracted power and the gain-bandwidth product are derived as a function of injected power, the undriven laser power, and the resonator coupling. Experimental data in agreement with theoretical analysis are presented."
"The performance of a high power, diffraction grating coupled ring resonator laser is described. A cw output power of four kilowatts at 10.6 microns in a near diffraction limited beam was obtained. The active medium was generated by a gas dynamic laser. Axial mode selection in resonator was used in conjunction with the Doppler shifted gain of the flowing medium to control the direction of oscillation. It is deduced from the directional behavior of the laser and the mode selective properties of the resonator that single frequency operation was obtained."
"Experimental measurements of laser power output and chemical efficiency are reported for a continuous HF chemical laser. In this device, arc-heated N2is mixed in a plenum with SF6to provide F atoms. The mixture is expanded to form a supersonic jet into which H2is diffused. Population inversion and lasing are due to H2+ F → HF (v) + H. Power levels of 1 kw have been obtained The efficiency of conversion of chemical energy to laser power is 16% at lcw SF6flow rates and approximately 10% at maximum power. For a fixed arc power, addition of O2into the plenum raises peak power by about 25% under present operating conditions and reduces sulphur deposition on mirror surfaces. The presence of HF and DF in the plenums of DF and HF lasers, respectively, did not appear to degrade laser performance. However, the presence of HF and DF in the plenums of HF and DF lasers, respectively, did degrade laser output. For given flow conditions, peak net laser power was obtained when the optical cavity axis was about 2 cm downstream of the H2injection station. Laser output was quenched when the cavity axis location was greater than 5 cm downstream."
"Performance studies of He-Ne, He-Cd, He-Zn, and He-Se lasers of same length and bore diameter will be described. They show that the He-Cd laser is most efficient of the metal vapor lasers and compares well with the He-Ne laser. Conventional He-Cd lasers suffer from problems with metal vapor confinement and high radiation noise. Both of these problems can be overcome by using the re-circulation geometry described in this paper. The most convenient re-circulation laser geometry uses a diffusion return path which coaxially surrounds the main laser bore and allows metal vapor transport in a direction opposite to the cataphoretic transport through the main discharge bore. Cataphoretic confinement sections are provided at each end making the coaxial vessel a \"cataphoretic bottle\" from which no metal vapor can escape. Continuous long-time operation has been demonstrated for such lasers having power outputs of 5, 10, 25, and 160 milliwatts."
"In the design of microwave bipolar transistors, there has been extensive utilization of three basic geometries: interdigitated, overlay and mesh emitter. In view of the obvious cost-performance-reliability trade-offs of the geometrical designs, an understanding of attenuation along un-metallized stripes is imperative. This paper summarizes an experimental and theoretical investigation of the variation of output power by the r.f. attenuation along a diffused stripe where current was fed from one end only. The experiments have employed the overlay geometry with 2.5 µm linewidths and 4 µm spaces. Diffused stripe length, Le, was varied while the emitter periphery, Pe, the base area, Ab, and the emitter area, Aewere kept constant. At a frequency of 1 GHz, it was observed that for the same input power, the output power decreased by\\sim 25%in Class C operation and\\sim44%in Class A as Lewas increased from 19 µm to 36 µm. Interestingly, in both modes of operation, no change in output power was noted for Le's between 12 µm and 19 µm. The obvious implication is that in these structures r.f. attenuation does not play a dominant role until the stripes reach a length of ∼ 20 µm, allowing the use of quite wide emitter metallization. A simple analysis has been carried out to better understand the r.f. attenuation mechanism and relate it to experimental data. The attenuation constant,a, was calculated using ordinary transmission line theory. Then, the collector current, Ie, was found employing this value ofa. Variation of the output power was, then, inferred from the variation of Ie2. Correlation between theory and experiment is satisfactory considering the simplifications introduced into the analysis."
"This paper describes the effect of emitter surface concentration and emitter depth on the temperature coefficient of collector current, band gap narrowing in the emitter region, and burst noise characteristics of NPN transistors. A group of transistors were fabricated with three different surface concentrationsC_{0} (5 \\times 10^{21}/cm32 \\times 10^{20}/cm3and6 \\times 10^{19}/cm3) with a fixed emitter depth of XJE= 1.5 µm. A second group of transistors were fabricated with three different emitter depths (XJE= .8µm, 1.5µm and 2.2µm) and fixed surface concentration (C_{0} = 2 \\times 10^{20}/cm3). Few units from each group were subjected to an annealing experiment where the devices were heated to 800°C for 16 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere."
"In this paper we unify the treatment of high current in the collector region of epitaxial transistors. New results yielded by this unification include: a) specification of the conditions that determine the predominant mechanism controlling the degradation of β and fT."
"A one dimensional approximation of the TRIM transistor consists of an electron-hole plasma in series with a high field near the intrinsic region. Our analysis of this type of structure differs from a previous one in that it allows a variable plasma width,W_{b}^{2} \\propto {\\frac{J_{b}}{V_{T}^{2}}, \\epsilon \\ll 10^{4}V/cm\\frac{J_{b}}{V_{T}}, \\epsilon > 10^{4}V/cm where Wbis plasma width, Jbis base current density, VTis collector voltage and ε is electric field in the high field region. This expression is valid whenW_{b} \\ll W_{T}where WTis the width of the near intrinsic region. Given a plasma density greater than the background doping density, the current gain ratio for pnp-type structures is identical in form to that of npn-type structures, i.e.,\\beta DC \\approx \\frac{4L^{2}}{W_{b}^{2}}, whereLis a carrier diffusion length for emitter injected carriers. The analytical closed form solution gives physical insight into TRIM design and compares favorably to the more accurate computer analysis."
"Analytical solutions for the forward characteristic of thyristors have been presented in the literature. All of them are limited to abrupt and constant doping profiles. Average values for the mobilities and the carrier lifetime have to be assumed for each region of the device. Results will be presented here which are based on an exact numerical solution of the transport, continuity and Poisson equations for the one-dimensional thyristor. Doping, mobility and lifetime can be varied from point to point. Thyristor structures are much longer and higher doped than the devices treated numerically in the literature. The number of iterations necessary to obtain an exact solution can still be kept within reasonable limits by starting from an analytical solution. For this a new analytical approximation for the space charge layers under high injection conditions had to be developed. The dependency of the forward characteristic on various device parameters was examined, and the important results were verified experimentally."
"The effects of thermal feedback on the characteristics of multiple emitter stripe silicon power transistors are considered in detail and 1) a method is presented for correlating the isothermal characteristics with the effects of thermal feedback so that observed output characteristics may be predicted and 2) emitter stripe designs are developed to achieve uniform temperature and power distributions. A number of authors have considered the effects of nonuniform temperature distribution. This paper will present a method of isothermal characterization of collector current and base-emitter voltage as functions of power density and temperature, which when combined with two-dimensional thermal analysis for proposed designs, allows the prediction of steady-state device characteristics. The specific temperature uniformity required to alleviate thermal feedback can be predicted and achieved by optimizing the thermal coupling between emitter stripes."
"A beam-lead sealed-junction silicon air-isolated-monolithic (AIM) ECL logic gate is described which has propagation delays of as little as 250 picoseconds. The basic building block of the circuit is a 6 GHz silicon microwave transistor with an fmaxof 10 GHz. The transistors have 2.5 micron stripes and 2.5 micron spacings with a base width of 0.15 to 0.2 micron. Computer simulations of several popular isolation techniques show that the minimization of parasitics achieved with the AIM technology is necessary to achieve these speeds. The analytically predicted characteristics include a dc transfer slope of 5.1 and the following propagation delays: NOR turn-on: 300 ps, NOR turn-off: 250 ps, OR turn-on: 300ps, and OR turn-off: 410 ps. The differences in the propagation delays are caused by current-source modulation."
"A beam-lead sealed-junction silicon air-isolated-monolithic (AIM) low level amplifier has been developed with a closed loop gain of 13 dB terminated by 50 ohm input and output impedances. The low frequency and high frequency 3 dB points are below 20 KHz and above 700 MHz, respectively. The amplifier is a three-stage transistor feedback amplifier with diode bootstrapping. A common emitter stage is followed by two cascaded emitter followers with bootstrapping between the first stage collector and the second stage emitter. The transistors are 4 to 5 GHz silicon devices with an fmaxof 7 to 12 GHz. The devices have 2.5 micron stripes and spacings with a base width of about 0.20 micron. The series-connected forward biased bootstrapping diodes consist of the emitter-base junction of the transistors with the collector shorted to the base. Diffused bias resistors are included in the AIM circuit. Amplifiers have been fabricated with a 13 dB gain and 1.0 GHz bandwidth. In going from an ambient temperature of 25°C to 60°C, the gain deviation is tess than 0.1 dB and the phase deviation is less than 2° up to 300 MHz."
"This paper describes a unique self-scanned monolithic array of high voltage MOS transistors which control the piezoelectric stimulators in the Optacon tactile display developed at Stanford. This monolithic circuit performs both information processing (addressing and storage) and driving of 12 piezoelectric transducers. It contains a 12-bit dynamic shift register, a dynamic capacitor memory and 12 high voltage MOS driver transistors. The circuit has several unique requirements: 1. Low power operation (≈ 2mW). 2. Very low pn junction leakage (<10-8A/cm2). 3. Dynamic information storage using 12 large (10pF) MOS capacitors. 4. High voltage operation (up to 60V) of the transducer driver transistors. 5. Minimum parasitic lateral pnp transistor action since substantial charge is periodically injected into the substrate by the driver transistors; this charge can interfere with shift register and memory operation. 6. Process compatibility with the low threshold voltage (-2.3V) P-channel self-scanned MOS image sensor of the Optacon. A technological procedure was developed to meet these requirements. Device properties were determined and charge injection and transport were measured. The circuit was fabricated in significant quantities (∼600 units) in the Stanford Integrated Circuits Laboratory with excellent yield ( > 50%). This high voltage transducer drive circuit represents a unique example of the interaction between system requirements and monolithic device technology in achieving optimum system design."
"Digital integrated circuits have been built which exhibit sub-nanosecond signal propagation delay times at 5 mW power dissipation, thus yielding a power-delay product figure of merit which is an order of magnitude lower than existing high-speed integrated circuits. Computer-aided device and circuit analysis (both D.C. and transient) was utilized to optimize the design of the circuits. The transistor equivalent-circuit models were tailored to the operating conditions of the digital circuits; however, within that operating range, all pertinent non-linearities in model parameters such as transistor base-spreading resistance and cut-off frequency, circuit resistor vahLes and signal swing were investigated, in order to gain insight into device and circuit operation."
"The walk-out phenomena of the avalanche breakdown voltage at the drain junction of MOS transistors is caused by injection of hot carriers from the avalanche plasma into the gate oxide. This paper reports detailed data of this phenomenon observed in conventional Al or Si gate, p- and n-channel transistors of a narrow channel,L = 1.5 \\sim 2\\microm, aiming at a low-cost, electrically programmable ROM. The p-channel transistor, for example, of 5Ω-cm, n-Si, tox= 3000Å, L = 2µm, W = 50µm, Vth = -4V, can be changed to a completely normally \"on\" transistor (Vth = 6V), after applying a -96V through a 10kΩ resistor, for 1.5 sec, to the source and drain junctions, the gate electrode being connected to the substrate. The estimated electron density trapped near the Si-SiO2interface is\\sim 7 \\times 10^{11}/cm2, and the capture probability defined as the ratio of the trapped charges to the integrated avalanche current is5 \\times 10^{-11}. When the gate is biased to +50V in order to accelerate the carrier injection, the necessary pulse duration is down to 120 msec. This can be further lowered by design optimization. For the n-channel transistors the hole injection is about three orders of magnitude lower than the electron injection in the p-channel case, because of higher barrier height for holes (3.8eV) than forelectrons (3.15 eV)."
"A novel bipolar memory device for high-density, low power read/write storages has been developed, fabricated and analyzed. It has been operated at a standby power of 100 nanowatts and can be conveniently switched to currents larger by orders of magnitude to speed up the read and write operation. The cell size of 4 mil2achieved by conventional processing with a 3µ epitaxial layer thickness and a minimum metal line width of 0.25 mils (spacing 0.15 mil) allows at least 2000 bits/chip. Despite this high density an access/cycle time of about 60/150ns has been projected from array simulation measurements on single devices. In contrast to other approaches in this bit density range, this statically stable device does not require any refresh operation."
"The plasma display panel accepts digital information directly from a computer, and both stores and displays this information on a rectangular array of bistable gas-discharge cells that are separated by thin dielectric sheets from the exciting electrodes. In most applications of plasma display panels, the basic detection scheme is the visual observation of the optical output of the elements. In more complex display terminal and memory applications, however, it is desired that detection of the state of optical output of the elements also be accomplished electronically and at high speeds, and that this information be restored to an appropriate digital format. This paper describes methods of electronically extracting information from a plasma display panel by using both optical and discharge-current detection systems."
"A light-addressable gas-discharge display panel utilizing a matrix array of light-emitting gas discharges which can be selectively turned on by light has been demonstrated. This panel is similar in construction to the display panel by J. F. Nolan at the 1969 International Electron Devices Meeting except that the glass dielectric of one wall of the panel was replaced by a photoconductor-glass composite layer. The panel is operated in the dark at a sustaining voltage slightly below the voltage required for as ignition. Ignition of selected cells of the panel occurs by interaction of light with the photosensitive layer. By this means light write-in to a plasma panel is achieved. For particular conditions of operation and structures, long stay-on time and erasure by light or voltage pulsing are attained."
"The \"PLANITRON\" is a new, fiat, multi-figure, alpha-numeric gas-discharge display device of exceptionally thin structure. The device uses the cathode-sheath glow. It is rugged and thin--less than 6mm in overall thickness except for the tiny seal-off glass tip located somewhere at its back. Each figure of the display is composed of segmented multiple-electrode elements, located in the same plane as the anode and the electronic barrier or suppressor electrodes. Configurations and locations of the barrier electrodes, together with the recombination-control effect afforded by the inner surface of the glass envelope, were studied. The problems of unwanted cross-talk or \"leap-fire\" to near-by segments of figures and control of the striking voltages were solved effectively."
"Iron doped LiNbO3has been found to give very sensitive performance in holographic storage applications, permitting exposures nearly 1000 times shorter than the undoped crystals. Crystals doped during growth exhibit an interesting combination of increased sensitivity and higher optical erasure resistance, indicating that there is a marked difference between the recording and erasure efficiencies. While the increased erasure resistance is a desirable property in applications requiring repeated non-destructive readout, it is an undesirable feature in dynamic applications requiring fast read-write cycles. Efforts to develop materials that do not exhibit high erasure resistance included double-doping the samples with Fe and various possible charge-compensating centers, and iron-doping by diffusion as opposed to doping the crystals during growth."
"We describe a novel coincidence addressing plan for multiplexing multi-element liquid-crystal matrix displays which depend upon dynamic scattering (electrohydrodynamic turbulence) to achieve a light-scattering state. This plan exploits the qualitatively different responses of certain nematic liquid crystals to electrical signals of different frequencies. The approach was motivated by the absence of a sharp threshold in the scattering versus voltage characteristic, an attribute which has impeded the use of voltage half-select schemes."
"Basic improvements have been made in beam-index color TV to overcome the difficulties previously experienced in the earlier widely published index systems. These improvements warrant a fresh look at the cost and performance advantages of indexing as a means of color reproduction for the 1970's. Uniray is a single-beam index system which provides index signals which tend to be independent of picture modulation. Uniray does not require extreme sweep linearity nor critical beam tracking. Also overcome are shielding and radiation problems of earlier indexing systems. Compared to shadow-mask or aperture-grill techniques, Uniray has performance advantages including much higher efficiency, allowing greater brightness for a given cost of high-voltage supply, and sharper pictures throughout the life of the equipment. It requires properly designed electron-optics and the addition of small, relatively inexpensive low-level circuits, which can readily be in integrated form. The cost of these additions is more than paid for by savings from simplification and elimination of a number of inherently expensive and bulky parts used in shadow-mask type systems. How Uniray operates to achieve these advantages will be described, and pictures will be shown of performance achieved."
"Generation of high repetition rate optical pulses by means of mode-locking lasers for pulse communication systems is of current interest. The repetition rate of the pulses generated is usually equal to the longitudinal mode spacing of the optical cavity. For this fundamental mode operation the maximum PRF is limited by the physical dimension of laser rod, modulator crystal and ancillary optics. Another practical problem is the switching of the phase of the output pulse train relative to the modulator drive signal. In the first part of the paper, experimental results are presented on higher order mode-locking of a cw pumped Nd: YAG laser in which optical pulses are generated at multiples of the c/2L frequency of the laser cavity. Intracavity LiNbO3, orientated for use as a phase modulator, was driven at frequencies up to 1800 MHz, six times the fundamental PRF. In each case the laser mode-locked at the respective drive frequency. The effect of modulation order on pulse width is discussed."
"An internally frequency-doubled, mode-locked Nd: YAG laser has been used to produce an output pulse train of sub-nanosecond 5320Å pulses. The laser operates in the TEM00transverse mode and produces an average harmonic output of approximately one-half watt. The interaction between intra-cavity harmonic generation and mode locking affects the output pulse train in several aspects including pulse repetition frequency and pulse length. These effects and the long-term stability of the laser are discussed. This laser is particularly suitable for use as the transmitter of a pulse-code-modulation optical communication system. Although the 5320Å YAG laser has previously been considered for this application, crystal damage and output pulse stretching, have limited its usefulness. This paper describes a laser which overcomes these limitations."
"The finite lifetime of conventional pump sources and the limited power available in a spacecraft make solar pumping of a space-borne optical communication laser an attractive approach. This paper describes a Nd: YAG laser in which solar energy is used directly to produce the population inversion. Sunlight is collected by a 24-inch diameter mirror and focused into the end of the laser rod. This \"end pumping\" configuration permits \"side pumping\" by lamps or light-emitting diodes when the sun is not visible from the satellite. The laser rod is soldered to a heat sink and cooled by direct conductive cooling, a technique which is compatible with spacecraft application. A multi-nlode output of 1.5 watts has been obtained with this laser. A specially-designed, low-loss LiNbO3phase modulator is used to mode lock the laser and produce an output pulse-train which is suitable for use in a pulse-code-modulation optical communication system."
"A stable, mode-locked Nd:YAlG laser source would be useful for low-duty-cycle, pulsed optical communications and for providing a stable source at 5320 Å by means of second harmonic generation. Several problems arise in the construction of such a source. These are due to the extreme narrowness in frequency of the mode-locked region (6-7 kHz), the presence of relaxation oscillations at the edges of this region, and the instability in envelope phase of the output pulses when using a phase modulator."
"Attempts to obtain large TEM00mode powers from CW-operated Nd: YAG lasers have generally been unsuccessful due to depolarization and phasefront distortion resulting from thermally induced nonuniform optical anisotropy in the active material. Several methods have been proposed to neutralize the anistropy's detrimental effects. These techniques involve either birefringence compensation or the use of a new host material (yttrium ortho-aluminate) for the active Nd-ions. YAlO3has a strong natural uniform birefringence which is only weakly perturbed by the thermal component."
"We report a technique of Q-switching a high-gain, flash-pumped laser which is capable of extracting, within a single pumping flash, an arbitrary number of output pulses with individually predetermined energies and times of occurrence. Conventional Q-switched lasers which vary the reasonator from a high loss to a fixed low loss state cannot achieve this because the energy of a Q-switched laser pulse is a function of both the population inversion at the onset of Q-switching and the threshold inversion established by the switch. Since the former varies during the pumping flash and the latter is usually fixed by mirror transmissions, etc., it is not possible to independently predetermine the energy and time of occurrence of an output pulse. This can be accomplished, however, with an acousto-optic beam deflector placed in a resonator whose optical arrangement is such that the undeflected portion of the laser beam goes into output and the deflected portion goes into the feedback loop. Because the deflection efficiency of an acousto-optic device is proportional to the acoustic power therein, the round trip, feedback of the resonator (and correspondingly the threshold population inversion) can be electronically controlled by varying the rf power applied to the deflector. This in turn allows the extraction of a pulse of any desired energy (subject to a maximum, of course) at any arbitrary time by applying a suitable rf pulse to the A-0 deflector. Furthermore, because the low Q-state of the laser involves almost 100% round-trip loss and no power to the deflector, high standoff capability and low rf power requirements are realized."
"We report the first successful operation of a high repetition rate, repetitively Q-switched ruby laser. Repetition rates up to 4 kHz have been observed by employing an acousto-optic Q-switch. At rates up to 2 kHz, there is good amplitude stability with peak-to-peak variations of less than ± 10% easily obtained. Previously, using a rotating mirror Q-switch, the highest repetition rate attained was 400 Hz. At this repetition rate, peak powers of 25 kW were commonly obtained. Based on the lifetime of the metastable state of ruby (∼ 3 ms) and a pump level 3-4 times above threshold, it was previously expected that the highest achievable repetition would be approximately 1 kHz. The fact that good Q-switched outputs up to 2 kHz can be easily obtained and repetition rates up to 5 kHz can be observed was somewhat unexpected."
"The possibility of using a variety of transit-time delay effects in semiconductors to generate microwave power has been much discussed in the literature. A transit-time negative resistance silicon diode without avalanching has been successfully operated at Ku-band frequencies. The diode is a Pt-n-p+structure, comprising a heavily doped p+substrate with a 1 Ω-cm n-type epitaxial layer 4.5µm thick and a platinum barrier contact. When biased with the barrier junction in reverse, breakdown is observed at ∼ 30 V and when biased with the p+n junction in reverse, breakdown is ∼ 50 volts. In the 50 volt direction with a diode current of 30 mA (∼ 200 A/sq.-cm), CW powers of about 5 mW have been obtained over a frequency range of 11.5 - 14.5 GHz. The experimental units have low efficiencies but there are obvious improvements to be made in this respect. More significant is the very low AM and FM noise observed for this oscillator, being comparable or even less than that of a high quality Gunn diode."
"The harmonic contents of Gunn effect and trapatt oscillators have been experimentally investigated using a lamellar grating far-infrared interferometer and an unusual gated detection system. In order to minimize circuit effects on harmonic content a broad band nonreflecting circuit was devised. In general, only the first few harmonics of the X-band Gunn effect devices were observed and these died off rather rapidly. The experimental results were in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions and indicate that the relative harmonic content increases with n/f. No definite correlation between harmonic content and bias voltage was found. The highest frequency at which power was observed was 82 GHz, a tenth harmonic. Thus the results do not contradict the predicted upper frequency limit of operation for these devices. Components of a 1.67 GHz fundamental trapatt oscillator were observed up to 40 GHz, a, frequency corresponding to three times the normal transit-time frequency."
"Studies have been made on the current transport and microwave oscillations of reach-through p-n-p and Pt-n-p devices, and their complementary structures operated as BARITT diodes (Barrier Injection Transit Time diodes) From dc current-voltage analysis, it is established that when the applied voltage is greater than the reach-through voltage, the current increases exponentially with voltage by a thermionic injection mechanism. When the injected carrier density becomes comparable or larger than the ionized impurity density, the space-charge-limited effect causes the current to vary linearly with the applied voltage."
"Diffused silicon avalanche diodes for microwave generation and amplification reported to date mostly use a P+NN+structure. In this work we have examined the complementary type of silicon avalanche diode, namely, the N+PP+structure. We have found that these diodes have displayed greater reproducibility and freedom from microplasma effects when operated in the highpower trapped-plasma mode. Oscillation at S- and C-band of 50 W, and amplification at S-band with 40W output, 13 dB gain, and about 10% band-width has been attained from single diodes using simple microstrip circuits. Harmonic extraction from series connected diodes have produced 150 W at 3.8 GHz."
"A procedure has been developed for fabricating small avalanche diodes of either silicon or GaAs using a novel electrochemical etching technique plus electroplating of a copper heat-sinking-block. The etching technique provides improved uniformity and thickness control; 6 micron layers over 1.5 cm diameter wafers have been reproducibly fabricated with little difficulty."
"GaAs Schottky barrier Impatt diodes with nearly ideal I-V characteristics have been fabricated using nichrome as the barrier metal. The diodes were fabricated from epitaxial wafer structures grown by the vapor hydride process. The diodes were in the form of etched mesas with integral plated heat sinks or scribed mesas TC bonded to copper studs."
"The implantation of high energy ions into semiconductors results in radiation damage that must be eliminated or minimized to realize chemical doping due to the implanted ions. In the case of silicon, proper heat treatment results in electrical properties that are characteristic of the number of implanted ions. This talk will cover the electrical properties of implanted silicon, annealing procedures, advantages and limitations of the technique, and methods of use."
"Effective use of ion-implantation in device design and fabrication requires an accurate knowledge of the profiles of the species one desired to implant. In particular, a knowledge of the sensitivity of these profiles to small errors in crystal alignment or angle of beam incidence is of great importance in achieving reproducible implanted profiles over the entire surface of a wafer. This is true whether one wishes to utilize channeling or to avoid channeling in obtaining a desired doping profile."
"Meg-Ohm silicon monolithic resistors have been fabricated with sheet resistance up to 120k Ω/□ using an implanted p-layer resistor which is buried under an implanted n-guard layer. The n-guard layer protects against slice to slice variations of the fixed surface charge and was made using phosphorus doses and energy of 1.5-5 × 1012P/cm2and 30 keV. Resistors have been fabricated up to 20 MΩ(and sheet resistances in the range of 7-120k Ω) using boron doses and energies of 1-3 × 1012B/cm2and 30-300 keV. The sheet resistance, voltage dependence of resistance, temperature coefficients, junction leakage and parasitic capacitance have been measured for different cases."
"Experimental results are presented which illustrate two separate applications of ion implantation to the fabrication of silicon targets. In the first application, targets are successfully made using an implanted predeposition substituted for a standard diffused predeposition to form the diodes. The targets are characterized by dark currents <10nA at 12 volts target bias and\\sim 0-3defective diodes per target (video defects). The dose may be varied from3 \\times 10^{14}cm-2to3 \\times 10^{15}cm-2with no observed change in dark current. At 1014cm-2the dark current is increased."
"Ion implantation is presently being absorbed by the semiconductor industry as a complementry production process compatible with more established techniques. At KEV implantation has been combined with shallow diffusion and silane epitaxy techniques to develop and manufacture voltage variable capacitors for VHF, UHF and AM applications in consumer electronics, and commercial and military communications equipment. Based on the precise control and variability of the implantation process, these tuning diodes have been designed with predetermined hyperabrupt structures giving a high minimum operating voltage for minimum signal distortion, minimum tuning voltage spread, and high Qs. The reproducibility of implantation is reflected in the resulting small spread in diode characteristics and associated close tracking in large lots."
"The use of electron bombarded silicon diodes (ESB, EBIRD, GEISHA, etc.) in vacuum tubes to generate, fast, high peak power video pulses and cw r.f. power was suggested by C. B. Norris of Stanford University. In principle, the EBS tube should be capable of providing high gain-bandwidth products and compact tube geometry. To date, only a few of the promised results have been achieved and the performance limitations have generally been: (a) degradation of the semiconductor reverse bias characteristic (b) inadequate diode cooling capability (c) some degree of incompatibility between the semiconductor diode and its mounting structure and standard tube processing procedures. We have designed, fabricated and tested single diode targets that are compatible with standard tube processing procedures. The electrical test results are consistent with the semiconductor target design. We have, to date, achieved video pulse output powers in excess of 1 kw and r.f. peak power output greater than 300W at 30 MC. We will describe the diode design, fabrication and test procedures presently being employed at Raytheon."
"This paper discusses experimental results obtained with developmental electron beam semiconductor devices used as video pulse and rf pulsed amplifiers. These devices employ a grid modulated electron beam to control the current in a semiconductor target. Test results up to 860MHz with peak pulse power in the order of 30 watts are presented for rf amplifier operation. The output circuit was an untuned 50 ohm load. Also described is the performance of a video pulse amplifier with a peak power of 2 kilowatts and a risetime of 2 nanoseconds. The experimental results are compared to the theoretical predicted values."
"This talk describes research leading to the successful operation of silicon cold cathodes. This device is essentially a forward-biased silicon p-n junction whose p-surface is activated to a state of negative affinity. Electrons injected into the p-region diffuse to the surface where they are emitted into the vaucum. Contacting the p-layer without obstructing the emitted electrons can be a problem since this layer must be thin to permit efficient transport of the injected electrons to the surface, with the result that the junction may be biased only under and very near the contact. A Si:SiO2structure has been developed to overcome this problem, and, with this new structure, efficiencies (ratio of emitted current to bias current) as high as 10% have been observed with emitted current densities of over 200 A/cm2. The plate characteristics clearly indicate emission-limited and space-charge-limited regions as well as Schottky effect. Although most of the data were taken pulsed, measurements of DC emission for many hours were also made. Calculations of the current density profiles across the Si:SiO2structures indicate that practical levels of operation can be achieved with reasonably uniform emission profiles. Sealed-off tubes have also been prepared, and preliminary data indicate that the cathodes are stable."
"This paper describes the design and testing of developmental electron bombarded semiconductor devices as pulsed and CW RF bandpass amplifiers. In this configuration, the devices employ an accurately focused electron beam which is deflected in proportion to the input signal to control the current in the semiconductor target. The amplifiers operate in a Class-B RF mode. The electron beam of the desired shape and current density is achieved with a new laminar flow gun design. The beam is modulated by a traveling wave deflection structure suitable for operation over a very broad frequency range. An electron beam/deflection structure configuration suitable for operation from dc to over 4 GHz is described. Several types of traveling wave deflection structures have been evaluated and the results are briefly presented. The large-signal computer design of a semiconductor target for the bandpass amplifier is shown."
"The magnetic circuit of a typical crossed-field amplifier represents a significant portion of the structure in terms of weight and size. The development of a new magnetic material, samarium cobalt, has prompted further consideration of magnetic circuit design. This material has an energy product nearly four times as strong as most alnicos and twice as strong as platinum cobalt."
"The tube to be described is a coaxial broadband tetrode of novel design developed for use in phased-array radars at frequencies to 1500 MHz. The program objectives for the tube and amplifier were operation at 1325 MHz with 1500 watts pulsed rf output power. Pulse length and duty were to be 1200 microseconds and 0.06, respectively. The gain objective was 10 db at a bandwidth of 10 per cent."
"This paper discusses a test which measures the linearity characteristics of rf electron power tubes under conditions similar to actual operation such as data transmission. This white noise loading test for power output and signal-to-intermodulation distortion of linear amplifier tubes accomplishes the need for an improved testing technique for the more sophisticated radio communication systems and is specified by Method 2206 of MIL-STD-1311. The test method is explained and compared to the classical \"Two-Tone\" test. Result of tests performed on RCA linear amplifier power tetrodes demonstrated their inherent linearity. These test results showed similarities and differences to the \"Two-Tone\" test."
"A proton-bombardment method of preparing stripe geometry junction lasers is reported here, and the operating characteristics of these new devices are compared with the previously described oxide-insulated stripe geometry lasers. In a typical procedure, a slice containing an epitaxially grown heterostructure is bombarded with protons producing a high-resistivity layer 3 µm deep which penetrates through the active p-region of the device. The lasing region is masked from the protons by evaporated and photo-etched gold stripes 3µm thick. The device is then annealed at 450°C for 15 min. to remove the undesired bombardment-induced optical absorption while still retaining sufficiently high resistivity for current confinement. For a 12 µm wide strip, the resulting double heterostructure lasers have room temperature threshold currents which are typically a factor of two lower than the oxide-insulated lasers. Bombardment-insulated lasers have operated continuously on diamond heat sinks up to 110°C (heat sink temperature), often in the lowest order spatial mode. There appear to be no aging effects whicll can be attributed to bombardment."
"The performance characteristics of GaAlAs laser diodes which emit in the wavelength interval from 7500 Å to 8000 Å at 300°K will be discussed. Two basic devices are considered: Single-Pellet devices having emission widths ranging from 3 to 16 mils and multiple-pellet stacked arrays. The devices were fabricated from GaAlAs heterojunction epitaxial layers which were grown on GaAs single crystal substrate by multiple liquid phase epitaxy. Data is presented showing emission wavelength, wavelength half-width, quantum efficiency, peak power output, lasing threshold current density and power efficiency of these devices in the temperature range of 250°K to 400°K. The performance and reliability of the GaAlAs lasers is then compared to single heterojunction GaAs lasers of the same geometry."
"A careful study of (AlGa)As-GaAs heterojunction lasers has shown that in certain cases, the external differential quantum efficiencies are anomalously low. Evidence suggests that the decrease in external efficiency is due to the trapping of radiation in internally circulating modes. Data indicates that the excitation of the internal modes and corresponding loss of efficiency appears when the effective Fabry-Perot cavity end loss equals the internal mode losses at the sawed sides. The existence of the internal mode and its effect on the external differential quantum efficiency is demonstrated in a novel diode structure where this mode can be turned on and off at will, leading to a corresponding decrease and increase in external quantum efficiency. A model of the sawed sides based upon small diffracting facets imbedded in a high loss medium leads to simple expressions which seem to describe the onset of internal modes. Agreement has been obtained between predictions of the model and measurements on diodes. The model can be employed to design sawed-side, high peak power Fabry-Perot cavity lasers so as to avoid both catastrophic facet damage and the loss of efficiency through the excitation of internal modes."
"The Large Optical Cavity (AlGa) As-GaAs heterojunction laser diode was recently described with the unique feature that the p-type recombination region and the n-type mode guiding region were independently adjusted. A single fabrication technology can be used to prepare lasers designed for various applications ranging from CW to high peak pulsed power operation by keeping the recombination region thickness constant and simply varying the thickness of the mode guiding region. LOC lasers are capable of efficient operation to ambient temperatures in excess of 100°C. Because of their reduced susceptibility to catastrophic facet damage, suitably designed lasers and laser arrays are useful as high power sources in high temperature ambients where laser operation was previously not practical. For example, 63 W of peak pulsed power was obtained at 100°C from a small 10-element series-connected array."
"A new multi-wavelength low voltage electro-optic modulator has been constructed using the r41coefficient in a single crystal of ADP. It is intended for use in multi-color laser display and recording systems employing a single source such as a krypton-ion laser. The modulator accepts a coaxial mixed wavelength beam and separates the colors using a set of direct view spectroscopic prisms. Each color passes under separate sets of electrodes on the crystal, is individually modulated, and is recombined on axis with a second set of prisms. The design of the modulation section is based on a parallel arm interferometer arrangement with both arms passing under adjacent electrodes on the electro-optic crystal. This single crystal configuration makes the crystal simple to fabricate and adjust and results in stable operation with high optical powers and changes in ambient temperature. Typical characteristics, exemplified by the red channel, showed a 100% modulation voltage of 64 Vp-pacross 104 pF input capacitance with an extinction ratio of 50:1."
"We report a new scheme employing the acousto-optic refraction effect to control laser output. A pulsed acoustic strain produces a linear index gradient, which intersects and deflects the laser beam. The advantage of this method over Bragg diffraction is the simple electronics required to generate the power needed for high deflection efficiency. The transducer on the acousto-optic cell is initially charged to a given voltage and is then discharged suddenly with avalanche transistors. An intense pulsed strain consisting of a few cycles with a frequency equal to the resonant frequency of the transducer then propagates into the cell."
"Performance improvement in high-speed bipolar transistors has followed obvious monotonic trends, limited by the available fabrication art: narrower emitters, smaller areas, narrower bases, the heaviest possible base doping, and, more recently, the square-like arsenic emitter profile. In establishing a well-defined, heavily doped narrow base, the collector doping is increased or, more conveniently, the base diffusion is run into a shallow buried layer. In addition to defining the short base, the heavily doped collector minimizes the Kirk effect, which appears at the high current densities used. When a heavily doped base meets a heavily doped buried layer, a large junction capacitance per unit area results. The actual base diffusion area is an order of magnitude greater than the active emitter area in typical double-base stripe, single-emitter stripe designs. Hence the proposed transistor uses a structure in which a pedestal of high doping level (1017-1018cm-3) projects upward from the buried layer under the active emitter area only. The epitaxy is doped very lightly (2-5 \\times 10^{15}cm-3) so that the high capacitance per unit area contributing to CCBappears only where it is unavoidable. Such lightly doped epitaxy helps to reduce collector-to-isolation capacitance, in spite of a slightly larger collector-isolation junction area. Multicircuit chips incorporating this device have been made by using two successive epitaxial depositions. After the first deposition, diffusions are made for isolation walls and for the pedestal. Out-diffusion during subsequent processing completes the isolation and brings the pedestal to the desired distance from the surface of the second epitaxial deposition The control of epitaxy required is the same as that for a conventional device, since the critical steps are the second deposition and the succeeding processes, which are nearly the same. A comparison of transistors having identical geometries (0.1 × 0.5 mil2arsenic emitter) gave the following results: Pedestal Collector Standard Collector CCB0.13pF 0.24pF CISO0.18pF 0.27pF fT(typical peak) 5GHz 4.9GHz When pedestal devices with 0.1 mil minimum oxide holes and 0.2 mil clearances were used, loaded circuit delays of about 360 ps were found in a valid logic circuit system designed for practical application in large, fast machines. A similar model with nonpedestal transistors ran about 500 ps."
"Recent advances in microwave transistor technology have resulted in significant improvements in the high-frequency performance of small-signal npn bipolar transistors. By suitable choice of collector thickness either fTor fmaxmay be optimized: fT= 15 GHz and fmax= 26 GHz have been obtained. Typical devices exhibit a noise figure of 4 dB at 4 GHz. The improved technology comprises: one-micron anti-reflection chromium masks prepared by direct ultraviolet exposure of photoresist in the step-and-repeat camera; arsenic diffused emitters which provide a very steep impurity concentration gradient at the emitter-base junction, do not exhibit the emitter dip effect and result in improved high-frequency performance compared with phosphorus emitter devices (1, 2); and low-resistance aluminum-silicon contacts compatible with shallow emitter-base junctions."
"The use of preferential Radiation Enhanced Diffusion (RED) of impurities from an n+silicon substrate doped with antimony to an n-silicon epitaxial layer by proton irradiation followed by the phosphorus atom implantation into an n-epitaxial layer, again followed by the proton irradiation, has been successfully applied to microwave transistor fabrication. This increases the power gain by reducing collector capacitance, Cc, while maintaining high fT, which is difficult to realize by conventional means."
"In the past, avalanche breakdown has been avoided in junctions for which there are requirements for stable low reverse bias leakage and/or stable minority carrier lifetime, It is well known that breaking down the emitter-base junction of a conventional planar bipolar transistor leads to a reduction of current gain and an increase in junction leakage. Recent studies all indicate that such degradation is due to the creation of interface states at the Si-SiO2interface and that degradation can be avoided if the breakdown is forced to occur away from the interface."
"A new technology for producing P-N planar junctions which show a breakdown voltage very close to that of a plane junction has been developed and applied to the fabrication of a small signal bipolar transistor with VCEO(sus) =1200 volts and a TV horizontal deflection device for line operated TV sets. The \"corner\" breakdown of the planar junction is eliminated by using a field plate--EQR structure and the breakdown usually occurring at the edge of the field plate is eliminated by using a layer of undoped polysilicon between the two electrodes which gives a linear voltage distribution at the surface."
"The need for a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) containing pnp and npn transistors has been recognized for a long time and is becoming serious, for obtaining an unique and simple circuit. The most widely used method recently for incorporating pnp transistors into the ICs has been the employment of the well-known lateral transistor with low performance, hFEof ∼ 1 and fTof ∼ 1 MHz. Other structures have been proposed. However the improvement of one parameter has come at the expense of other parameters. Sometimes the structures are costly and complex."
"P-channel IGFET's have been ion-implanted with boron to produce a Gaussian dopant profile which is almost entirely in the silicon. These IGFET's exhibit depletion mode device behavior due to a subsurface built-in channel, and they have more reproducible conductance characteristics than those fabricated by leading edge implants for which only simple shifts of threshold voltage occur. The built-in subsurface channel structure results in a device which is characterized by both a flatband (VFB) and a drain saturation voltage (VDSAT) rather than a threshold voltage. The fabrication process users 120 keV boron ions implanted through an Al2O3(500Å)-Sio2(1000Å) gate dielectric into Si at an angle of 7° from the axis. Typical device parameters for an ion dosage of5.5 \\times 10^{11}/cm2areV_{FB} = -0.9volt,V_{DSAT} = -2.45volt atV_{GS} = 0. For W/L = 1,g_{m} = 17µmhos atV_{GS} = 0andV_{D} = -5volt."
"A MOS circuit utilizing an ion implantation technique for controlled channel doping with boron to produce n-channel enhancement transistors with controlled threshold voltages has been developed. The ion implantation permits the use of a high resistivity silicon substrate that results in reduced p-n junction capacitances and increased circuit speed with constant threshold under all substrate-to-source back bias conditions. With selective ion implantation, enhancement devices and depletion load resistors have been fabricated on the same chip without additional processing steps. Propagation delay times of the order 10 to 20 ns have been measured for one pair of cascaded inverters."
"The drain breakdown voltage of usual p-channel MOS devices is limited to about 30 to 40 V by field crowding at the drain junction. By optimizing certain design parameters like diffusion depth, substrate resistivity and gate oxide thickness, 80 V breakdowns can be achieved. To date, higher breakdowns are only possible with special device geometries (e.g. the stacked gate tetrode) which are generally not compatible with common MOS processes. By adding an ion-implantation step to the conventional aluminum-gate MOS process, it is possible to fabricate MOSSFET's with source-drain breakdown potentials of greater than 240 V on the same chip with conventional MOS circuitry. The device looks identical to the conventional MOSFET except that an unmetalized gate oxide region is left between the gate and the drain juction. During a subsequent ion-implantation this portion of the channel is lightly doped with a p-type dopant in the case of p-channel devices. Since-both the metal and the field oxide are thick enough to stop all ions, the implantation affects only the high voltage devices on the wafer. The implanted channel has the effect of reducing the field in the vicinity of the drain junction, thereby increasing the source-drain breakdown voltage. P-channel devices were made on 10 Ω-cm material using 1µm diffused junctions. The aluminum gate was 10 µm long and the implanted channel was 25µm long. Breakdowns up to 240 V were achieved after an optimum dose of2 \\times 10^{12}boron ions/cm2were implanted at 80 keV through 1300 Å of gate SiO2. The wafers were subsequently annealed for 15 minutes at 525°C in N2. Implanted resistors made at the same time had sheet resistivities of 25 kΩ/□. Of critical importance in obtaining best results are low threshold voltages and accurate implantation dose control To obtain long term reliability it is necessary to prevent charge build-up on the oxide over the implanted channel. This is accomplished by the deposition of a layer of phosphosilicate glass after ion-implantation. It is now possible to include decoding circuitry on the same chip as the high voltage drivers for display tubes."
"The main interest in C-MOS technology centers around low power applications. However, a major problem with the present C-MOS is the low packing density. We report here on a C-MOS technology which will at least triple the present packing density while increasing the speed for a given power level by reducing the stray capacitance. The performance of the new C-MOS is based on the combination of ion implantation, planox, and silicon gate technology. The new technology places each complementary transistors in a separate well or pot."
"Techniques of fabricating an N-channel silicon JFET using phosphorus ion implantation and a platinum silicide Schottky-barrier gate have been developed. The platinum silicide Schottky-barrier top gate is part of the standard contact metallization process. The phosphorus doped channel is accomplished by a 50 KeV ion implant predeposition and an 1100°C drive-in. A range of dosages and drive-in times were used to achieve various FET characteristics. A pinch-off voltage range of 0.2-7.5 volts has been obtained with typical spreads of approximately 0.1 volt across the slice. Results have been obtained for both and oriented boron doped silicon substrates. The advantages of these techniques which include fabrication simplicity, tight distributions of characteristics, and the ability to achieve various pinch-offs by implant dose adjustment will be discussed."

"Carriers moving in a semiconductor can impart gain or loss to an acoustic wave traveling through piezoelectric material. A physical picture of this familliar interaction process is given that applies to piezoelectric semiconductors as well as to layered structures in which acoustic wave and movmg earners are phystcally separated. In any of these systems, an acoustic wave is accompanied by a space charge wave, a sinusoidal pattern of electric charges. Such a charge pattern has a relaxation time that depends strongly on system geometry. It is shown that once the relaxation time is known, gain or loss as a function of frequency, carrier drift velocity, and electromechanical coupling factor can be found by a stmple method based on physical intuition."

"Two types of frequency multiplexing are theoretically analyzed for their applicability as a form of modulation in the land mobile radio service (LMRS). Both SSB/FM and FM/FM are analyzed for their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus modulation index. These results are normalized to the signal-to-noise performances of the existing 5-kHz deviation system for comparison purposes. The latter performance is developed using the actual Electronic Industries Association (EIA) response of a LMRS receiver. The spectrum of the multiplex system for the case of equal subchannel signal-to-noise is developed using a computer. The spectrum is used to determine the spectrmm occupancy of multiplex systems. Based on the tradeoffs of transmit power and spectrum occupancy, a discussion of the interference characteristics of the multiplex systems compared to the existing system is presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the spectrum efficiency of a multiplex system compared to the present system."
"The guidance cable for automatic driving vehicles can be utilized as a communication medium between the road authority of a highway and vehicles on it. This highway communication system consists of two cables laid along both shoulders of a roadway, two detecting coils attached to the front bumper of a vehicle, and a transmitting-receiving coil mounted on the top of a vehicle. This system enables voice communication between the road authority and road vehicle drivers, and enables a warning to be issued to a vehicle that my swerve from the course."

"With regret we pause to note the cessation of the IEEE STUDENT JOURNAL in November 1970. This publication had been the central feature of the Institute's student activities since the mid 1950's. At the time of its demise, coverage of the 1970 Clean Air Car Race was in preparation. Since that race is of such technical importance to the Vehicular Technology Group, we welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to the students whose race it is,a nd to the STUDENT JOURNAL. The two articles that were ready for press are published unchanged immediately following in this issue. The first article is by Charles Beardsley, Managing Editor of the STUDENT JOURNAL, and summarizes the experiences of the winning hybrid car. The second article is on an interesting subsystem designed by one team. With this article we also recognize the efforts of its author, Wally Rippel, who was instrumental in establishing the Great Electric Car Race of 1968."
"On August 24, 1970, 42 low-emission vehicles left M.I.T. on the first leg of the Clean Air Car Race. Seven days later, 35 of the cars had crossed the finish line at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. In the electric-hybrid category, two vehicles tied for first place--the University of Toronto and the Worcester Polytechnic Institute entries. The WPI car, which used an internal-combustion engine running on unleaded gas in combination with a battery-powered drive system, my have tied, but its success was in some ways a Pyrrhic victory: the solid-state controller burned out at least twice, a stepping resistor that was substituted for the controller caused a fire on the second day of the race, the heat sinks on the rectifiers overheated during the desert crossing, and the electric motor was not powerful enough to drive the car up steep grades. Nevertheless, the race proved that cleaner cars are feasible. The next step is up to government and industry. With luck, legislation now pending may curb most automotive pollutants by the mid-seventies."
"Despite recent advances in solid-state controls for electric cars, chopper-induced problems still exist: commutation and ac losses are significantly high, the chopping action induces losses within the power source, and large ripple components in the chopper output cause increased rms losses at the motor. The author's dual chopper, two conventional choppers in parallel, reduces these problems. The duty cycle generated by the firing circuit is feedback controlled so that the load current remains proportional to control output. The dual chopper operates in a three-in-one system: in the first mode, the batteries charge at high rates; the second mode controls the amount of power flowing from battery to motor; and in the third or regenerative braking mode, the chopper transfers energy from the motor to the battery."
"At the present time there is much interest in vehicle location systems [1]-[3]. For certain applications [4]-[7] precise location of the vehicle is not needed and determination that the vehicle is within a zonal area of the city is sufficient. This paper considers a vehicle location system in which an array of transmitters forms an \"electronic fence\" along the zone boundaries. As it passes throagh the electronic fence a suitably equipped vehicle receives and stores the zonal location information. This information is sent by the vehicle to a central location via a separate radio channel after receiving an interrogation message. The analysis of the communication performance of the short-range communications link between the zonal transmitters and the vehicle is the concern of this paper. Design curves and formulas are presented that allow performance calculations to be made. The implications of this predicted communication performance to a vehicle locator system are then considered. Most of the results obtained are directly applicable to a general class of vehicle location systems, which utilize the proximity of a vehicle to some coded electronic signpost to determine the vehicle's location. The electronic fence is a special case of the proximity-type system."
"A method of calculating the effect of supports on the amplitude characteristics of a Goubau line is given in this paper. The results from this method agree well with experimental data and thus predictions for a line one mile in length were made. It is shown that supports can cause limitations in the line length and in the available bandwidth."

"Descriptive and statistical analyses of radio propagation data over irregular terrain are presented with emphasis on communications between low antennas in VHF and UHF bands. Measured data are evaluated for medians and ranges of basic transmission loss and height gain, and results are compared with estimates from a propagation model developed by the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences. Effects of vegetation near the path terminals are demonstrated. Analysis results provide first estimates of propagation parameters in many terrain types and information regarding applicability of the propagation model."
"Optimum utilization of patrolling vehicles requires that the central controller be continuously informed about their location. To meet this need, a purely mechanical analog computer was designed, built, and tested. The results obtained show that systematic errors introduced by the system far outweigh random errors and that this concept is feasible as a location interpolator between fixed known reference sites. Guidelines for the next generation system design were obtained."
"Diversity is often used in radio systems to alleviate the problem of fading. It is shown here that the use of diversity in a mobile radio system also will result in better utilization of the frequency spectrum. In a system which reuses channels in physically separated areas, probability distributions of signal-to-cochannel interference ratios in 1-, 2-, and 4-branch diversity systems are developed by Monte Carlo methods. We consider two cases: first, we assume signal strength to be Rayleigh distributed, which is a valid model for reception within a small localized area; second, we take shadow losses into account by assuming a more realistic long-term fading model. The effect of using diversity in a mobile radio system is considerable with either model. Assuming a hexagonal cell pattern of frequency reuse, it is shown that frequencies may be reassigned more often in a diversity system than in a system which does not use diversity. The conclusion, therefore, is that a diversity system utilizes the frequency spectrum more efficiently than an equivalent nondiversity system."
"The concept of a small-zone system plan for mobile telephone service is reviewed, as are the advantages of spectrum economy, flexible growth, low power requirements, and wide channel spacing and the disadvantages of locating mobiles and establishing base-station sites. The functions which such a system must perform are enumerated. A call processing sequence and a mobile block diagram which perform the basic functions are outlined, followed with a proposed plan for locating mobiles with respect to the small-zone grid."

"Over the past few years a variety of space diversity system techniques have been considered for the purpose of reducing the rapid fading encountered in microwave mobile radio systems. Basic diversity methods are first reviewed in the framework of mobile propagation effects, and then specific techniques are compared from the standpoint of transmitter power required to achieve a certain performance. Criteria of comparison used included baseband SNR while moving and reliability when the vehicle stops at random. System parameters are type and order of diversity and transmission bandwidth. Tradeoffs between performance properties and system parameters are indicated. The calculations show that relatively modest use of diversity techniques can afford savings in transmitter power of 10-20 dB. For example, at a range of 2 mi, to obtain 30-dB baseband SNR while moving and 99.9-percent reliability when stopped requires a transmitted power of 8 W for a conventional FM system with no diversity. Two-branch selection diversity provides the same performance for a transmitter power of only 300 mW."
"The theoretical analysis in this paper is based on the assumption that the angles of signal arrival on the mobile receiver are uniformly distributed. From the analysis and experimental studies, we find that if the antenna spacing between two adjacent antennas in a space diversity array is greater than 0.5λ the array configuration does not affect the cumulative distribution curves nor the shapes of the level-crossing-rate (LCR) curves, and only slightly affects the signal level at which the maximum LCR occurs. Hence a three-element array with a triangular shape or a four-element array with a rectangular shape can be considered a good arrangement, provided each side (antenna spacing) is greater than 0.5λ. Two slightly better arrangements than those we just mentioned for improving the signal fading are also proposed for three-branch and four-branch diversity signals, respectively."
"The density of present and projected private vehicular traffic indicates a need for increasingly sophisticated techniques for the detection of, surveillance of, and communication with vehicles. Given these techniques, systems can be implemented to improve traffic flow and service to the motorist. All systems involve the function of data generation, processing and modulation, and transmission. Attention here is directed toward those problems occurring in the transmission aspect of the system, particularly the antenna design. Factors unique to vehicular communication for traffic control suggest, a priori, the use of antennas buried in the roadway. The basis for design criteria for buried antennas is delineated."
"It appears that both substantial improvement in high-speed high-density traffic flow and a decrease in highway accidents can be achieved by highway automation. An essential part of any approach to such automation is a method for the automatic longitudinal control of vehicles. The results of experimental tests of an automatic longitudinal control system in various lead-car overtaking, emergency braking, and car-following situations are reported. An examination of the data shows that this system can safely, efficiently, and comfortably control a vehicle during such maneuvers. The results of these tests corresponded to those predicted from previous theoretical and simulator studies."
"The baseband distortion resulting from the cochannel interference of two FM carriers nominally carrying the same modulation is considered. Such distortion was observed to plague VHF mobile telephone service in Phoenix, Ariz. This distortion arises when the landline audio delay and modulation indices of the two transmitters are not closely equalized. Both sinusoidal and Gaussian modulation age analyzed. Curves presented indicate that baseband distortion power as large as 20 percent of baseband signal power may occur for an RF carrier amplitude ratio of 0.7 and an unequalized delay of the order of 200 µs when the minimum rms transmitter phase deviation is 2 rad. Increasing the deviation to 4 rad reduces the distortion to the 5-percent range. The desirability of large index modulation in this context is thus apparent."

 "This paper discusses the analysis and design of a vehicle location, monitoring, or communications system that exploits the readily available traffic light system. Optical path transmission of digital data from the traffic-light-heads to passing vehicles permits direct, unambiguous location information to be obtained without any additional spectrum utilization. Location information is processed in the vehicle and combined with vehicle identification and status data for subsequent automatic reporting to a base station. Reporting to the base station is done through the use of the vehicle-to-base communications radios that already exist in vehicles that need such location or status information (such as police cars); or equipment can be readily added because the service and channel assignments already exist, as in the cases of school-bus and public transportation vehicles."
 "This paper concerns controlling a string of vehicles on an automated highway using a sampled-data fixed reference control system suitable for a \"moving cell\" control scheme [1]. The reference consists of equally spaced information stations (posts) along the roadside. See Figure 1. As a car reaches a post, it receives data concerning its time of arrival error (convertible into position error) plus the value of the command velocity. Each car contains a means for measuring its own velocity. Thus an on-board controller independently controls each car using position error and velocity error. The shock wave effects of moving reference (car-following) systems [1] and the inter-car communication requirements of state feedback approaches to this problem [2] are avoided. Control is simple since each car controls itself and each post simultaneously sends the same information as all other posts. No inter-vehicle communication is required. The posts can also be used to monitor system behavior and detect emergencies, although this monitoring function is not discussed here."
     "Automatic Guidance of vehicles on a lane and automatic headway control would greatly relieve the driver from his strains. The topic of this paper is the first problem only. In order to keep a vehicle on the lane there has to exist a system on the road, which is taken as a means of orientation. As a low-coast means for this purpose a row of permanent magnetic steel nails is suggested to be fixed on the centre line of the lane, the magnetic field of which is perceived by two sensors. One sensor should be positioned at the right and one at the left of the vehicle bottom, so the relation of the fields metered by both sensors is a measure of the deviation from the central line, as long as the row of nails is located between the two sensors."
 "When a conventional dc or ac motor is compared with a conventional gasoline engine, the former is a continuous machine and the latter is an impulse machine. In acutal performance for vehicle propulsion, in spite of the well known, poor efficiency of gasoline-piston engines [1], the gasoline engine outperforms generally, the electric motor, which is usually considered to be highly efficient [2] over the gasoline engine. Therefore, there is a logical possibility that if an electric motor is operated in a pulse mode with a proper dynamic energy storage and shut-off as the gasoline engines have today, the pulse mode operated electric motor may outperform present continuous dc or ac motors. The objectives of this paper are to present conditions under which the impulse motor outperforms the continuous electric motor and to point out the limitations and advantages of the impulse machines."
 "An electric vehicle propulsion system utilizing motor armature current feedback in conjunction with motor field current switching provides a precise method for the conversion of energy from electric to mechanical form and from mechanical to electric form. The mechanical energy contained in a moving vehicle is converted to electric energy which may be utilized to supplement the electric generating plant, thereby minimizing power consumption from the off vehicle electric generating system. The propulsion system also provides accurate acceleration and braking torque by utilizing closed loop techniques. Vehicle braking torque from zero to full capacity of the propulsion motors can be generated from maximum vehicle speed down to zero velocity. The system bandwidth was measured to be 10 Hertz."

"The discipline of fault-tolerant computing would be unnecessary if computer hardware and programs would always behave in perfect agreement with the designer's or programmer's intentions. However, imperfections of computer systems and program \"bugs\" have been with us since the first computer was built, and fault tolerance will remain an important objective as long as computers are in demand."
"In striving to design highly reliable, highly available computers, two basic strategies have been employed: increasing the reliability throug-h advances in component technology; and designing self-repairing computers which use functional redundancy to permit correct performance (perhaps in a degraded manner) in the presence of component failures. Time has shown a fluctuation in the popularity of each strategy, based primarily on changes in technologies, applications and costs."
"Fundamental to the usefulness of any device, instrument or system are the initial verification of its correct functioning and the maintenance of its performance during ing operation. The following discussion is concerned with such problems of initial verification and maintenance for digital systems. Systems can fail to function properly either because of incorrect specification, design, or implementation; or else because of physical deterioration or damage. Problems caused by incorrect specification are extremely difficult to deal with formally. Many cases of faulty design or implementation can be detected either by formal analysis techniques (e.g., logic circuit analysis) or by simulation methods. Of course, actual physical implentations such as integrated circuits must be subjected to measurement before final acceptance. This process of measuring the output response with specified signals applied to the inputs is called testing and is useful both for initial acceptance and also for verification of continued validity during use."
"During the last decade there have appeared in the literature many contributions on the reliability aspects of computer hardware, but relatively few on software. We see this balance changing as software is now becoming the most expensive and complex item in a computer installation. This situation is intensifying as applications become more sophisticated, as larger teams are required to produce the software, and as software mistakes that enter operational systems become more costly. We believe that this condition will be remedied when tools as powerful as those available for ensuring the reliability of hardware become available for software."
"This paper is a summary of the principal conclusions that can be made from a rather extensive survey of the open Soviet literature in the technical areas relevant to the design of reliable digital computers. Particular emphasis in the survey was on the various techniques for the constructive application of redundancy in order to achieve the reliability necessary for the successful realization of machines of high computational power and high availability. In this summary overall conclusions are presented regarding the nature and significance of Soviet activities in these fields.1"

"Random access semiconductor memory systerm components available today reflect a broad spectrum of engineering, financial and managerial judgment. Each of the products was intended to satisfy the performance and cost goals of a particular segment of the memory market. The decisions which were made regarding technology to be used, chip density, package density, package type, electrical performance and environmental performance, reflect the weighted factors of market segment need versus investment required. The resulting product is in many cases a compromise. For example, a lower chip density may result in lower cost per bit at the chip level due to higher yields. However, higher chip densities, inherent when decoding is on the chip, may be required due to the lack of a package with enough leads to accommodate a non-decoded chip. The assumption is that need to capitalize a new package production line represents higher financial risk than that which results from the lower yields at the chip level."
"The increasing use of computers and peripherals with higher speed capabilities generated a demand for a low cost, low power, high-speed memory which is directly compatible with TTL levels and drive requirements. Such a memory could be built into small local storage applications or into the main storage of a computer. The requirements of such a memory are summarized below:"

The Bibliography is given by journal in alphabetical order. The Author Index is arranged alphabetically according to each author's last name. For papers by multiple authors, each author's name appears in the index in alphabetical order; however, the fact that an author's name appears followed by the title of an article, does not mean that he is necessarily the only author of that article, he may be one of two or more authors of the paper whose title follows his name. In other words, the Author Index does not show multiple authors in any single listing."

"The author explores the possibilities of ready-made logic in developing programs and, as an illustration, proposes a standard or prototype approach to file maintenance. The approach illustrated is defined by an annotated program logic chard and a series of checklists, cross-referenced to each other."
"The development of suitable standards is a vital key to developing ing the full potential of multi-access computer networks. To date work is being done on only a few of the standards that will be required, and among these few, progress is distressingly slow. Divergent procedures are rapidly becoming entrenched in areas where there should be standards and if the current rate of standards development is extrapolated, it is doubtful that the necessary standards can be developed in time."
"Everyone agrees that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has revolutionized digital signal processing. However, no one knows with certainty the true history of the FFT.

"It is happening – the leaders in the computer industry are investing significant sums of money in planning the products which will be marketed in the early and mid-seventies. The present phase consists of market research – the evaluation of present and planned computer architectures, the competition, and the attitudes of the users. Product definition and market strategy phases then follow. Next will be the development phase which takes another; four to six months for some equipments, such as terminals, and upwards to two or more years for new computer systems. May or June should find design engineers and programmers busily occupied turning product definitions into a form which can be released to the model shop, and ultimately to the factory and sales force."

"The increasing complexity of digital systems over the past decade has been accompanied by a growing awareness of the need for efficient fault diagnosis, as proved by the ever increasing literature published on the subject. The paper is based on 86 referenced sources and its main function is to review the published methods of deriving diagnostic test sequences, indicating the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. In so doing, it traces the interaction between the diagnostic techniques that have evolved and their influence on the design philosophy of digital systems at all levels. It is apparent from the review that there exists a requirement for a unified theory of diagnosis compatible with, and complementary to current design techniques based on switching theory and ways are suggested in which this might be achieved."

"The first application of electronic computers was in the field of business accounting. The computer replaced punched card equipment and performed simple, repetitive clerical tasks. The system configurations and the application programs in this area have become quite standardized and homogeneous from system to system. The minicomputer was first applied in a far more academic atmosphere. From a curiosity in the laboratory, small computers became elements in many weird-and-wonderous systems used to monitor and control tests and experiments. Because it was there and interesting, scientists and engineers put the minicomputer to work in hundreds of different ways. Because it was sold as a basic system module, because it was easy to use and understand, and because it was inexpensive, the minicomputer became part of many different systems. The lack of standardization in input/output configurations and devices witnesses the variety of ways the minicomputer is applied."
"Industrial applications have been one of the key markets motivating the development of minicomputers. Some of the first small computers were designed specifically to perform tasks in process control, manufacturing and laboratories. Thus the history of industrial applications is as long and varied as the history of minicomputers themselves."
"The technical literature dealing with computing and data communications contains advertisements today for a tremendous variety of data communications hardware; terminals in almost every shape and size, modems, multiplexers, communications pre-processors, and so on. Applications and software packages to be used with this hardware are being described and programmers everywhere are learning how to optimize data transmission to and from their computers."
"The minicomputer's power to perform repetitive clerical tasks, monitor and control real-time processes, and perform scientific calculations has made it desirable in hospital systems. The minicomputer's inherent low cost has made it practical. Computer suppliers to the medical field are recognizing that they must collaborate with medical professionals to pinpoint well delimited problem areas."

"The digital computer control of physical processes requires parameters that can be altered digitally. A resistor design is described that provides settings in a wide range with fixed precision. For this purpose a binary floating-point format is used both for expressing the resistor values and for the digital setting. A resistor structure is given that yields values expressed by the above format. Implementation employing electromechanical and electronic components is presented. The configuration described compares favorably with a straightforward binary design. It is expected that such a resistor will be especially useful for hybrid passive-network analyzer applications and, employed as a reference device, for the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion of other kinds of quantities."
"This paper explores some new solutions to the problem of high-speed data reconstruction in real time. Two types of nonresetting data reconstructors are developed. Both types are simpler than the classical extrapolative hold circuits and when optimized give better performance. The optimization procedure is given and results of simulation studies are included."
"The research reported in this paper is concerned with the use of functional analysis and operator theory in providing insights into iterative computational methods. The computational methods are discussed in the context of obtaining the closed-loop response of a complex feedback system on a hybrid computer. The need for iterative solution arises in problems in which the feedback cannot be computed instantaneously, for instance, when there are partial differential equations, and/or where there is a large number of arithmetic and logical operations. The tools of functional analysis are used to devise computational schemes with improved convergence properties."
"This paper deals with a fault detection and diagnosis technique based on Boolean differences. A brief review of the notion of a Boolean difference is presented, and the concept of partial Boolean difference is introduced. An algorithm for obtaining minimal, complete sets of test-input sequences based on the partial Boolean differences of a switching function is formulated, and illustrations demonstrating the use of the technique are presented."
"This paper contains a description of the architecture of the fast digital processor (FDP), a general purpose digital attachment to a UNIVAC 1219 computer facility. The main purpose of the FDP is to enhance the capability of the UNIVAC facility for performance of digital signal processing operations such as digital filtering and discrete Fourier transforms. The structural design evolved during a series of discussions among the four authors. The FDP is presently being constructed under the supervision of one of the authors, P. McHugh, and should be completed in late 1970."
"In developing its chemical information system, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) has built files which require hundreds of millions of bytes of storage and in which data elements may range in length from zero in one instance to several hundred bytes in another. To cope with this size and variability, CAS has developed an internal standardized storage format and has implemented it on the IBM System/360. This format, which is called Standard File Format (SFF), accommodates a mix of fixed-and variable-length data elements and permits the addition and deletion of data elements without affecting the program code. Symbolic addressing of data elements is achieved through the use of a directory within each record in the file. Implementation of standardized files has permitted the CAS system to operate with greater generality and flexibility."
"In binary counters, the parity bit is not preserved when the data undergo the counting operation. It is necessary to predict the parity bit that should be used with the correct result. A special design has been devised to share as much hardware as possible between the counter and the parity prediction circuit. This reduces the number of logic gates and gives a more efficient design. The scheme involves the use of the first 0 detection for both the counting operation and the parity prediction."
"In this paper we develop an algorithm to design a switching network using only gates which represent negative functions. The number of gates in the network is minimized under the conditions that 1) the network consists of two levels, and 2) no fan-in restriction on each gate is imposed."
"A method is described for determining an optimal straight-line segment approximation to specified functions for constrained and unconstrained endpoints."
"A family of graph-theoretical algorithms based on the minimal spanning tree are capable of detecting several kinds of cluster structure in arbitrary point sets; description of the detected clusters is possible in some cases by extensions of the method. Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional space, have been analyzed by these methods also. PL/1 programs to implement the minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged."
"In this paper there are developed simple processes for deriving, for finite synchronous sequential machines, polylinear sequential circuit realizations using trigger, set–reset, or J–K flip-flops as the memory elements. It is shown that each such realization is directly obtainable from a graph analogous to the reverse state diagram of the given machine; the latter graph was shown in a former paper by this author to correspond to a polylinear sequential circuit realization using delays for memory. The processes consist of the straightforward steps in the construction of the reverse state diagram analogs. Almost polylinear sequential circuits are defined, and it is shown how certain proper subgraphs of the aforementioned graphs can be used to derive these circuits."
"T. A. J. Nicholson has introduced a restricted class of drawn graphs (N-graphs) into the problem of drawing a graph with a minimum number of crosspoints. This short note shows some defects in representing the capability of N-graphs by presenting a planar graph which cannot be represented by any N-graphs."
"A design technique using complementary gating and simulated data was developed to permit a straight binary counter to be used as a variable-mode counter. Any family of binary logic modules can be used."
"A computer control system simulation method utilizing two computers is presented. One is a control computer operating under almost actual conditions. The other is a multiprogrammed computer that simulates the plant. The time taken by the control computer to compute the control variables can be a function of the plant state. An optimum control example illustrating the application of the method is given."
"This note considers the operation of systems composed of interconnected asynchronously operating modules and shows that some such systems may enter \"blocking conditions\" in which no module can change state. The model considered applies specifically to asynchronous systems in which each module is controlled only by its neighbors, but may also be relevant to other systems such as parallel computational schemes. We also demonstrate a procedure that may speed up computation and we show that the function computed by a given network may depend upon the initial state."
"In this note we establish a new upper bound on the time to compute classes of switching functions. As did Shannon and Lupanov in their study of the number of elements necessary to compute switching functions, we base our method on a Shannon expansion about a certain number of variables of the function being computed."
"A TANT network is a three-level network composed solely of AND-NOT gates having only uncomplemented inputs. A method of minimal gate TANT realization of a Boolean function is presented. The procedure permits hand solution of four-and five-variable problems. A computer program will be required to handle more complex cases."
"A method, called conditional interpretation, is proposed which will allow small computers to have as large a set of instructions as may be desired without using a large number of bits to hold the operation code. The method is based on the redundancy of machine language instruction sequences. Most machine language instructions have a limited number of \"reasonable\" successors. For example \"load accumulator\" hardly ever follows \"enter accumulator.\" It turns out that if each instruction is allowed seven successors plus an \"escape instruction,\" only about one out of every five instructions needs to be an \"escape\" to get to one of the less usual successors. Seventy-five percent of the time the desired \"next instruction\" is among the seven permitted successors. Since each instruction has its own, possibly unique, set of successors, the interpretation of the stored op-code is conditional upon the state of the machine."

 "An analog computer patching program has been written as an extension to S/360 CSMP. This approach to patching programs has the advantage of providing patching information directly from a simulation run without appreciable extra effort on the part of the user."
"The partial-fractions expansion of a function F(s)/(s-a)m, m > 1, involves the computation of m coefficients, namely (1 /i!)(diF(a)/dsi), 0 ≤ i ≤ m-1. Wehrhahn [1] and Karni [3] have provided a method for computing these coefficients algebraically. A new approach is taken here which involves approximating a multiple pole by neighboring simple poles. The theory developed turns out to have a very interesting resemblance to the FFT algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated by several examples. Typical applications are finding the inverse Laplace transform of a function having multiple poles and the evaluation of higher order derivatives of an arbitrary function H(z) at some arbitrary z=z0."
"Some new procedures for designing efficient checking experiments for sequential machines are described. These procedures are based on the use of four types of sequences introduced, namely, the compound DS, the resolving sequence (RS), the compound. RS, and the simple I/O sequence. Significant reduction in the bound on the length of checking experiments is achieved. Along a parallel line of development, a new procedure, called the state counting method, is presented for detecting faults that can cause an increase in the number of states. For an n-state, m-input symbol machine, this procedure gives a bound on the length of checking experiments that is approximately mΔn. n times the bound for conventional checking experiments designed strictly under the assumption that no faults increase the number of states, where m > 1 and Δn is the maximum anticipated increase in the number of states due to faults."
"A machine representation of permanent memory faults is introduced where, if M is a sequential machine representing some fault free system, a memory fault is represented by a function μ on the states of M, and the result of the fault by an appropriately determined machine Mμ. Given this representation, the investigation is primarily concerned with faults that are tolerated (masked) in the sense that resulting behavior relates in some specified way to original behavior. Several types of fault masking are thus considered and conditions for their existence investigated. The restriction to a special class of stable faults is also studied, this class being of interest since it includes all faults which correspond to \"stuck-at\" failures in the memory cells of a sequential switching network."
"The efficient organization of a very large file to facilitate search and retrieval operations is an important but very complex problem. In this paper we consider the case of a large file in which the frequency of use of its component subfiles are known. We develop the organization of the file so that the average number of entries to locate individual items in it by means of binary search is minimized. The algorithm iteratively partitions the file into \"saturated\" subfiles, and with each successive iteration the average number of entries to locate an item is reduced until no more improvement is possible. Next, we extend the method to solve the realistic problem of designing an optimal memory hierarchy to hold the file in a computer system. The sizes of various memory components and location of various items of the frequency-dependent file are determined so that the average time to locate an item (over the totality of items) in the memory hierarchy is minimized for a given total cost of the memory system. A number of examples are given to elucidate the methods. Also, the characteristics and results of a Fortran implementation of the algorithms on the CDC 6600 are described."
"The design and the performance of a fast iterative analog computer that is based on the use of pulse-ratio modulation representation is presented. The basic element employed in the design of the computing units of the computer is a pulse-ratio modulator. The solution of an eigenvalue problem by the computer is presented as an example of its applications. The results obtained agree well with analytical calculations."
"A geometric model, termed an H diagram, is an effective visual aid in the synthesis of combinational logic circuits. The model is derived by means of coordinate transformations of a hypercube, resulting in a simple two-dimensional framework for mapping a binary function. The H diagram can be expanded to accommodate an arbitrary number of variables, while maintaining a mathematically consistent pattern that permits the extension of simple geometric interpretations to problems of more complexity. The effectiveness of the H diagram is demonstrated by applications that include the selection of prime implicants, expansion about arbitrary subfunctions, and transformation of variable sequences."
"The use of N-valued logics in the design of base N adder circuits is considered. Two types of N-valued logics are examined, Post N-valued logics and binary-coded N-valued logics. Specific implementations of these nonbinary logics are discussed. General formulas for the sum and carry functions of an adder are established in order to calculate the cost of base N adder stages using the Post logics. Relative costs of the base N adders using both types of N-valued logics are discussed in terms of a cost function. It is shown that for the model used, the binary-coded logics yield adders that have, in general, lower relative cost than comparabloe adders based on the Post logics, and that base 2 adders have a lower relative cost than the base N adders."
"The general problem of the use of context in computer character recognition is briefly reviewed. For the special case where the context is generated by a two-state stationary Markov chain, upper bounds are obtained for the average error probability of an optimal recognition procedure, based on compound decision functions. These bounds are nonparametric and simple functions of the \"differences\" between: 1) the a priori and transition probabilities of the context, and 2) the distributions of the measurements used to identify the characters. Some justiflcations, applications to systems design, and illustrative examples are given. An improvement is also obtained on a previously derived upper bound for procedures using no context."
"Using a technique based on \"state splitting\" it is shown that every n-state Markov system is decomposable into a whirl interconnection of n−1 two-state Markov systems."
"The bounds on state-set size in the proofs of the equivalence between nondeterministic and deterministic finite automata and between two-way and one-way deterministic finite automata are considered. It is shown that the number of states in the subset machine in the first construction cannot be reduced for certain cases. It is also shown that the number of states in the one-way automation constructed in the second proof may be reduced only slightly."
"A model of combinational switching circuits used as information processors is described. A set of entropies (in the information theory sense) can be associated with each completely specified function, and can be easily computed from the truth table representation for the function. It is shown that simple arithmetic relations between the magnitudes of these entropies are sufficient to identify monotonic and unate functions and functions realizable as a unate cascade. In the latter case, a simple test identifies unate cascade realizable functions and gives the set of possible orderings of variables in the realization."

"This book is intended as a textbook for an introductory course in computer organization for undergraduates at universities and junior colleges. Its aims are given by the following sentences in the preface."
"The term microprogramming is most often used to describe the technique of designing a digital computer control unit to execute a sequence of control words called microinstructions. These microinstructions are usually stored in a separate control memory, and each microinstruction usually specifies the machine control signals for one processor cycle time. Husson uses the term microprogramming in this hardware sense and also in a software sense to describe the act of programming the microinstruction sequences."
"The contents of this book are well suited to the title. The book is concise. It contains a great deal of information, and pricewise it is certainly a bargain per topic covered. The 17 chapters are grouped into three parts. The first, Elementary Linear Programming (LP), requires knowledge of elementary algebra. There is occasional use of matrix notation, but only Chapter 7, the last in the first part, involves significant use of matrix algebra."
"Since the release in August 1968 of the APL/ 360 interpretive time-sharing system, the algebraic language called APL has gained many enthusiastic users. Users of APL consist of those who use it as a desk calculator, as a tool for programming and calculating complex mathematical functions, to define and simulate computer systems, to teach elementary and secondary school children, to teach engineering, to edit technical papers, and to carry out many other tasks with varying degrees of complexity. A novice in the use of the APL will find the book very helpful as a guide to concepts and use of an APL terminal system for solving simple and complex problems."

"Fault tolerance has become an important design parameter of fourth generation computing systems. A brief overview of significant accomplishments in fault detection and location, reliability modeling, analysis and architecture, and some comments on software aspects of reliable computation are provided. A few promising areas for future investigation are described."
"An algorithm for generating the complete test set of each stuck-at-0 (s-a-0) and stuck-at-1 (s-a-1) single fault in a combinational logic circuit is presented. The algorithm has been programmed to handle large circuits and is based on some properties of Boolean differences that make the generation of the complete test set very efficient. This algorithm can be modified so that it can be programmed on computers with small storage space. The modified algorithm can efficiently generate a subset of the complete test set of each of the faults under consideration. Some discussion is given to provide some insight into the relationship among undetectable faults, tests for detectable single faults, and circuit redundancies. Some ideas on the construction of test sets for detecting multiple faults based on Boolean differences are presented."
"The important problem of generating test patterns to detect multiple faults has received little attention, mainly due to their computational complexity. The theoretical results of this paper show that near minimal tests for multiple faults can be generated with complexity of computation comparable to that of single faults."
"Programmed algorithms for test generation and test evaluation are described. The D-notation is introduced and a test generator (DALG) for combinational logic is presented. The sequential case is then examined. \"Real life\" constraints related to LSI testing are discussed. Two heuristic test generators satisfying these constraints are introduced. The iterative test generator (ITG) generates tests by transforming the given sequential circuit into an iterative combinational circuit. The macroblock test generator (MTG) uses the same approach but makes use of complex primitives (latches, triggers, etc.) to represent the circuit to be tested. Both the ITG and the MTG are not always guaranteed to generate good tests for each examined failure, and are used in connection with a test evaluator (simulator). Basic features of this evaluator are discussed."
"A derivation of test sets S0and S1for irredundant unate logical circuits is presented. It is shown that these sets (S0and S1, respectively) detect all stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults in all realizations with no internal inverters of a given unate function. They can be obtained easily from the minimum sum and minimum product forms, from a Karnaugh map, or from a Hasse diagram of the function. These sets are minimum in the sense that there is no set with a smaller number of elements that detects all faults in the class of realizations of a logical function. In particular, it is found that a two-level AND–OR (OR–AND) network needs all the tests in S0(S1)."
"A fail-safe sequential machine is one that produces safe-side output when failures occur in the machine. This paper presents a new method of realization of fail-safe sequential machines under the following assumptions: 1) failure is caused by a single fault of element in the machine, 2) output of faulty element is stuck at one or zero, and 3) input does not malfunction."
"The problem of fault detection and diagnosis of irredundant multiple-output combinational networks is discussed from a purely structural viewpoint, i.e., with the functions of the network components essentially ignored. Two structural models for a network are given in the form of labeled directed graphs. Graph theoretic concepts are introduced, and theorems are developed which give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the detectability of faults at particular primary outputs based solely on the structure of the network. Procedures are then presented for obtaining the structural diagnostic resolution for both line and logic module faults. Finally, an application, test point placement for increased network maintainability, is considered."
"This paper is a study of the effects of faults on the logical operation of combinational (acyclic) logic circuits. In particular, the conditions whereby two different faults can produce the same alteration in the circuit behavior are investigated. This relationship between two faults is shown to be an equivalence relation, and three different types of equivalence relations are specified. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these equivalence relations are proved. An algorithm for determining the equivalence classes for one of the types of equivalence is presented. Other types of algebraic properties of faults are discussed."
"In previous papers [3]–[5] the authors considered the application of graph theory to represent and analyze a computer system. From such analysis of the graph (thus the system), we have shown that faults can be detected and located by means of strategically placed test points within the system."
"Recovery in a fault-tolerant computer means the continuation of system operation with data integrity after an error occurs. This paper delineates two parallel concepts embodied in the hardware and software functions required for recovery; detection, diagnosis, and reconfiguration for hardware, data integrity, checkpointing, and restart for the software. The hardware relies on the recovery variable set, checking circuits, and diagnostics, and the software relies on the recovery information set, audit, and reconstruct routines, to characterize the system state and assist in recovery when required. Of particular utility is a handware unit, the recovery control unit, which serves as an interface between error detection and software recovery programs in the supervisor and provides dynamic interactive recovery."
"Reliability modeling and the mathematical equations involved are discussed for general computer systems organized to be fault tolerant. This paper summarizes the work done over the last four years on mathematical reliability modeling by the authors."
"This paper presents the results obtained in a continuing investigation of fault-tolerant computing which is being conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Initial studies led to the decision to design and construct an experimental computer with dynamic (standby) redundancy, including replaceable subsystems and a program rollback provision to eliminate transient errors. This system, called the STAR computer, began operation in 1969. The following aspects of the STAR system are described: architecture, reliability analysis, software, automatic maintenance of peripheral systems, and adaptation to serve as the central computer of an outerplanet exploration spacecraft."
"The application of error-detecting or error-correcting codes in digital computer design requires studies of cost and effectiveness trade-offs to supplement the knowledge of their theoretical properties. General criteria for cost and effectiveness studies of error codes are developed, and results are presented for arithmetic error codes with the low-cost check modulus 2a-1. Both separate (residue) and nonseparate (AN) codes are considered. The class of multiple arithmetic error codes is developed as an extension of low-cost single codes."
"This paper formally describes a technique for proving that computer programs will always execute correctly. In order to do this, an abstract model for a program and its execution is given. Then, correctness of programs and proofs of correctness of programs are defined with respect to that model."
"This paper is a survey of the open Soviet literature in the technical areas relevant to the design of complex digital systems that must exhibit a high degree of reliability. Particular emphasis is on the various techniques for the constructive application of redundancy in order to achieve the reliability necessary for the successful realization of machines of high computational power and high availability. Overall conclusions are drawn regarding the nature and significance of Soviet activities in these fields. The rather extensive bibliography upon which these observations are based is included as a stimulus and aid in further research and inquiry into the results already available in these technical areas."
"Techniques for deriving the minimum length tests are developed for irredundant combinational circuits that contain single faults. The development is based on the Boolean difference function. The Boolean difference function is expanded to form two analytical expressions that can be used to calculate the tests for any stuck-at-zero and stuck-at-one fault within combinational circuits."
"The progress in integrated circuits or large-scale integration (LSI) has increased the difficulty of testing and diagnosis. This paper extends the early results of using Boolean difference to generate test patterns for sequential circuits. The theory described in this paper is based on an extended Boolean difference definition, which gives a solution to the problem of automatic generation of test patterns for asynchronous sequential circuits. A complete program written in Fortran has been tested on various examples. Results are very close to the theoretical expectation."
"This paper considers the design of diagnosable combinational networks. The diagnosability criterion used here requires that the single fault detection test set for the network also detects all multiple faults. Several recent studies in the area of multiple fault diagnosis are reviewed and the results which are pertinent to this investigation are summarized. It is shown that, under certain conditions, internal fan-out may be present without adversely affecting the detection of multiple faults. These results suggest design techniques which lead to readily diagnosable networks."
"Two procedures are presented for generating fault detection test sequences for large sequential circuits. In the adaptive random procedure one can achieve a tradeoff between test generation time, length, and percent of circuit tested. An algorithmic path-sensitizing procedure is also presented. Both procedures employ a three-valued logic system. Some experimental results are given."
"A method is described for quantitatively expressing the performance of a redundancy scheme by two parameters, the reliability improvement index and the \"cost\" factor, which are defined so as to be independent of the size of system to which they are applied. The reliability improvement index is a sensitive measure of the reliability increase produced by applying the redundancy scheme, and is relatively easy to evaluate by considering failure modes in a small representative part of the system. The two parameters permit a comparative assessment of redundancy schemes, and some results for a selection of redundancy schemes are presented. The reliability improvement index can also be used to estimate redundant system reliability."
"The processes of protective redundancy, namely, standby replacement (SR) redundancy and hybrid redundancy (a combination of SR and multiple-line voting redundancy), find application in the architecture of fault-tolerant digital computers and enable them to be ultrareliable and self-repairing. The claims to ultrareliability lead to the challenge of quantitatively evaluating and assigning a value to the probability of survival as a function of the mission durations intended. This note presents various mathematical models, and derives and displays quantitative evaluations of system reliability as a function of various mission parameters of interest to the system designer."
"A self-reconfigurable and fault-tolerant computer has been realized in Electronique Marcel Dassault Laboratories in France. It is a microprogrammed character-coded computer using a READ-WRITE microprogram memory. A special Hamming code is used for character encoding. The arithmetic operators are table operators mounted in a duplex scheme. Logical operators use gate connector redudancy. Counters and registers use random redundancy, i.e., any spare part, selected in a waiting list, can replace any failed part having the same function. These different parts of the computer, their design criteria, and the computer architecture are described in detail. The computer needs about three times more components than a conventional computer."
"Two basic factors influence the design of highly reliable computer systems: the amount of failures required to be tolerated and the reliability or MTBF required. A computer system designed to tolerate any three single failures in a fail-operational–fail-operational–fail-safe manner for a real-time control application is presented. The design approach uses adaptive majority voting in both hardware and software with a four-level redundant system. Various methods of performing the adaptive majority voting functions were evaluated with the selected approach using a special module termed a voter–comparator switch (VCS). The VCS module allows the computer system to be operated in a variety of redundant modes, depending on the failure tolerance required at any particular time."
"A distributed fault-tolerant information processing system is proposed, comprising a central multiprocessor, dedicated local processors, and multiplexed input–output buses connecting them together. The processors in the multiprocessor are duplicated for error detection, which is felt to be less expensive than using coded redundancy of comparable effectiveness. Error recovery is made possible by a triplicated scratchpad memory in each processor. The main multiprocessor memory uses replicated memory for error detection and correction. Local processors use any of three conventional redundancy techniques: voting, duplex pairs with backup, and duplex pairs in independent subsystems."
"A formal analysis procedure for hardware and software computer systems is described. A system is described by a flow table model. The concept of an output hazard is introduced to account for effects of unbounded line delays. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of output hazards are given. A system that contains no output hazards is said to operate correctly if the system state graph that describes all system states and state transitions is free from forbidden states and forbidden state sequences. A flow table solution for the two-component mutual exclusion problem is analyzed and shown to be correct."
"A formal model for the study of reliable combinational networks is introduced and used to determine network properties conducive to the location of faults. The usual concept of fault location is generalized to be an interval on the partially ordered set of subsets of network nodes that classifies nodes into three disjoint sets: a faulty set, a fault-free set, and an indeterminate set. After developing basic properties of locatable faults, necessary and sufficient conditions for a fault to be locatable in an arbitrary network are stated and proven."
"A method is given of designing a simple self-checking and self-testing decoder checking circuit which uses much less circuitry than previous checkers. An analysis is given of the circuit savings and of the probability of erroneous decoder operation before error detection."

"The problem of designing asynchronous circuits where the changes in binary input signals occur independently of one another is discussed. If several input changes occur within some interval δ1, the circuit behaves as though the changes were simultaneous. If consecutive changes are spaced by intervals exceeding some longer interval δ2 then the circuit reacts as though a sequence of single changes had occurred. But when the spacing is between these values, the system may react in an unsatisfactory manner unless special attention is paid to the problem during the design process. Constraints imposed by this problem on the row assignment and on the delay elements are derived."
"A straightforward efficient computer algorithm for synthesizing multiple-output NAND (NOR) switching networks is presented which takes practical fan-in and fan-out limitations of logic gates into account. The algorithm is highly iterative and hence is very suitable for realizing large-size switching functions by a digital computer. The algorithm has been programmed in Fortran and a great deal of statistical data has been obtained to demonstrate its efficiency in terms of gate count as well as computing time. It is also efficient for hand execution"
"A heuristic procedure for partitioning or mapping a set of interconnected blocks into subsets called modules is presented. Each module may be constrained in terms of the number of blocks and/or the number of intermodule connections that it can accommodate. The procedure allows given blocks to be mapped to more than one module in order to reduce the number of modules required if such reduction is desirable. Results obtained from applying the procedure, by means of a computer program, to the partitioning and mapping of computer logic gates into chips and cards are presented."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of determining, by means of terminal experiments, whether a given combinational switching circuit operates correctly or is impaired by some malfunction. We shall be primarily concerned with permanent faults due to component failures. It is assumed that other methods will be employed to protect the circuit against the effects of transient faults. A procedure is presented for the detection of failures in combinational switching circuits. The procedure provides minimal sets of tests for two-level circuits and nearly minimal sets of tests for most multilevel circuits."
"Partitions of the set of blocks of a computer logic graph, also called a block graph, into subsets called modules demonstrate that a two-region relationship exists between P, the average number of pins per module, and B, the average number of blocks per module. In the first region, P = KBr, where K is the average number of pins per block and 0.57 ≤ r ≤ 0.75. In the second region, that is, where the number of modules is small (i.e., 1-5), P is less than predicted by the above formula and is given by a more complex relationship. These conclusions resulted from controlled partitioning experiments performed using a computer program to partition four logic graphs varying in size from 500 to 13 000 circuits representing three different computers. The size of a block varied from one NOR circuit in one of the block graphs to a 30-circuit chip in one of the other block graphs."
"the general study of the conversion of a number from the radix p to the radix q number system leads to four different algorithms for integers, and to four similar ones for fractions. Most transform algorithms can be implemented by iterative arrays of cells characterized by simple equations. Such arrays are very attractive with present-time large-scale integration technology."
"A generalized record organization is proposed from which many flxed and variable length records of hierarchical and network formats can be derived. In developing the generalization, attempts are made to characterize the record organization. By identifying the characteristics of the record organization, it is possible to segregate, for storage, the global record structural information from the local and nonstructural information. Such a segregation can lead to more efficient use of storage, ease of reorganizing the records, and the possibility of multiple organizations for the same set of records. A scheme for specifying the generalized record organization is provided and illustrated."
"A network model colled the normal NAND model is introduced for the study of fault diagnosis in combinational logic circuits. It is shown that every network can be transformed into an equivalent normal NAND network from which all the information pertaining to the diagnosis of the original network con be obtained. The use of this model greatly simplifies fault analysis and test generation."
"This paper considers the design of combinational logic circuits which require a minimal or near-minimal number of tests. Bounds on the number of tests required by various network structures are considered. It is shown that for an n-input fanout-free network, the number of single and multiple fault detection test lies between 2 √n and n + 1, while the number of fault locations tests lies between 2 √n and 2n."
"A few classes of codes, suitable for error correction in high-speed memory systems, are presented. The codes have relatively simple parallel decoding nets. The codes may be used for the correction of both temporary and catastrophic errors."
"This paper discusses methods of estimating the probability of error for the Bayes' classifier which must be designed and tested with a finite number of classified samples. The expected difference between estimates is discussed. A simplifled algorithm to compute the leaving-one-out method is proposed for multivariate normal distributions wtih unequal co-variance matrices. The discussion is extended to nonparametric classifiers by using the Parzen approximation for the density functions. Experimental results are shown for both parametric and nonparametric cases."
"A system intended to provide input of printed text to computers is applied to published patents, annotated law reports, and technical journals."
"In recent years, considerable interest has been given to the study of threshold logic. This interest stems primarily from the possible economic savings associated with the use of threshold elements in realizing arbitrary switching functions. Such realizations, for the most part, depend on successfully finding threshold functions that closely approximate the given function. Closeness of approximation as defined here means that the approximating threshold function has the smallest set of error vectors with respect to the given function."
"A general method is presented for the computation of the fast Fourier transform from data stored in external auxiliary memory, for any general radix r = 2nn ≥e external data storage is necessitated whenever the internal computer memory is limited. The general radix requirement arises in the tradeoff in serial FFT processor machines, between the number of passes required to address storage and the number of equivalent sparse matrix multiplicative operations required to compute the fast Fourier transform."
"A simple theory based on linear approximation of the transient waveform and on the superposition theorem permits the prediction of waveforms and amplitude of the ripple voltage at the receiving end of a line which transmits pulses with finite rise time and which is mismatched at both ends. The influence of every connection in a digital system can be determined in this way."
"Based on a program-proving technique, a method for proving sequential machine designs is presented. The method associates with each state of the machine an assertion about the sequences taking the machine into that state. The design is proved by: showing all assertions true irrespective of state changes; and deriving the design specifications from the assertions at final states. The method is illustrated' on two finite automata."
"As computer CPUs get faster, primary memories tend to be organized in parallel banks. The fastest machines now being developed can fetch of the order of 100 words in parallel. Unless memory and compiler designers are careful, serious memory conflicts and resulting performance degradation may result. Some of the important questions of design and use of such memories are discussed."
"Past studies of the performance of interleaved memory systems are extended in this note by adopting a more general model. The model assumes a system of N memory modules, each of which is made up of b submodules. Successive memory addresses are assigned to sequential submodules, modulo Nb. For increased effective memory bandwidth a so-called conflict buffer of size L + 1 is assumed to exist for storing address conflicts."
"This note describes a cellular array that computes the product of two arbitrary elements of the Galois field GF(2m). The regularity of this array should make it attractive for LSI fabrication."
"It is well known that there is a possible tradeoff in the binary representation of floating-point numbers in which one bit of accuracy can be gained at the cost of halving the exponent range, and vice versa. A way in which the exponent range can be greatly increased while preserving full accuracy for most computations is suggested."
"A method of determining the number of responders to a search in an associative memory is presented. It is shown that less than one full adder per memory cell is required and that the maximum delay in establishing the count is proportional to n, where n is the log to the base 3 of the number of memory cells."
"This note presents a method for designing and implementing a dynamic priority assignment memory-access conflict-resolution circuit for use in multiprocessing systems with K processors. A decision rule which establishes the priority, assignment is given and an example which illustrates the techniques is also discussed."
"Although integrated-circuit technology promises to reduce the cost of logic, there are still situations where low-cost multiplication and/or division algorithms must be implemented in today's technology. This can be accomplished by the algorithms presented here: repetitive addition (subtraction) algorithms for multiplication (division), employing a right shift. The result of the operation is truncated, which limits the accurqcy but reduces significantly the amount of intermediate storage required. The degree of accuracy is quite adequate for selected applications."
"Modified Meggitt methods (pseudodivision methods) are suggested for evaluating logarithm, arctan, and square root. The modifications described here consist in restricting the magnitude of the pseudopartial remainsler such that the pseudoquotient assumes a form close to the minimal representation in the radix of choice. These methods will become useful for large-scale integrated system design."
"A method is introduced for deciding the class of a pattern described by a vector of measured features. Memory requirements and the time required for classifying a pattern are not excessive, even when there are many classes and many multilevel feature measurements. Two initial steps use univariate distributions of the measurements to select, for a pattern in question, a small subset of neighboring classes. If the pattern is one used in deriving the distributions, its true class is certain to be in the selected subset. The final step distinguishes among the members, if there are more than one, of the subset by using discriminants derivable by classic methods. The technique is tested experimentally on a set of about 26 000 alphabetic characters of nine type fonts. The characters range widely in quality. One third are taken as training patterns from which histograms for the first two steps and discriminants for the third step are derived. The rest are used to test the method. The features used are the characteristic loci."
"The reject and error rates of a certain hierarchical decision structure are derived under assumptions of statistical independence among the members of the hierarchy. It is shown that high decision reliability can be obtained with much more relaxed requirements on the individual recognizers in the hierarchy."
"Upper and lower bounds are derived for the number of pseudothreshold functions of n variables. (Pseudothershold logic is a generalization of threshold logic.) It is shown that a lower bound on the number of pseudothreshold functions P(n) of exactly n variables realized by zero-free structures is The number of pseudothreshold functions Q(n) of n variables realized by nontrivial structures is bounded by It is also proven that is a lower bound on the number of positive functions of exactly n variables."
"It is known that any switching function can be written as a totally symmetric function with some of its variables being repetitive. In this note, the least upper bound for the number of variables of the transformed totally symmetric functions based on the partition on the set of variables induced by the partial symmetry of the given switching function is found, and a technique for obtaining a transformed totally symmetric function with the number of variables equal to the least upper bound is given."
"An algorithm for identifying all redundant variables of switching functions and an algorithm for identifying their symmetries (total or partial) are presented. Both algorithms are straightforward and very efficient. These algorithms are based on manipulating the binary and decimal number representations of the minterms of the switching function under testing."
"A recent paper by Sammon1 describes a useful technique for analyzing data and helping find clusters. It consists of a nonlinear mapping of the original data into two dimensions (for visual inspection) which is superior for many purposes to use of the first two principal components. The present correspondence points out that essentially the same mapping can be achieved by a widely used, easily obtainable computer propram for multidimensional scaling called M-D-SCAL."
"One of the major areas in switching theory research has been concerned with obtaining suitable algorithrns for the minimization of Boolean functions in connection with the general problem of their economic realization. A solution of the minimization problem, in general, involves consideration of two distinct phases. In the first phase all the prime implicants of the function are found, while in the second phase, from this set of all the prime implicants, a minimal subset (according to some criterion of minimality) of prime implicants is selected such that their disjunction is equivalent to the function and from which none of the prime implicants can be dropped without sacrificing equivalence. Many different algorithms exist for solving both the first and the second phase of this minimization problem. In a recent paper,' Slagle et al. describe a new algorithm for the generation of all the prime implicants of a Boolean function. As claimed by the authors, this algorithm is different from those previously given in the literature. The algorithm is efficient, does not generate the same prime implicant more than once (though the algorithm sometimes generates some non-prime implicants), and does not need large capacity of memory for implementation on a digital computer. The algorithm works equally well with either the conjunctive or the disjunctive (both canonical and noncanonical) form of the function."
"In the above paper,1Fukunaga and Olsen present an alternative method of estimating the intrinsic dimensionality of data. Their proposed algorithm differs from others in that it relies heavily on operator interaction and provides a method of specifying variable local regions. The authors state: \" This variability is critical as the practical problem of determining dimensionality depends on the size and number of samples in the local regions.\" This is illustrated in their summary Table II (B), in which, for local region sizes containing five and ten samples, the indicated dimensionalities are one and three, respectively, when using the 1 percent eigenvalue criterion; and one and two, respectively, when using the 10 percent criterion. While the authors may have a decision rule to select the correct answer from the summary table, I did not see it in their paper; and without such a rule, I do not believe the problem has been solved satisfactorily."
"In the statistical method proposed by Trunk [2], [3], he calculates the density function p(X|N) where X= [xl. .. xn,]Tis the observed random vector and N(= 1, 2,...) is the intrinsic number of parameters for the random vector. The most likely N for the observed vectors is determined by applying the multihypotheses test to these density functions. The number of random variables are reduced by using sufficient statistics such as the ratios of local distances and certain angles between local vectors, rather than the original x1,...,xn."
"It is shown that a single-output Moore-type n-state linear machine may be realized with no more than 2n copies of the AND–OR-delay (AOD) module of Newborn, Weiner, and Hopcroft. This bound is significantly lower than that for arbitrary single-output Moore-type machines, which is 2n."
"A recent definition of Walsh functions is not new. An earlier version contains a proof that the above-mentioned note lacks."
 "An alternative cellular array design is described for nonrestoring extraction of square roots. The array uses a single type of adder/ subtractor cell with a near-iterative connection pattern."

"This book represents an interesting attempt to take an overall view of a data system defined by the author as \"the artifact that consists of a digital computer, a control program, and an accessible library of programs and data.\" His intended audience are professionals in the computer industry whose pursuit of specialized vocations leads them away from systematic consideration of the data system as a whole. His avowed aim is \"crispness in style and frugality in detail.\" Consequently this book covers a good deal of ground—sometimes very briefly."

"An algorithm is presented which enables certain matrix multiplications in a digital computer to be implemented with a considerable savings in storage and computational operations. For NxN matrix vector multiplication (that is a multiplication of a matrix by a vector) a maximum of N Σn-1 r=0 pr, storage words are necessary compared to normal full matrix storage requirements of N2locations. In addition only N Σn-1 r=0 Pr, computer operations are necessary compared to N2operation in a general vector matrix multiplication. N is chosen to be a highly composite number, N= πn-1 r=0 pr, and the pr, are integers. The algorithm takes advantage of the redundancies in the definition of certain matrices and develops a matrix description based on the number of degrees of freedom necessary in defining an NxN matrix. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that it describes a vector matrix multiplication in exactly as many operations as available degrees of freedom N σn-1 r=0 Pr(no greater number of degrees of freedom could be implemented in fewer operations). The matrix transformation formulation is based largely on noting the use of lexicographic positional digit notation in keeping track of the few parameters describing the final N by N matrix. The algorithm includes the generation of the fast Fourier transform, fast Hadamard transform, fast Walsh transform, fast Kronecker matrix transform, and an infinite class of transformations unnamed but potentially useful in generalized spectral analysis as well as coding, bandwidth reduction, and feature selection."
"A sequential machine that processes its inputs without changing state can be represented as a constrained combinational network. A system of Boolean equations that represent such a network must include assertions that formalize the required constraints. These constraints can be expressed as assertions about certain gate inputs and certain gate outputs within the network. In such networks, redundant and partially redundant gates are not pathological. The fault analysis method presented provides for the testing of both sides of an irredundant gate and for the detectable side of a partially redundant gate."
"A regular expression is called unambiguous if every tape in the event can be generated from the expression in one way only. The flow-graph technique for constructing an expression is shown to preserve ambiguities of the graph, and thus, if the graph is that of a deterministic automaton, the expression is unambiguous. A procedure for generating a nondeterministic automaton which preserves the ambiguities of the given regular expression is described. Finally, a procedure for testing whether a given expression is ambiguous is given."
"Given a vector of N elements, the perfect shuffle of this vector is a permutation of the elements that are identical to a perfect shuffle of a deck of cards. Elements of the first half of the vector are interlaced with elements of the second half in the perfect shuffle of the vector."
"This paper describes a modular approach of implementing the control circuitry. It is achieved by the use of multifunctional binary decoder circuits in conjunction with a transistor array high-speed READ-ONLY memory."
"Modern digital computing systems are primarily limited in how densely information may be recorded on the magnetic storage elements by the manner in which the information is retrieved (detected) from these storage facilities. Current systems store information at a density around 1000 bits per inch (bit/in); system elements, other than the detection process, could easily handle densities in excess of 3000 bit/in. This paper describes the signal present at the output of the read-write head and suggests two systems by which detection at high bit densities may be accomplished. The error rate associated with each system is given and the results are applied to a computer system using a magnetic disk file as the storage element. It is demonstrated that these detection procedures can meet the widely accepted standard of one error in one billion bits at reasonable signal-to-noise ratios."
"An algorithm for the analysis of multivariant data is presented along with some experimental results. The basic idea of the method is to examine the data in many small subregions, and from this determine the number of governing parameters, or intrinsic dimensionality. This intrinsic dimensionality is usually much lower than the dimensionality that is given by the standard Karhunen-Loève technique. An analysis that demonstrates the feasability of this approach is presented."
"Armstrong et al.[1] have shown how critical races and function hazards can be suppressed in asynchronous sequential circuits by using gate delays to advantage rather than introducing explicit delay elements, if certain delay assumptions are satisfied. This paper shows that the same techniques may be used to design circuits which will respond reliably to simultaneous changes of several input variables."
"This paper deals with the problem of finding nontrivial periodic representations, with not necessarily null transient duration, of deterministic sequential machines. The well-known results in this area, based on means of d-equivalence partitions or regular d-partitions on the set of internal states of a sequential machine A, are generalized. Apart from this, the problem of finding nontrivial periodic representations of A is solved here by the well-known methods of input-independent partitions on the set of internal states of A and by the operation of the (τ, T) numeration introduced here."
"A new model for stochastic sequential machines is introduced. This model consists of a deterministic Mealy-type synchronous sequential machine some of whose inputs are random number generators while the outputs of another set of random number generators are used to perturb the output function of the deterministic Mealy machine. Thus this model is physically realizable in terms of random number generators, logic and memory elements. It is shown that this model and the Shannon model of a stochastic sequential machine are coextensive and a procedure is given, through a proof of this result, for obtaining one from the other. The model given here is then compared with the realizable model introduced by Nieh and Carlyle [1] and it is shown that their model and ours may be realized with identical random number generators for the case of input-state calculable stochastic sequential machines."
"The complexity of the switching networks necessary to realize arbitrary combinational functions is studied. Asymptotic upper and lower bounds for fully defined functions are well known, while lower bounds also exist for partially defined combinational functions. The present paper supplements these results with the upper bounds for the partially defined functions. The results have possible relevance to pattern recognition."
"This paper discusses limitations which arise when a method proposed by Miura et al. [1] is used for solving certain two-point boundary value problems on the hybrid computer. It is shown that the method proposed in [1] will not work in all cases. An example where the method fails is given. However, to emphasize the basic elegance and usefulness of this method, an extension to cover a more general target set is also introduced."
"A simple method is presented which defines Walsh functions in terms of products of Rademacher functions, but which preserves the ordering of the Walsh functions necessary to retain the notion of increasing number of zero crossings, or sequency."
"The nonrestoring division algorithm offers the advantages of speed and logical simplicity when working with signed, two's-complement binary numbers. The algorithm does not assure sign agreement between the calculated quotient and remainder, however, which is a disadvantage in some applications. This paper describes a postcorrection that will force sign agreement between quotient and remainder. The corrective operation is very simple to implement, especially in microprogrammed arithmetic units."
"An iterative array for multiplication of signed binary numbers is described. It uses controlled adder-subtractor cells. The negative numbers are in two's complement form and the product, if negative, is also available in this form without requiring any additional operations."
"An approach to clustering and decision making is presented where a prior problem knowledge is inserted interactively. The problem knowledge inserted is in the form of subcategory mean vectors and covariance matrices and in the expert's confidence that these means and covariances accurately characterize the category. Then observations of patterns from the category are used to update these a priori supplied means and covariances. The extent to which new observations update the a priori values depends upon the expert's a priori confidence."
"An algorithm called the accelerated relaxation method for finding a solution of a set of inequalities is given. Experimental results show that the accelerated relaxation method is far more efficient than the relaxation method, the fixed increment method, and the generalized-inverse Ho-Kashyap algorithm."
"A circuit for generating a clock pulse for asynchronous circuits is given, and when used with transition sensitive flip-flops eliminates critical races for an arbitrary state assignment. Thus the minimum number of internal variables may be used. Furthermore, logic and sequential hazards will not affect the circuit performance."
"The construction described in this note makes possible the generation of any given linear shift register sequence of maximal period p= 2n-1, at a rate k times faster than the shift pulse rate. The construction is valid for any positive integer k which is not a multiple of p and it employs at most k linear shift registers of degree n or less."
"The state reduction of sequential networks is achieved by selecting a minimal set of prime C-classes satisfying the cover and closure requirements. The derivation of all the C-classes and subsequent prime C-classes has been illustrated by Grasselli and Luccio [1] and relies on maximal C-class decomposition. In this note, an alternative method for deriving the prime C-classes is described. The method does not involve the maximal C-classes and is algorithmically easier to implement."
"The problem of solving sequential Boolean equations is examined in terms of nondeterministic finite transducers. An upper bound for the delay is established and a method for obtaining a deterministic equivalent is described."
"A method is described for synthesizing bilateral switching networks using a topological solution that does not employ algebraic or linear graph techniques. Using the eye as a pattern detector, one may trace an optimum path directly on the truth table from the input to the one or more desired outputs. This method overcomes many of the difficulties that have been encountered with relay contact logic, and at the same time helps the logician seek a planar symmetrical solution thaat is so desirable for monolithic circuits composed of MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) devices."
"The definitions of input-memory and output-memory of a sequential machine are examined and an attempt is made to clarify some, confusion in the literature regarding the concepts of input-memort and output-memory."

"In this paper we develop methods of segmenting a large system into smaller subsystems so that the letter can be diagnosed in parallel. Two basic techniques called serial segmentation and parallel segmentation are introduced. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed for the purpose of reducing the complexity and the size of the large subsystem."
"This paper derives and discusses statistical properties (probability density function, moments, power spectrum, and autocorrelation function) of waveforms obtained by nonrecursive digital filtering of pseudorandom linear binary sequences. This filtering may be achieved in practice by forming a weighted summation of binary digits passing along a shift register."
"This paper deals with a sequential decision model for selecting feature subsets in pattern recognition. Based upon this model, a number of selection strategies are proposed and their properties are investigated. The basic criterion of these selection strategies, which depend only on the last r (r finite) recognition samples, is to maximize the long-run proportion of correct recognition, the maximization being overall possible feature subsets. The sequential model is particularly suitable for the implementation of on-line selection processes often required in pattern recognition. A character recognition experiment has been simulated on a digital computer to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach."
"This paper gives a unified approach for describing various systematic ways of using built-in delays in normal fundamental mode circuits. The transition of the circuit from one total stable state to another is characterized by the constraints imposed upon the next-state functions, and the realization method is characterized by the conditions under which these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously."
"A class of linear algebraic structures over the set of Boolean functions is presented. Afterwards, from these structures a new one is studied—the right-weak algebra. By using the properties of this algebra, some new results are established about the commutativity of the superposition, the ideals, the annulators, and the properties of the iteration."
"An algorithm for obtaining all simple disjunctive decompositions of a switching function is described. It operates on a function given as an expression using the operations AND, EXCLUSIVE OR, and complementation. It uses necessary conditions for the existence of a decomposition to eliminate sets of bound sets from consideration. Thus this technique differs from existing methods in that it attempts to test fewer bound sets at the expense of additional analysis. The algorithm can also be applied to functions given in a canonical form. It is shown that for a collection of functions of n variables chosen at random, the time required grows as n3. Previous methods, on the other hand, have an exponential growth rate."
"The purpose of this note is to show as clearly as possible the mathematical relationship between the two basic fast methods used for the calculation of discrete Fourier transforms and to generalize one of the methods a little further. This method applies to all those linear transformations whose matrices are expressible as direct products."
"A new type of fixed-cell fixed-interconnection homogeneous cellular array that is capable of realizing any switching network is developed. The array is composed of identical combinational logic cells with three inputs and three outputs. The logic cells are arranged in a rectangular array with uniform interconnection structure. The signal flow is unilateral in the vertical direction and bilateral in the horizontal direction. Each n-column array is capable of realizing any set of n functions of n variables. The functional capabilities of the array can be changed by appropriately setting the parameters on the edges of the array. Algorithms for the realization of a set of n functions of n variables by using this type of array are presented."
"A procedure is given for the construction of a von Neumann neighborhood iterative array to simulate a Moore neighborhood array in real time for the cases of up to three-dimensional arrays. The increase in the typical machine complexity accompanying this neighborhood complexity reduction is significantly less than that found in the general n-dimensional study of Cole [1]."
"The basic properties and realization of failsafe combinational logic nets and failsafe sequential machines are discussed. The present note concerns totally asymmetric faiiure nets which are composed only of (+) elements and/ or (-) elements, where a (+) element is an asymmetric failure element which never fails to logical zero and a (-) element is defined similarly."
"We investigate the spectral component at a desired frequency (f= p/2q) of two-level waveforms constrained to change level only at integer values of time. We conclude that the component at the frequency is maximized if and only if the level changes coincide with the pulses of a smooth sequence of rate p/q."
"A special aspect of sequential machine identification is treated in this paper. Given an input signal sequence to an unknown sequential machine and the resulting output signal sequence of the machine, it is necessary to find a state table or any other description of the machine and all other machines which response to the given input sequence with the given output sequence. The main objective of the research was to develop a fast and efficient state merging method which profits from the special characteristics of the problem at hand."
"The goal of this note is to present a new logical variable, the \"degree of freedom,\" which is more refined than the usual Boolean variable, and also the very general algebra which may be formulated using the concept of \"degree of freedom.\""
"This note presents a method for identifying total or partial symmetry of switching functions based on the application of the principle of residue test by numerical methods. The invariance of a switching function under a single interchange of two variables can be readily detected from the equality of some of the residues of expansion about these two variables. This procedure of detecting invariance is directly applied for the identification of total or partial symmetry of a switching function whose variables of symmetry may be either all unprimed (or all primed), mixed, or of multiform nature."
"There exist a number of methods for finding minimal or nonminimal irredundant solutions of switching functions. Recently in a paper by Marcovitz and Shub, an improved algorithm for simplifying switching functions using a Karnaugh map is suggested. The present study extends the basic idea of the authors in finding minimal and nonminimal irredundant solutions by using the cover table representation of switching functions instead of the map."
"An algorithm for the conversion of BCD numbers to numbers in the -2 radix system is presented. This algorithm consists of simple arithmetic operations such as division by two and addition of the constants one and five. These operations may easily be performed in a -2 radix computer by shifting a number right for division by two and a table look-up procedure for the additions. The reverse conversion is also briefly discussed"
"It is shown how index registers can be made so as to act parallel to the computer instruction flow, thus not requiring a programmed instruction to decrement (or increment) and jump. This method would save one instruction per loop but would require more hardware."

 "In this paper, a heuristic state assignment algorithm for asynchronous sequential machines is presented. Machines realized by this assignment scheme will result in circuits having a small amount of gate inputs and operating in single transition time. It is also shown that for a flow table having m1input columns, m input variables, and d stable states, the number of gate inputs required for a single transition time realization is bounded by d(m1+m+1)."
"A sequential machine must have certain redundant information in order to be capable of correcting error. As past inputs and past states are redundant, a sequential machine with error correction capability is constructable by making use of these elements of past information. This paper describes conditions of state assignments, numbers of required redundant state variables, and estimation of reliability of failure-tolerant sequential machines."
"This paper describes a special-purpose character recognition system which uses contextual information for the recognition of words from any given dictionary of words. Previous techniques that utilized context involved letter transition probabilities of digrams and trigrams. This research introduces the concept of binary digrams which overcomes some of the problems of past approaches. They can be used to extract offectively the \"syntax\" of the dictionary while requiring very modest amounts of storage. A computationally feasible procedure is described which allows the accuracy requirements of the character recognizer to be relaxed if it is followed by a contextual postprocessor. The modified recognition system is allowed to output several alternatives for each character, while the postprocessor selects the proper string of characters by having access to both the dictionary and the dictionary syntax. A theoretical estimate of the recognition rate is derived, and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the system to achieve low error and rejection rates."
"The expenditure of resources to provide via software more structure and more function in conventional machines has become excessive. The answer to this problem may consist in providing more structure and more function in hardware. With respect to structure, we describe 1) the binary tree as basic data and control structure, 2) the implementation of a binary tree by a conventional memory, and 3) the associated hardware. The most important enhancement with respect to function, the newly introduced unit of action, deals with the handling of variables and substitution."
"A Boolean function U( z1,...,zm) is universal for given n≥1 and a set I of variables if it realizes all Boolean functions f(x1,..., xn) by substituting for each zj a variable of I. Designs of universal Boolean functions for various specifications of I are considered for the practical cases of n<10. Assuming the number m of input terminals as criterion of simplicity, the designs obtained are the best known to be offered by a systematic procedure for the same specifications."
"An algorithm for generating Hilbert's space-filling curve in a byte-oriented manner is presented. In the context of one application of space-filling curves, the algorithm may be modified so that the results are correct for continua rather than for quantized spaces."
"An asynchronous sequential network is an interconnection of several asynchronous sequential circuits. Asynchronous networks are classified according to the relative time delay of the individual circuit's feedback signals and input signals. They are also classified by the manner in which the circuits interact. In addition, another network model uses duplicate paths for the feedback signals and the input signals of a circuit where the duplicate paths have differing delays. The partition theory of Hartmanis and Stearns [5] is used for characterizing some of the network types in a manner analogous to the characterization of synchronous sequential networks. The special case where each circuit in the network has only two states is equivalent to specifying a state assignment for the overall network and this leads to a characterization of some state assignments for asynchronous circuits. In particular, any arbitrary state assignment for the network which has duplicate paths and delays is shown to be free of critical races, and another network model leads to a variation of the minimum transition-time state assignments which in certain cases may require fewer state variables."
"Traditionally, synchronous sequential circuits are considered controlled by input pulses, and asynchronous sequential circuits by input levels. The aim of this note is to study the general properties of a class of asynchronous circuits with some inputs that can be thought of as driven by \"pulses.\" The synthesis process and the internal structure of these circuits, called pulse input asynchronous sequential circuits (PA circuits), are investigated, and they are compared with pulse input synchronous circuits and with level input asynchronous circuits. Procedures are described to transform any flow table describing a synchronous circuit into a flow table describing an equivalent PA circuit, and to realize any normal mode asynchronous circuit by a PA circuit. Specific techniques for PA circuit state reduction and PA circuit state assignment are described in other papers."
"A high-speed array multiplier generating the full 34-bit product of two 17-bit signed (2's complement) numbers in 40 ns is described. The multiplier uses a special 2-bit gated adder circuit with anticipated carry. Negative numbers are handled by considering their highest order bit as negative, all other bits as positive, and adding negative partial products directly through appropriate circuits. The propagation of sum and carry signals is such that sum delays do not significantly contribute to the overall multiplier delay."
"Probabilistic automata with time-variant final state sets monitored, in an intuitive manner, by autonomous probabilistic automata are considered. It is shown that they include a scheme suggested by Turakainen as a particular case, and that they accept all the stochastic languages. If the monitors are started in stationary distributions, it is proved that such schemes will accept all and only the stochastic languages; other cases in which the languages can be shown to be stochastic follow, including the case in which the state transition matrix of the monitor is deterministic."
"General one-parameter solutions are exhibited for the RS, RST, and JK flip-flop input equations."
"Paull and Unger [1] were the first to develop methods for solving the problem of minimizing the number of internal states of incompletely specified sequential machines. Grasselli and Luccio [2] improved upon these methods by introducing rules for reducing the size of the problem and by transforming the problem into a linear integer programming problem. House and Stevens [3] have provided a means of further reducing the size of the problem by developing an additional rule."
"An r-ary shift-register sequence is desired that has arbitrary cycle length L≤rkfor arbitrary r and k, where k is the number of stages (degree) of the shift register. The existence of such sequences is established for \"almost all\" cycle lengths L. Furthermore, existence of such sequences which are \"zero free\" for almost all cycle lengths L is proved."
"Using as logic modules two-input one-output arbitrary logic gates, this note considers the problem of the longest chain (number of levels) in a tree-type interconnection realizing a Boolean function of n variables. Specifically, we are interested in the minimum number of levels L(n) by which we can constructively realize all Boolean functions of n variables. It was previously shown that L(n)≤n for n=3, 4 and it was so conjectured for n= 5; in this note we are able to show that this holds for n=5, 6, 7, 8."
"Complete monotonicity is a necessary condition for linear separability of a switching function and it is equivalent to the 2-asummable property. A test for this property using a tabular representation of a switching function and an easily generated test card is given. This method may be used reasonably well up to six variables."

"A known bound on the maximum size of a subset of the binary n-cube with distance k is applied to yield an asymptotically good bound on the length of a circuit or chain in the n-cube of spread k."
"This correspondence presents an example of a two-way automaton which has significantly fewer states than any one-way automaton accepting the same set of tapes. Thus, in this particular case, memory space can be saved by using a two-way automaton. This savings in space, however, is accompanied by an increase in recognition time."
"This correspondence shows that the Necula [1] and Slagle, Chang. and Lee [2] methods for determining prime implicants are a mechanization of a method first given by Nelson [3], i. e., generating of all prime implicants by direct expansion of a conjunctive form to a disjunctive form."
"Minimum feedback realizations of synchronous sequential machines using set-reset flip-flops are discussed. The known results are pointed out in order to clarify any possible misunderstanding of a statement made in a recent review."
"In the above article1Rhyne describes a technique for serial binary to BCD (and BCD to binary) conversion using a single clock pulse per bit, as opposed to the two clock per bit method described earlier by Couleur [1]. Although Rhyne may be correct that his method has not been published in the official \"scientific engineering\" literature, it turns out that this same method has been published several times previously in the \"trade\" literature [2], [3]. One difference is that previous articles have implemented the technique with \"D\" flip-flops, as opposed to the \"J-K\" flip-flops used in the Rhyne article."

"This paper considers the problem of designing an n-input, n-output, asynchronous unit delay (AUD) [2], [7], [13]. In the general case, all input changes are allowed in an AUD. However, the restricted case where only single input changes are allowed has been investigated in detail. Starting with linear single error-correcting codes, an unusual method of obtaining a uniquely reduced flow table of a restricted AUD is developed. Such a reduced table has 2k substitution property (SP) partitions [15] on the set of internal states whose product is the zero partition, where k is the smallest integer equal to or greater than log2 n. Hence, the state behavior of an n-input n-output restricted AUD is realizable by 2k two-state sequential circuits connected in parallel [15]. A direct algorithm for obtaining this realization is also given."
"This paper presents an alternate approach to the problem of delayed-input circuit realization of any fundamental mode asynchronous flow table. This approach is based on partition theory. It is shown that an equivalent normal primitive flow table of any reduced flow table has n binary partitions with substitutioh property such that their product is a 2nblock partition with substitution property, where n is the number of binary inputs. Such a property leads directly to a circuit which realizes the flow table and is a serial connection of two smaller subcircuits. The first subcircuit is again decomposable into n smaller circuits connected in parallel. It is shown that these n circuits always correspond to trivial delays in the input lines, thus leading to the delayed-input circuit realization of the fundamental mode flow table."
"A batch-fabricated three-dimensional coaxial microelectronic interconnection and packaging technique has been developed that is particularly suited to semiconductor chips of all complexities, ranging from single-junction devices to large-scale integrated circuit devices. The interconnections are coaxial in three dimensions, are formed by electrochemically sculpturing copper planes, and are assembled by pressure-stacking the planes to combinatorially interconnect, mount, and remove heat from high-density semiconductor systems. Although initially developed for high-speed digital systems, the technique is generally universally applicable to other disciplines, such as microwave circuits and structures. Circuit and semiconductor chip package densities can be achieved which offer one to three orders of magnitude increased density over conventional packaging systems. The technique is believed the closest to a truly three-dimensional interconnect medium yet achieved that can be nondestructively disassembled for repair, that has the thermal management capabilities required for high-density systems, and that is free of interconnection crosstalk."
"One of the most perplexing problems confronting device designers utilizing MOS technology is the development of an effective layout design methodology. This paper describes a versatile layout design scheme for customized digital-type MOS arrays utilizing four-phase clocking schemes (ratioless logic). The analytical characterization of this layout design scheme is defined through the introduction of p-order and m-order indices. The p-order indices are assigned to members of the Boolean equation set that define the relative placement of their mechanization areas (p-diffusion structures) on the MOS array. The m-order indices are assigned to members of the term set that define their relative placements within parallel metalization channels on the MOS array. The underlying variables influencing the algorithmic derivation of quasi-optimal p-order and m-order assignments are also discussed."
"Kautz has studied the problem of testing one-and two-dimensional arrays of combinational cells under the assumptions that all cell inputs must be applied to a cell to test it completely and that a fault in a cell may cause any arbitrary change in its outputs. In this paper we study the same problem under a more restricted set of assumptions: 1) all faults in a cell can be detected by a known set of inputs (usually smaller than the set of all inputs); and 2) each fault will affect the cell outputs in a known manner. Necessary and sufficient conditions for detection of faults in one-dimensional arrays are obtained. A procedure for deriving efficient tests for one-dimensional arrays is presented. Sufficient conditions for the testability of two-dimensional arrays and procedures for constructing tests for some arrays are obtained."
"The analysis and synthesis of the fail-safe logical systems have been studied by many authors. They utilize logical elements with asymmetric failure. It is shown that by duplicating two identical systems in parallel it is possible to raise the reliability of the system considerably. If, for example, 0 is the safe value, the duplicate output (0, 1) or (1, 0) is regarded as 1. The output (0, 0) is regarded as 0, which cannot, however, be judged to be correct or to be incorrect."
"This paper describes two sets of algorithms in positive radix arithmetic for conversions between positive and negative integral radix representation of numbers. Each set consists of algorithms for conversions in either direction; these algorithms are mutually complementary in the sense they involve inverse operations depending upon the direction of conversion. The first set of algorithms for conversion of numbers from positive to negative radix (negative to positive radix) proceeds serially from the least significant end of the number and involves complementation and addition (subtraction) of unity on single-digit numbers. The second set of algorithms for conversion of numbers from positive to negative radix (negative to positive radix) proceeds in parallel starting from the full number (the most significant end of the number) and involves complementation and right (left) shift operations. The applications of these algorithms to integers, mixed integer-fractions, floating-point numbers, and for real-time conversions are given."
"Aspects of topology and geometry are used in analyzing continuous and discrete binary images in two dimensions. Several numerical properties of these images are derived which are \" locally countable.\" These include the metric properties area and perimeter, and the topological invariant, Euler number. \"Differentials\" are defined for these properties, and algorithms are given. The Euler differential enables precise examination of connectivity relations on the square and hexagonal lattices. Easily computable binary image characterizations are introduced, with reference to a serial binary image processor (BIP) now being built. A precise definition of \"localness\" is given, and some implications for image computation theory are examined."
"Simple sets of parallel operations are described which can be used to detect texture edges, \"spots,\" and \"streaks\" in digitized pictures. It is shown that, by comparing the outputs of the operations corresponding to (e.g.,) edges of different sizes, one can construct a composite output in which edges between differently textured regions are detected, and isolated objects are also detected, but the objects composing the textures are ignored. Relationships between this class of picture processing operations and the Gestalt psychologists' laws of pictorial pattern organization are also discussed."
"Recent work, apparently beginning with a paper by Welch in 1966, has shown that character expansions on finite Abelian groups can be fast computed in a way that makes the FFT and FWT special cases. It is shown here how the computational saving depends on the annihilator subgroup of the character group under consideration."
"The efficient production of LSI realizations of Boolean functions is studied and two interconnection procedures are presented. The first procedure is a modular method using planar circuits. The second procedure, which stresses a minimum number of gates, results in an \"all purpose\" chip which can be personalized externally by the customer."
"An algorithm for pattern classification using eigenvectors is presented. This algorithm provides an alternative viewpoint for obtaining a solution weight vector of certain pattern classification problems. Convergence of the algorithm is proved and the termination condition of iteration is given. An interesting point is that this algorithm does not require the inversion of matrices, instead it requires the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix."

"A recently proposed matrix factorization for a Hadamard matrix of order twelve is shown to be invalid in that the factored matrix is not Hadamard."
 "An algorithm for a fast matrix transform of order twelve was given by Pratt [1]. The resulting transform matrix consists of plus and minus ones, is in order of sequency, but is not orthogonal, and hence is not a Hadamard matrix. This note proves it is impossible to construct a Hadamard matrix of order twelve with this increasing sequency property and gives a corrected algorithm of order twelve."
"A method is presented which utilizes the results of the Glassman paper [1] to factor the FFT matrix in terms of Kronecker product expansions [2], [3]. The method clarifies the Glassman results and presents them in an elegant and compact format."
"The possible adoption of the metric system in the United States makes it logical that any other major changes be considered at the same time. Therefore, it is proposed to adopt the octal number system in place of the decimal. The importance of computers in our lives makes it reasonable that we adopt a number system with a base 2n. The advantages and disadvantages of the various values of n are given. The octal (n=3) number system is found to be the best one. The feasibility and some ramifications of octal adoption are presented."

"A procedure for computing shaded pictures of curved surfaces is presented. The surface is approximated by small polygons in order to solve easily the hidden-parts problem, but the shading of each polygon is computed so that discontinuities of shade are eliminated across the surface and a smooth appearance is obtained. In order to achieve speed efficiency, the technique developed by Watkins is used which makes possible a hardware implementation of this algorithm."
"A digital system can be viewed as an interaction of two structures, a data flow structure and a control structure. In this paper we adopt this point of view and concentrate on defining a structure theory for asynchronous control networks, which is formed by interconnecting certain basic control modules. Each control module performs a single primitive control function."
"This paper describes an algorithm for the computation of tests to detect failures in asynchronous sequential logic circuits. It is based upon an extension of the D-algorithm [1]. Discussion of experience with a program of the procedure is given."
"This paper describes the Fortran parallel task recognizer and the directed graph model upon which it is based. The recognizer is itself a Fortran program. As input the recognizer accepts source programs written in Fortran; as output the recognizer generates a set of tables which communicate to the operating system information regarding the parallel processability of source program tasks. The recognizer has been used to analyze several programs in an attempt to determine what characteristics render a program \"suitable\" for parallel processing. Timing studies have shown that the detailed recognizer analysis consumes a large amount of time in an attempt to answer the suitability question. For a suitable production-type program this analysis time can be distributed over the lifetime of the program. In those cases where the source program is not suitable for parallel processing, however, this analysis represents a wasted investment of valuable system resources. To circumvent this, a heuristic procedure has been developed which introduces little overhead and provides a preliminary answer to the suitability question based solely on the nature and number of source program statements. If the preliminary analysis suggests a favorable potential for the source program, then the program is subjected to the detailed analysis of the recognizer."
"Any switching function can always be realized by a single multithreshold threshold element possessing a suitable number of thresholds. However, the practical realization of such elements often presents serious difficulties; as such it becomes more convenient to realize the given function in the form of a network of multi-threshold threshold elements, each possessing fewer thresholds. In this paper, a thorough study of these networks with different modes of interconnection has been made. These discussions have been limited to constant weight (CW) networks only. Finally, a technique for obtaining the three-threshold network configuration for an arbitrary k-threshold function has also been suggested. It has been assumed that feedback loops are absent."
"Computers, in conjunction with microfilm recording equipment, are capable of generating pictures with a reasonable number of gray levels and good resolution. A method is described for producing pictures by means of halftone dot patterns using such equipment. The method is relatively insensitive to variations in hardware performance and adjustments."
"This note presents a new algorithm for computing the cyclic convolution of two vectors over a commutative ring. The algorithm requires n(n1+1)...(nk+1)/2kmultiplications for the convolution of two n-vectors, where n=n1...nkis a factorization of n into factors which are pairwise relatively prime."
"This paper presents a new procedure for constructing nonuniversal shared-row internal state assignments for asynchronous sequential circuits. The method consists basically of establishing an initial code with the minimum number of variables required to distinguish the states. satisfactory assignment is obtained. State variables added in the expansion of an assignment are merely the EXCLUSIVE OR of state variables in the original assignment. This simple construction procedure terminates with a maximum of m+[m/2] state variables for a 2m-row flow table."
"A method of implementing two single-bit adders is discussed. These adders can be used individually to realize the conventional functions of serial addition and serial multiplication on a pair of operands, or they can be cascaded to allow the serial addition of three operands for forming the product of complex numbers. In either case, the circuits will detect the occurrence of an overflow or the generation of the number minus one, and they will allow an addition to be rescaled by outputting the correct bits during the additional shifts, whether the addition overflowed or not."
"An associative memory system using push-down or first-in first-out (FIFO) lists as its basic building elements is described. With the development of large-scale integration technology (LSI), it is expected that devices with regular repetitive structure and high gate/interconnection ratio can be manufactured at extremely low cost. Push-down and FIFO evidently belong to that category. The logic design of a push-down and a FIFO list memory are first described. Then, with some additional control logic, it is shown that they can be converted to an associative memory."
"It is pointed out that in a computer provided with multiple base-limit registers a slave or buffer memory may be used to reduce time spent in address validation and relocation, as well as for its normal purpose of reducing memory access time."
"A general approach to the problem of scaling machine arithmetic is developed. This leads to the determination of inequalities that can serve as a basis for the derivation of systematic scaling techniques. The inequalities and techniques are shown to apply to complement arithmetic with either integral or fractional machine operations and to absolute value and sign arithmetic for both types of operations. A detailed discussion is presented for the case of complement integer arithmetic. The connections with floating point arithmetic are derived."
"Using the formula A · B=[(A+ B)/2]2-[(A-B)/2]2, the binary multiplication problem is reducible to that of decomposing the square of P 0 · P1P2... Pkinto a sum of two or three quantities. For the eight-bit case, a study of the multiplication parallelogram suggests p2= R+ S+ T, where Pl and p8 appear only in R, and P2, P7 appear only in R and S. Each bit in T involves the ORing of no more than four terms, each involving no more than four Boolean variables. For a two-input adder, S and Tare combined into a six-variable problem, each bit may have up to 14 terms. The six-and four-bit problems are degenerate cases with R=0 and R= S=0, respectively."
"The set of transformations which preserve the equivalence classes of figural patterns is considered. The simple figure and its abstract description in a metric space are defined. An appropriate distance is proposed to be applied to pattern recognition."
"It is known that for every integer d there are transition functions not isomorphically realizable by any net having feedback indegree (the largest number of wires that any delay receives from other delays in its feedback loop) less than d. Here we show that, in contrast to the isomorphic case, every transition function can be homomorphically realized by nets of feedback indegree not exceeding 2. This is a least upper bound, since simple nets (i. e., those having feedback indegrees not exceeding 1) are shown not to be universal in this sense."
"Hartmanis and Stearns defined the concept of an inessential error in their study of errors in sequential machines and represented such errors by means of an error partition Π E. Although they showed that ΠE could not be determined using only the usual partition pair algebras, they did not provide a means by which it could be determined. The purpose of this note is to develop an algorithm for the determination of ΠE for a given machine."
"The switching variables in a switching circuit are considered as binary random variables. The input signals are given joint probabilities, from which the output signals' probabilities are known. The joint entropy, or average information content, of subsets of variables is defined, and a proof is given that a set of these entropies are characteristic invariants of the PCN equivalence classes."
"In this paper CEP functions are applied to realize nonlinearly separable switching functions. It is proved that the introduction of these functions may realize all the 22nswitching functions of n binary variables. A model of a nonlinear threshold component is proposed to realize the switching functions."
"In this note, we develop an algorithm to design a two-level switching network composed of negative gates with no fan-in restriction imposed on them. The resulting network is such that it minimizes the cost function h(G, 1), a monotone nondecreasing function of G and I, where G is the total number of gates and I is the total number of interconnections in the network. In other words, the earlier work is generalized so that the number of interconnections may be included in its cost criterion. The algorithm is then extended to the multiple output network design."
"A technique is presented for the generation of any finite set of Walsh functions in both serial and parallel form. It uses a straightforward constructive definition of these functions. In order to simultaneously generate the first 2nfunctions, [(22n-1)/3] storage devices and (2n+2-5) logic gates are required."

"This paper describes the functional characteristics of the Standard Computer MLP-900 processor. This microprogrammable processor is designed for general-purpose emulation of a wide variety of known processors as well as being adaptable to new general-purpose and special-purpose applications. Two approaches to the design of microprogrammed processors, namely minimally encoded and highly encoded, are considered. The significant architectural properties that provide the multilingual capability are discussed. A target language-execution strategy for the MLP-900 is presented followed by a problem-oriented target instruction set which provides for packed field operations. Finally, some projected uses of the processor are considered."
"A frame of reference is established for evaluating the various philosophies or approaches to the microprogramming of control logic. Three new measures for analyzing microprogramming philosophies are introduced: \"monophase\" versus \"polyphase,\" \"parallel\" versus \"serial,\" and \"encode\" versus \"little encode.\" The terms monophase, polyphase refer to how long the microinstruction is valid. Parallel, serial refer to the method used to determine the next instruction to be executed. Encode, little encode refor to the degree of encoding in the microinstruction word. The relative merits of the extremes of these new measures are discussed. Then an example of the use of microprogramming for control logic is explored; specifically Univac's C/SP Processor is microprogrammed. It is then shown that this processor would have a cost and performance comparable with the actual C/SP version now being tested which uses conventional control logic. Moreover, it would have the flexibility and simplicity inherent in microprogramming."
"This paper is an investigation of the organization of a parallel microcomputer designed to emulate a wide variety of sequential and parallel computers. This microcomputer allows tailoring of its control structure so that it is appropriate for the particular computer to be emulated. The control structure of this microcomputer is dynamically modified by changing the organization of its data structure for control. The microcomputer contains six primitive operators that dynamically manipulate and generate a tree-type data structure for control. This data structure for control is used as a syntactic framework within which particular implementations of control concepts, such as iteration, recursion, co-routines, parallelism, interrupts, etc., can be easily expressed. The major features of the control data structure and the primitive operators are: 1) once the fixed control and data linkages among microprocesses have been defined, they need not be rebuilt on subsequent executions of the control structure; 2) microprograms may be written so that they execute independently of the number of physical processors present and still take advantage of available processors; 3) control structures for I/O processes, data-accessing processes, and computational processes are expressed in a single uniform framework. An emulator programmed on this microcomputer works as an iterative two-step process similar to the process of dynamic compilation or run time macroexpansion. This data structure approach to emulation differs considerably from the conventional approach to emulation and provides a unifying approach to the emulation of a wide variety of sequential and parallel computers."
"Functional memory (FM) is a general-purpose systems technology and has been proposed as a solution to the problems of large-scale integration. It is based on an associative array, composed of writable storage cells capable of holding three states; 0, 1, and DON'T CARE. The functional memory module can be used either as a local store, control store, associative store, or logic block. In its use as a logic block, logic is performed by associative table lookup, using the DON'T CARE state to give significant compression of tables over conventional two-state arrays (typically n to n2 words for functional memory instead of 20 words for conventional two-state arrays). The basic properties of functional memory are described in [1]."
"This paper describes a small computer, Interdata Model 3, that has been microprogrammed to serve as an intelligent terminal. The Interdata is connected to a System/360 multiplexor channel with a high-speed interface, and uses an ARDS direct view storage tube as a display console. The new Interdata target machine is patterned after the /360 (including all five instruction formats), but also has instructions particularly designed for intelligent terminal programming. These include instructions for character string manipulation, code conversion, list processing, coordinate manipulation, and virtual addressing. A powerful multiplexor channel, which allows the programmer to \"overlap\" I/O to several devices with a CPU program, has also been microprogrammed."
"With increased use of microprogramming in present computer systems, the need arises to automate the checking and optimization of microcode. This paper reviews the optimization objectives, characterizes microprogranis, and discusses the machine structure. A translator from machine code to microcode appears feasible and is described. Some compiler techniques are reviewed and adapted to improve microprograms by studying operational interaction. Microprogram characteristics permit additional methods to reduce the computation effort. The techniques are integrated into a scheme implemented for optimizing a simulated machine."
"This note describes an emulation of the Burroughs 220 on the IBM 360/25 done at the University of Dayton. The project included the development of an assembler for the 360/25 microlanguage and a simulator/trace program to assist in debugging."
"This report describes the microdiagnostics which were developed for incorporation into the IBM System 360 Model 30 maintenance package. These microdiagnostics enable the System 360 Model 30 to develop internal diagnostics with fault detection and location capabilities, and led to a reduction in the amount of training and service equipment required to adequately service the system."
"This note describes the microdiagnostic approach being used on the Standard Computer MLP-900 processor. This machine is microprogrammable and designed for general-purpose emulation, simulation, and interpretation. As a consequence it has a number of features that make it unusually well suited for the application of microdiagnostics. These include a READ-WRITE control memory, one clock microinstructions, a general-purpose microinstruction repertoire, almost complete microprogram access to the hardware, and the ability to specify test operands as immediate values. These features plus the highly encoded form of microprogramming used greatly facilitate the design and programming of component-oriented test programs. This results in a microdiagnostic which is very compact, has a very short execution time, and requires a relatively short development time. Other advantages include a relatively low hardcore, very thorough testing, and high fault resolution."
"This short note presents the view that microprogramming affords a technology that can provide a powerful, efficient, and versatile computer facility for numerical analysts. Particular areas of application are discussed. Fundamental questions are raised relevant to the exploitation of this technology by numerical analysts."

"A network of passive electrical resistors is connected in a closed loop with a digital computer. This network functions as a parallel-operating subroutine to greatly accelerate the digital computer solution of certain classes of numerical problems. Computer systems employing the analog subroutine concept are \"digital-computer-oriented\" hybrid computers. Problems are programmed for conventional digital computation, and the digital computer flow chart is analyzed to determine if some particularly time-consuming blocks could be better handled by analog rather than digital techniques. A simple special-purpose analog unit is then constructed for this computational task."
"TOPI is a special-purpose computer for the synthesis and analysis of Boolean functions. The algorithms executed by TOPI have been developed specifically for this computer and are an evolution of the iterative consensus method. They allow the determination and classification of the prime implicants of a given Boolean function, as well as the determination of a number of irredundant normal coverings. The computer capabilities are limited to single-output functions of a maximum of 15 variables, or to n-output functions of a maximum of 15-n variables."
"An arbitrary-radix fast Fourier transform algorithm and a design of its implementing signal processing machine are introduced. The algorithm yields an implementation with a level of parallelism proportional to the radix r of factorization of the discrete Fourier transform, allows 100 percent utilization of the arithmetic unit, and yields properly ordered Fourier coefficients without the need for pre- or postordering of data."
"Standard flow table methods for analysis and synthesis of asynchronous sequential switching networks are difficult to apply when edge-sensitive flip-flops are used. Use of a differential mode (DM) state table, which specifies the next state as a function of the present state and input change, avoids such difficulties. Difference operators, which are used to specify changes in logic variables, provide a convenient means for defining terminal behavior of edge-sensitive flip-flops. The inhibited toggle flip-flop is introduced as a general-purpose edge-sensitive flip-flop. Sequential networks are analyzed by writing difference operator equations from which a DM table can be constructed. Synthesis of asynchronous networks is accomplished by first constructing a DM table to describe the desired network and then deriving input equations for inhibited-toggle flips-flops. Such realizations are free of hazards and critical races and usually require fewer gates and flip-flops than solutions by standard flow table methods."
"Methods to realize race-free asynchronous sequential circuits by using appropriate single transition time (STT) state assignments have been described in the literature. This paper deals with that restricted class of asynchronous circuits (called pulse-input asynchronous circuits) for which in every input sequence each input state liis always followed by a special input state lo≠li. A method is presented to realize any pulse-input asynchronous sequential circuit with p internal states by a universal race-free STT state assignment in 2Eovariables, where Eo=[log2n] and n≤p is the number of the elements in a defined subset of internal states."
"Parallel decimal arithmetic capability is becoming increasingly attractive with new applications of computers in a multi-programming environment. The direct production of decimal sums offers a significant improvement in addition over methods requiring decimal correction. These techniques are illustrated in the eight-digit adder which appears in the System/360 Model 195."
"One-and two-dimensional iterative arrays of identical cells are becoming more important in the design of digital systems using large-scale integrated circuits because of the advantages that they provide in design, fabrication, and testing. Since arrays containing hundreds or thousands of gates on one chip are now considered possible, the task of finding procedures for the testing of such arrays from their edges is of concern to both the users and the manufactures. The iterative nature of cellular arrays sometimes makes it possible to derive test schedules of reasonable length."
"A remote terminal with graphical output capability has been designed for use with time-shared computer systems. The terminal contains a small computer to provide local picture storage and the ability to employ picture encoding techniques which greatly reduce transmission times. A storage oscilloscope is used to view the output. Terminal cost is currently about $10 000."
"This paper introduces two schemes to correct bit errors caused by defective memory cells in high-speed random-access memory systems. The schemes are addressed to word-organized memories produced by the integrated technologies. One of the two schemes calls for encoding of input information and the other does not. The schemes are simple, economical for the technologies concerned, and exhibit a regularity which makes it possible to fabricate the necessary additional hardware within the same technology."
"Using the convex combination of random binary variables, stochastic vectors and stochastic matrices are systematically realized. The techniques are extended to the realization of stochastic automata as randomly fed deterministic automata."
"Variational equations are derived as a preliminary step in determining efficient digital integration techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems. The variational approach is applied initially to linear time-invariant systems to introduce the basic concept and then to nonlinear time-varying systems. For systems containing both linear and nonlinear parts, a combination technique which uses the exact difference equation for the linear part is developed. Higher order variational equations are also derived and compared on a simple system. Numerical approximations for solving these variational equations are discussed and illustrated for a second-order mildly nonlinear example. A significant improvement in both accuracy and execution time is realized over results obtained by the conventional fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. Finally, the new approach is discussed from the viewpoint of computational experience and special limitations for practical applications."
"This note is concerned with the application of digital computers to solve analytically a class of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Programs, written in the FØRMAC language, are described, which employ the perturbation methods of Krylov, Bogoliubov, and Mitropolsky. Solutions of Duffing's equation and van der Pol's equation are included as examples."
"The method of decomposition offers a means to overcome the computational difficulty associated with unstable two-point boundary value problems. The basic idea is to decompose systematically an unstable differential equation into a sequence of differential equations of a lower order, which are each stable either in the forward or in the backward direction of computer integration."
"An iterative procedure consisting of successive point relaxation of the vector potentials with the use of over-and underrelaxation factors is described for the determination of the three-dimensional flux distribution in the end zone of a high-speed aerospace alternator."
"The properties of a two-dimensional display whose coordinates are the Euclidean distances from two points in a multivariate space are presented. When used in conjunction with three linear normalization procedures, this display is a useful tool in both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. In addition, some geometric structure is preserved by this mapping. Examples using well-known Iris data are presented to demonstrate the display characteristics."
"Logic design problems that have inessential variables as inputs are often encountered. The required logic can be implemented without the use of these inessential variables. Such variables occur most frequently in incompletely specified functions due to the presence of DON'T CARE conditions. A circuit with a minimal number of inputs would simplify many interconnection problems. This note presents a method that treats each inessential variable as a simple disjunctive decomposition. This treatment leads to a method of identifying and removing a maximal set of inessential variables, and the removal results in a minimal input solution."
"The Quine–McCluskey method of minimizing a Boolean function gives all the prime implicants, from which the essential terms are selected by one or more cover tables known as the prime implicant tables. This note describes a tabular method where the essential prime implicants are selected during the process of forming the combination tables, and other essential terms are selected from what have been described in the note as chains of selective prime implicants. Consequently, the need for successive prime implicant tables is eliminated."
"In this note a sequential machine decomposition implied by the fact that this machine possesses a nontrivial periodic representation is discussed. If it is fulfilled, then for the state behavior of such a sequential machine there exists a nontrivial serial decomposition into two machines, where one of them is autonomous. Moreover, if for a sequential machine there exists a reducible periodic representation, then for the state behavior of this sequential machine there exists a nontrivial parallel decomposition into two machines such that one of them is autonomous. These results permit us to discuss the state-splitting problem with the aid of the T-partitionable equivalency."
"The irredundant prime closed sets play an important role in the simplification of an incompletely specified flow table. In this note, an algebraic method for deriving the irredundant prime closed sets corresponding to any given flow table has been presented. It has been shown that the complete set of irredundant prime closed sets is obtained following the procedure suggested."
"The core of a truth function ø consists of those prime implicants of ø which are terms of every disjunctive normal formula equivalent to ø. The notion of core is generalized here: a class of prime implicants of ø is defined, called its \"pseudo core.\" The pseudo core of ø consists of those prime implicants of ø which are terms of every one of a class Γ of normal equivalents of ø, where Γ includes a simplest normal equivalent. The pseudo core may be found easily and rapidly, plays the same role as the core in simplifying a formula, and may exist even in coreless formulas."
"Attention is called to previous research on realization of an arbitrary switching function by a network of threshold gates (or threshold elements) and modulo-2 gates (or parity elements), establishment of greatest lower bounds on the number of gates needed, artifices that lead to further network reduction in special cases, and systematic minimization of the number of modulo-2 gates required."
"It is possible to view the discrete Fourier transform as the result of approximating the Fourier integral by a trapezoidal rule integration formula. In this correspondence the effects of using higher ordered Newton–Cotes integration formulas are examined. It is shown that in computing the spectrum of a bandlimited process, the trapezoidal rule is preferred when judged by the criterion of choosing the integration formula which leads to the coarsest sampling of the data."
 "An upper bound on the probability of error for the general pattern recognition problem is obtained as a functional of the pairwise Kolmogorov variational distances. Evaluation of the bound requires knowledge of a priori probabilities and of the class-conditional probability density functions. A tighter bound is obtained for the case of equal a priori probabilities, and a further bound is obtained that is independent of the a priori probabilities."

I found the exposition not unlike that of a cookbook—going from simple recipe to difficult recipe, giving each in detail but avoiding the general to emphasize the specific. When you have finished studying it, you may know all sorts of good recipes but that doesn't necessarily make you a chef."

 "This paper introduces the concepts of capacity and reliability of a linear feature extractor. The relationship between the capacity introduced here and the channel capacity in information theory is discussed in some detail. The reliability is associated with the least favorable distributions and gives us a measure of the effectiveness for the worst possible case. It is of particular importance in pattern recognition problems because we have no control over the distributions of the patterns. It is shown that for the family of probability distributions with covariance matrix S, the most reliable (i.e., minimax) feature extractor is the Karhunan-Loève expansion. The concept of reliability is extended to the two-class pattern recognition problem and is discussed in terms of the Bhattacharyya distance."
"First a survey is given of a number of published vowel and word recognition systems. Then a new real-time word recognition system is described that uses only a small computer (8K memory) and a few analog peripherals. The essentials of the procedure are as follows. During the pronunciation of a word, a spectral analysis is carried out by a bank of 17 1/3-octave bandpass filters. The outputs of the filters are logarithmically amplified and the maximal amplitude of the envelope is determined and sampled every 15 ms. In this way a word is characterized by a sequence of sample points in a 17-dimensional space. Then a principal components analysis is performed, reducing the original 17 dimensions of the space to 3. After a linear time normalization, the 3-dimensional trace of the spoken word is compared with 20 reference traces, representing the 20 possible utterances (the digits, plus 10 computer commands). The machine responds by naming the best fitting trace. With the 20 speakers of the design set, the machine is correct 98.8 percent of the time."
"The problem of identifying people based solely upon samples of their speech is viewed as a statistical pattern classification problem, emphasizing the portion of the process in which an informative, concise set of features is extracted from the speech signal. This work takes into account both the limited amount of data available in a real application and the statistical dependence among the various proposed features. In addition, the results of feature evaluation should apply to speakers not involved in the evaluation set."
"DAPR is a digital automatic pattern recognition system, designed to find and measure events in bubble chamber film without manual intervention. It is able to measure film which has come directly from the photographic development process, and to produce on magnetic tape a digital abstraction of the information contained in the film, from which a subsequent selection of desired events takes place by means of a digital scanning process."
"In this paper we present some new ideas on pattern recognition of bubble chamber photographs. We have found global transformations that reduce circular tracks to a point in a two-dimensional angle-curvature space. The performance of this tracking method on a sample of bubble chamber events is presented and planned improvements are discussed."
"POLLY is a special-purpose bubble chamber film-measuring device in which small regions of the film are scanned automatically, the regions being under computer control. With some help from manual interaction facilities incorporated in the device, certain patterns of interest in high-energy physics are detected, identified, and located."
"Golay hexagonal pattern transforms are position independent local operators for use in transforming or altering binary images. The hexagonal tessellation is preferred because it removes the connectivity ambiguity present in the square or checkerboard tessellation. Golay transforms also may be applied to multilevel or \"gray\" images by encoding such images as a registered stack of binary image planes. The general Golay transform creates a new binary image (the output image) from as many as three stacked input images. Simpler Golay transforms merely alter the binary pattern contained in a single image plane, i.e., the same plane acts as both input and output. Because it is slow and cumbersome to perform Golay transforms using a general-purpose computer, fast special-purpose computers have been built for this purpose which may be programmed in a new image processing language called Glol (Golay logic language). It has been found, using both synthetic images as well as images taken from the real world, that Golay transforms are useful in feature enhancement and extraction. Several illustrative examples are provided."
"Experimental pattern recognition techniques for processing chromosome slides with a computer are described. The purpose of the computer program is twofold: to illuminate the basic mechanisms by which a human recognizes an object, such as a chromosome, and distinguishes it from other entities; and the employment of these mechanisms is an automatic and precise extraction of chromosome features."
"The only guaranteed technique for choosing the best subset of N properties from a set of M is to try all (MN) possible combinations. This is computationally impractical for sets of even moderate size, so heuristic techniques are required. This paper presents seven techniques for choosing good subsets of properties and compares their performance on a nine-class vectorcardiogram classification problem."
"Feature extraction is one of the more difficult steps in image pattern recognition. Some sources of difficulty are the presence of irrelevant information and the relativity of a feature set to a particular application. Several preprocessing techniques for enhancing selected features and removing irrelevant data are described and compared. The techniques include gray level distribution linearization, digital spatial filtering, contrast enhancement, and image subtraction. Also, several feature extraction techniques are illustrated. The techniques are divided into spatial and Fourier domain operations. The spatial domain operations of directional signatures and contour tracing are first described. Then, the Fourier domain techniques of frequency signatures and template matching are illustrated. Finally, a practical image pattern recognition problem is solved using some of the described techniques."
"An important aspect in mathematical pattern recognition is the usually noninvertible transformation from the pattern space to a reduced dimensionality feature space that allows a classification process to be implemented on a reasonable number of features. Such feature-selecting transformations range from simple coordinate stretching and shrinking to highly complex nonlinear extraction algorithms. A class of feature-selection transformations to which this note addresses itself is that given by multidimensional rotations. Unitary transformations of particular interest are the Karhunen-Loeve, Fourier, Hadamard or Walsh, and the Haar transforms. A character recognition experiment is selected for exemplary purposes and the use of features in the rotated spaces results in effective minimum distance classification."
"Given two random variables X and Y, a definition is offered that gives a condition for Y to be redundant with respect to X. It is shown that if such redundancy exists, then observations on Y, i.e., pattern vector elements related to Y, can be eliminated without increasing the classification error. A test for redundancy is developed and applied to the problem of preprocessing pattern vectors to eliminate redundant vector elements."
"The distance measures and the information functions for feature selection are compared. The comparison is based on the available tight upper and lower bounds of the probability of misrecognition, the rates of change of such probability, the effectiveness of a feature subset, and the computational complexity."
"This study examines the feasibility and limitations of speaker adaptation in improving the performance of a fixed (speaker-independent) automatic speech recognition system. A fixed vocabulary of 55 [ƏCVd] syllables is used in the recognition system, where C is 1 of 11 stops and fricatives, and V is 1 of 5 tense vowels. The results of the experiment on speaker adaptation, performed with 6 male and 6 female adult speakers, show that speakers can learn to change their articulations to appreciably improve recognition scores. The preliminary results obtained also indicate that most of the necessary adaptation can be achieved in a relatively short time, provided that the speakers are instructed in how to change their articulations to produce the desired effects."
"A feature extraction technique for the next generation of optical character readers must be able to rapidly generate a quantity of discriminant functions using a minimum of equipment. The procedure described in this note generates a series of reference patterns for two-class discrimination and a feature ordering tree which may also be used to decode the sample class. Special hardware is used to provide practical learning times for handprinted characters."
"A simple yet powerful technique for selecting features to be used in a pattern recognition system has been devised and applied to an eight-class character recognition problem using a set of 19 000 typed character samples as a data base. High-order joint probabilities have been directly estimated from the data base, thus making it possible to take into account in the feature selection process the existence of statistical dependencies among features to a greater extent than has been done in previously reported work."
"A project to develop an effective tool for the interactive design of optical character recognition systems is described. The initial design system and several techniques and experiments to improve the system are also reported. Results of an experiment to design a recognition system for typewritten characters are included. The recognition logic required 11.3 man-hours to design and recognized over 99.9 percent of its test characters. It is also small and can run at high speeds on standard digital computer systems. The results of several experiments and recommendations for future experiments to extend these results to hand-printed characters are also included. The development of more powerful multilevel logic forms and suggestions for making these forms easy to use in an interactive design environment are particularly important results of these studies."
"Electrical activity associated with excitation and recovery of heart muscle is manifest as a time-varying potential distribution on the surface of the body. The surface electrocardiogram may be represented by a multipole expansion. The multipole terms can be derived from the surface potentials, and in turn are related to the cardiac sources. Studies indicate that a substantial portion of the information is contained in the dipole plus quadrupole terms of the multipole expansion. An investigation of one normal subject has revealed that surface isopotential maps reconstructed from the dipole-quadrupole are similar to maps constructed from recordings at several hundred electrodes. Preliminary results indicate that accurate dipole and quadrupole components may be obtained from a lead system utilizing as few as 17 electrodes. A theory for possible refinement of the lead system to correct for body size is presented."
"The results of a study undertaken to determine the feasibility of automatic interpretation of ship photographs using the spatial moments of the image as features to characterize the image are reported. The photo interpretation consisted of estimating the location, orientation, dimensions, and heading of the ship. The study used simulated ship images in which the outline of the ship was randomly filled with black and white cells to give a low-resolution high-contrast image of the ship such as might be obtained by a high-resolution radar. The estimates were made using polynomials of invariant moments formed by transformations of the original spatial moments, e. g., density-invariant moments, central moments, rotation-invariant moments, etc. The transformations to invariant moments were chosen using physical reasoning. The best moments for the polynomials were chosen using linear regression. The performance of the method of moments on these low-resolution images was found to be comparable to that of a human photointerpreter and to certain heuristic techniques that would be more difficult to implement than the method of moments."
"Signature analysis of small, complex, cyclic mechanisms is discussed. An envelope preprocessor for isolating signal events relating to mechanical impacts is developed. A recognition system based on second-order (normal) statistics is used and the use of statistical procedures for signature intepretation is presented. Experimental evidence is presented to support the validity of this approach to mechanical diagnostics signature analysis."
"A direct method of measurement selection is proposed to determine the best subset of d measurements out of a set of D total measurements. The measurement subset evaluation procedure directly employs a nonparametric estimate of the probability of error given a finite design sample set. A suboptimum measurement subset search procedure is employed to reduce the number of subsets to be evaluated. Teh primary advantage of the approach is the direct but nonparametric evaluation of measurement subsets, for the M class problem."
"Two techniques are described for efficient encoding of features in pattern recognition. It is shown that the number of binary digits needed to represent patterns can be greatly reduced using efficient feature encoding. Four-thousand utterances based on a 40-word vocabulary are used to evaluate the techniques."
"Features which are linearly dependent on other features do not contribute toward pattern classification by linear techniques. In order to detect the linearly dependent features, a measure of linear dependence is proposed. This measure is used as an aid in feature selection. Speaker verification experiments demonstrate the usefulness of employing such a measure in practice."
"Vectorcardiography is an important area of human and machine pattern recognition. The wide range of interclass variation in observed VCGs is attributed to variations in body structure. Intra-class differences can be minimized and interclass differences maximized if a linear normalization procedure is used to eliminate variations due to individual body differences."
"A computer program has been written to separate overlapping convex blobs present in a binary input picture. The procedure is based on the detection of a feature, concavity, which occurs on the intersecting contours of the overlapping blobs. In order to obtain splitting, paths are grown from these regions of concavity toward the interior until segmentation is achieved. Flow charts of the program and an example are included."
"A feature selection criterion is proposed which is a hybrid of a generalized interset and intraset distance. The problem considered is that of selecting the G best wavebands from a set of H possible wavebands (G<H). The selected wavebands can then be used as inputs to a small computer for decision processing."

"Many common thermal processes (boilers, vats, furnaces, ovens, plasma torches, fluidized beds, etc.) used in industry can be represented by a model comprising an open loop gain μ, a salient time constant T, and a transit delay L. When such processes are to be closed-loop controlled, the question of stability arises. This paper introduces a time-domain normalization and a compound parameter v which incorporates μ, L, and T. By use of displays in another plane, the w plane, stability criteria and transient response can be readily determined for almost all combinations of command and disturbance likely to be encountered in industrial operations. The basic principle of this approach is explained, typical graphical displays are presented and the approach demonstrated by examples. The presentation is intended for the professional engineer concerned with the design and control of processes in industry."
"The adaptive response of peak-holding control systems is investigated using Liapunov's second stability method. The control loop is simplified by neglecting the dynamic elements associated with performance index measurement and a Liapunov function based on the plant and controller nonlinearities is derived. Stability criteria are obtained for the situation where control parameter bounds exist and for two different cases of variation of plant operating conditions (viz., drift and periodic disturbance of optimum operating point). Expeximental results are given that indicate the validity of the technique used, even in situations where the dynamic measurement elements present in the control loop cannot be neglected. The aim of the paper is to improve the understanding of the performance of peak-holding control systems, of the optimalizing type under time varying operating conditions and to present simple stability criteria that are directly applicable to the practical case."
"An automatic device for plotting the equipotential contours of two-dimensional fields, that utilizes an analog hybrid computer in conjunction with two x-y recorders has been developed. It eliminates the need for multielement probes which were used by earlier workers in this field including P. E. Green, J. K. Mickelsen, and D. H. Andrews. The main advantage of the new method is that multivalued fields in both x and y directions can be plotted using only a single element probe."
 "Signal perturbation theory has been shown to reduce the quantization errors in a certain type of position and velocity detection system ( see E. S. McVey and P. F. Chen in IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron. Contr. Instrum., vol. IECI-16, July 1969, pp. 96-98). It is shown in this paper than even better results are obtained when a different set of element weights is used in the system."

"The time optimal control of higher order systems based on available mathematical theories requires tedious mathematical manipulations to determine the switching instants for optimum performance. Even for the third-order system the computations are involved and become intricate if the parameters vary during the system performance. A simple digital technique is presented for time optimal control of third-order systems and takes into consideration any change in system parameters. Sections of actual system trajectories are stored in the computer memory in the form of tables, and projections of optimum switching curves are generated by effectively shifting these stored trajectories to pass through the origin. By continually updating its own optimum trajectories the system has sufficient intelligence to discern proper switching instants in case of any parameter changes without any mathematical calculations. A simple method is proposed to avoid any measurements of derivatives of error. Simulation results are presented to establish the usefulness of of the control technique."
"A fuse of a larger I2t has been found to protect an SCR better than a fuse of a smaller I2t when its I2t was smaller. A mathematical formulation of universal surge rating of rectifiers and peak one-cycle surge current data of SCRs is given to justify the I3t concept."
"A high-speed pulsewidth-modulated exciter with several novel features is described. Although this device has been developed specifically as an exciter for small alternators and to perform a particularly onerous time-constant modification task, it can nevertheless be regarded as a general-purpose medium power amplifier."
 "Industrial application of infrared techniques to monitor the electrolytic processing of copper in refineries located in Europe is described. The recent implementation of this approach allows us to detect incipient electrical shorts in the refinery tanks, thus making it possible to achieve substantial savings in electrical power, time, and product yield."
"There are millions of dollars worth of optical surveillance equipment in use, nearly all of it useless after dark. To provide greater security in the dusk to dawn period, a number of infrared surveillance devices have been developed. A variety of techniques are now being employed, including pulsed and continuous-wave beams in both the direct and backscatter detection modes. The unique advantages of infrared technology relative to ultrasonics and microwaves will determine future trends in the area of surveillance and crime deterrence."
"A description is given of novel applications of infrared inspection which include evaluation of multilayer electronic printed circuit boards, armor plate, automobile tires, aircraft structures, thermal insulation of residential buildings, and others."
"A novel approach capable of solving the problem of tight temperature control of the semiconductor bonding operation in the thermocompression die-attach process is described. The main feature of this new approach is the noncontact measurement of the chip's temperature by means of an infrared detector. A single optical fiber, transparent to infrared radiation, is used as the optical system that enables the detector to view the chip while it is held at the tip of the collet. Figures related to the reduction of rejects in the production of ICs are presented, along with other considerations related to time and money savings that can be achieved in this way."
"Recent developments of infrared detecting systems have made it possible to make use of the large amount of information contained in the infrared radiation emitted by physical objects. The applications presented have in comrnon the characteristic that the information yielded by infrared is either difficult or impossible to obtain with conventional means."
"The introduction of numerous ``mini'' computers in the past few years has been at a pace exceeding the normal assimilation rate of the most knowledgeable engineer. A few nonaccounting applications have proved the importance of the low-cost high-reliability computer in ``process control.'' These existing applications already attest to their salutary effect on productivity, product quality, and cost."
"The cost-performance characteristics of minicomputers and peripheral equipment from the systems engineer's point of view are reviewed. The minicomputer review covers essential differences in memory unit, CPU, I/O structure, and software for the wide variety of machines on the market. The peripheral review covers cost-performance for various I/O devices and emphasizes that peripheral costs may greatly exceed the basic minicomputer costs."
"This discussion of ``Minicomputers and Peripheral Equipment—A Current Review'' was prepared for the panel presentation and discussion held at WESCON in August 1970."
"The use of a minicomputer in process controls has an interesting impact on the sensor and interface selection. For a given system accuracy, the combination of less accurate sensors and a minicomputer connecting program may achieve lower control cost. Linearization, elimination of ``backlash,'' rate of change correction, and on-line calibration are all possible. In addition, the computer can provide mathematical operations on the sensor output and, by modeling, effectively change sensor location. The simplicity of changing programs offers a great deal of flexibility to change the type of control or sensing."
"The inexpensive minicomputer can make the design and development of sensors simpler and less costly. Its processing of a signal improves the basic communication between man and the machine and thus enhances the effectiveness of the sensor."
"The essential characteristics of a minicomputer system designed to control a batch-process chemical plant are presented. The installed hardware and software concepts are presented. The system incorporates direct digital control (DDC) of analog process variables with its real-time software."
"As experience is gained with minicomputer applications, improvements in both hardware and software are made. As might be expected, minicomputers do not ``impersonate'' larger computers well. They are best applied within the framework envisioned by their designer. Each is different. All must be studied to insure the correct selection for a given task."

"The concept of ``fail-safe'' is different from that of``failure minimization.'' It assumes a specific responsibility in a logic system by being required to guarantee the safety of human lives—for instance, in a railway traffic control system."
"Nonconventional applications of a microwave multifrequency CW radar for contactless and continuous monitoring of liquid surface levels are discussed. Analytical and experimental analysis utilizing the multiple-frequency technique to eliminate ambiguous distance measurements are presented. The method makes use of a waveguide partially immersed in the liquid and allows the measurement of phase differences between the outgoing and reflected waves, which is then utilized to determine the liquid level. Potential applications of the proposed method are the monitoring of water levels in piezometers and other liquids in large storage tanks."
"Algorithms for the numerical calculation of currents in rectifier bridges are presented. The cases dealt with are those of an R-L and R-L-C load with single-phase ac supply, and an R-L-E load with a three-phase supply. The algorithms are presented in such a form as to be easily programmed. The calculation of the currents should be useful in design since simple extensions of the programs would supply the harmonics, heat factors, and the rectified or ac currents."
"Techniques have been developed for use in supplying several induction heating loads from a common 3000-Hz power source and for controlling power delivered to each load without excessive interaction. These techniques include the use of saturable reactors for control of delivered power, with capacitance placed across the line before the reactors and a limitation made on the rate of change of delivered power. In addition, fast-response voltage regulation of the output bus, after the load-matching transformer, is used along with physical isolation of power components after the voltage-regulated bus."
"The production of common pulse triggering for a three-phase SCR bridge, which features a control circuit that derives its synchronization and power from the ripple potential of a three-phase half-wave rectifier, is the subject of this paper. The ripple potential is separated from the average dc by clamping and after clipping is utilized as bias for a pulse forming UJT circuit. After firing the UJT is made to conduct for the balance of the bias waveform in order to prevent further pulses from forming and being applied to the SCRs through the pulse transformers. The threephase half-wave rectifier is conveniently in parallel across the delta-wye transformer bank that powers the output load. This design provides 25 to 100 percent control over the conduction angle."
"When the law of conservation of energy is applied to a solenoid actuated stepping motor, it becomes possible to derive an expression for the maximum stepping rate and to explain the phenomenon of skipping. If a sinusoidal electric input and a simple harmonic motion for the plunger are assumed as a mathematical model, the phenomenon of overspin can be explained as a consequence of resonance between the electric input and the plunger motion."
"Twisted, shielded pair cables are commonly used to carry instrumentation and control signals. Manufacturing variations can result in one of the wires of such a pair having a capacitance to the shield which is significantly different than that of the second wire. The charging of these unbalanced capacitances to a common mode voltage results in a transient error voltage on the signal pair."

"The use of flight tables and the present state of the art are described and the specifications for the flight table are derived. Major stress is laid on building a relatively cheap model, that will, nevertheless, satisfy the present requirements. A detailed description of the various alternatives that exist when deciding upon the major components is given along with a discussion on the linear design of the servo loops and stability validations for the expected nonlinearities. A grapho-analytical jump prediction is presented and the wiper backlash problem is analyzed."
"Available methods for synchro to digital conversion which depend on limiting the synchro shaft rotation angle to ± (π/2) are usually complex. In the approach given the synchro shaft is allowed to turn as many times as needed for the required resolution. A pulse counting approach similar to that of the incremental encoder is used for position determination. The control logic that switches the counter from forward to backward counting is the most important part of the block since it should have the ability to block erroneous pulses resulting from hesitating motion within a shaft revolution. The resulting system is simple and inexpensive and has many applications in digital automation."
"An equivalent circuit and computer solution were formulated for describing the output of a metal-sheathed bifilar thermocouple degraded by insulator shunting at high temperatures. This steady-state equivalent circuit model can be used for prediction of errors in thermocouple calibrations, for examining the effects of changes in thermocouple configuration or materials properties, and for examining methods for interrogation or surveillance of the shunting thermocouples."
"The advent of numerically controlled point-to-point industrial equipment has provided a suitable set of conditions for input attenuation functions to improve the performance of linear servomechanisms. The replacement of a random input by a programmed sequence of events allows the output to have essentially dead beat transient response. The elimination of overshoot and a substantial reduction of settling time, allows a numerical instruction to be completed in less time than normally required. The additional control circuitry is simple, inexpensive, and should not impair the reliability."
"A method of evaluating the transient electrical response of a solion diode when excited by different current stimuli is given. This method is extended to obtain the transient response of the solion when connected in a circuit. To illustrate the utility of this method a circuit incorporating a solion diode has been analyzed."

"This document is concerned with reporting the state of the art of measuring impedance in distributed parameter coaxial waveguide systems, propagating a TEM wave. Coaxial lines can be used from direct current to above 40 gigahertz, but are widely utilized beginning with the audio frequencies up through 18 gigahertz. Considered are available accuracies from 50 megahertz to 16 gigahertz, general principles of measurement techniques, basic precautions, and references to pertinent literature. It is one of a series of such reports prepared under a program being carried out by the IEEE. The data in this Report have been assembled by a special task group working in the field of radio-frequency impedance measurements. The data have been organized into tables according to levels or echelons of accuracy ranging from that of the national standard to that of the instruments used by the consumer.<<ETX>>"
"The purpose of this Standard is to make possible the comparison of the relative merits of magnetostrictive, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostrictive transducers on a simple and straightforward basis. The nomenclature used has evolved from a proposed set of definitions for the parameters used in evaluating magnetostrictive materials. In the literature, the symbol ' lambda ' has been widely used for the magnetostriction constant, the saturation magnetostrictive strain, or occasionally, the slope of some other curve associated with magnetostrictive measurement. No quantity is represented by ' lambda ' in this standard.<>"

"Studies to determine the ranging accuracy of the laser systems at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have employed both long-arc orbital comparison, using optical and Doppler observations of Geos-I, and predicted trajectory comparison. The long-arc technique compares the ranges measured by the laser with those predicted by a reference orbit computed without using laser data. The second method, utilizing computed trajectory comparisons, adds laser measurements to an orbital solution to demonstrate the improvement from these data in predicting the position of a spacecraft. The pulsed-laser systems have a range accuracy of approximately 2 m, and the range noise is generally less than 1.5 m when measuring at near-earth satellite distances (1000-3500 km). Early results from laser ranging in daylight show range measurements with no appreciable increase in noise over nighttime operations."
"A two-dimensional, or planar, digital filter can be described in terms of its planar response function, which is in the form of a matrix of weighting coefficients, or filter array. In many instances the dimensions of these matrices are so large that their implementation as ordinary planar convolutional filters becomes computationally inefficient. It is possible to expand the given coefficient matrix into a finite and convergent sum of matrix-valued stages. Each stage can be separated with no error into the product of an m-length column vector multiplied into an n-length row vector, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns of the original filter array. Substantial savings in computer storage and speed result if the given filter array can be represented with a tolerably small error by the first few stages of the expansion. Since each constituent stage consists of two vector-valued factors, further computational economies accrue if the one-dimensional sequences described by these vectors are in turn approximated by one-dimensional recursive filters. Two geophysical examples have been selected to illustrate how the present design techniques may be reduced to practice."
"A linear system approach is presented for the modeling of a stationary layered medium assuming representation by a finite number of thin layers and wave propagation normal to these layers. A linear recursive mathematical model is developed and a method for the identification of parameters is discussed. The results, although specifically derived for the processing of marine seismic data, are applicable to similar type problems in communications and remote sensing."
"The vertical component of ground velocity to which the moving coil seismometer is sensitive undergoes significant filtering before appearing as the input voltage drive for the seismic amplifier. The characteristics of this filter are established by the seismometer parameters, the cable resistance and capacitance, and the input impedance of the amplifier. A solution for both the frequencyand time-domain behavior of this filter has been developed and programmed for a digital computer. The results of applying this network solution to field recording systems serve as a significant guide to the selection of seismometers and their connection pattern, amplifier input system design, and cable constants. Typical and illustrative solutions are given for the amplifier input voltage resulting from an impulse in vertical ground velocity at the seismometer location."
"The design and construction of a radiosonde utilizing solid-state devices and state-of-the-art techniques is discussed. The radiosonde is designed with the idea of obtaining data at a ground station in digital form. Pulse modulation is utilized to transmit the data from the radiosonde. The multiplexer is designed using MOS microtechnology and a prototype is given using discrete MOS integrated circuits. A computer simulation of the actual multiplexer design is performed. The modulator and transmitter are of complete solid-state design. Extensive testing of the overall system indicated satisfactory results and showed a substantial improvement over the present radiosonde. Modification of ground receiving systems to facilitate proper reception of information from the radiosonde is also discussed."
"Radio ground-wave propagation in the Arctic Ocean occurs over mixed paths. The mixed paths include layered or homogeneous sea ice and sea water. Amplitude and phase variations occurring as \"dropoff\" or \"recovery\" effects at the ice-sea-water boundaries provide a technique for sea-ice mapping and an explanation for anomalous radio reception. The phase variations are more sensitive over short distances from the mixed path boundaries. Center for Research in Engineering Science"
"A system for measuring azimuth angle of a target (meteor trail at height of 80 to 110 km) is described. The system is part of a larger system that uses pulsed radar to determine doppler shift, slant range, elevation angle and antenna boresight information for each meteor trail recorded. The angle measuring system uses the technique of radar interferometry (thus depending on phase measurements), which has the advantages that the uncorrelated receiver noise is averaged out, increased angular resolution is obtainable, and calibration of the system is much easier than with systems which depend on amplitude measurements. Data are presented which verify the system operation."
"A theoretical analysis of the radiated fields and their polarization parameters has been made for a horizontal magnetic dipole situated on the surface of a layered half-space. With a view to using the system mounted on a lunar surface vehicle, two transmitter-receiver separations of 3 and 10 m, respectively, have been considered. A number of planar models of the lunar interior have been envisioned with various thicknesses of a debris top layer and with a second layer consisting of dry rock, 1 percent water-bearing wet rock and permafrost, respectively. A study of the results shows that resolution of layers can be achieved to depths of 20 m for these separations. The presence or absence of water in the lunar subsurface, for the materials that might exist in the moon, is clearly indicated by the characteristic signatures obtained over the frequency range of 103 to 107 Hz. The amplitude and phase of the vertical component of the magnetic field and the tilt angle, and the ellipticity of the magnetic polarization ellipse seem to be the most diagnostic parameters."
"A precision constant-current supply designed to deliver up to 600 mA at 18 V dc is described. Short-term stability (<8 h) is within ±0.002 percent of range. Long-term stability (72 h) is ±0.01 percent of range. The system is discussed in relation to its application for the control of magnetic environments using a three-axis Helmholtz coil configuration."
"A sediment velocimeter for use on core samples in the core liner is described. The instrument is clamped around the core liner and measures the transit time of a compressional wave pulse through the liner and enclosed sample. In contrast to other core-sample velocimeters, the diameter of the core liner is determined simultaneously as part of the measurement by a micrometer. The pulse is transmitted through the liner in radial direction without using a coupling liquid. Calibration is obtained by utilizing the known sound velocity of distilled and degassed water. The weight of the instrument is 10 lbs, including electronic equipment and batteries, but exclusive of an oscilloscope, and was designed and fabricated at the Ling-Temco-Vought Research Center, Hawaiian Division, Honolulu, Hawaii. Accuracy of velocity measurements is better than ±1 percent."

 "Vertical-incidence (VI) ionospheric measurements, traditionally performed with 5- to 50-kW ionosondes, may be obtained alternatively using FM CW transmissions of much lower peak power. The FM signal must be interrupted periodically to permit both transmitting and receiving with a single antenna. An ionosonde of this type has been constructed and operated. The monostatic FM sounder radiates a peak power of 8 W and sweeps the frequency range of 0.5 to 30 MHz either linearly or logarithmically. Records from the FM ionosonde are comparable in time delay resolution, S/N, and overall quality to conventional pulse ionograms; the effects of interference from other HF users is somewhat less conspicuous on the FM sounder records. It is suggested that this advantage, plus the benefits of lower power operation, may make possible VI measurements under circumstances where a conventional pulse ionosonde is impractical."
"A marine Vibroseis system is described that provides for a substantial increase in radiated power. The system is computer-controlled for precise sweep generation, compositing of successive sweeps, and formatting of the tape recording. This increase in radiated power with precision signal generation and recording has demonstrated a survey capability of twice the speed of that previously used. The computer control provides for a soft-wired system that permits optional mode changes and offers the means for further automation of positional control with data collection. On-board monitoring with single-channel continuous correlation provides for a continuous profile plot of any one of the 24 recording intervals of the towed hydrophone array. Through use of diagnostic programs, the system is periodically checked, which assists the operator in determining any fault as well as assisting in corrective action. The system provides for a type-out of the operating log."
"The field structure of a buried vertical oscillating magnetic dipole is examined. For an observer on the earth's surface, it is indicated that the finite conductivity of the earth will modify the geometrical character of the vertical and horizontal magnetic field components. However, this effect is quite small if the burial depth is less than an electrical skin depth."
"The signal EMF induced as a function of time in a proton-precession magnetometer sensor of toroidal shape with an elliptical cross-sectional area is calculated in terms of the magnetic properties of the sensor fluid, polarizing current, orientation of the sensor with respect to the direction of the ambient magnetic field, and geometric proportions of the sensor. It is assumed that the sensor is in a uniform ambient magnetic field; the polarizing current is reduced to zero in a time that is short compared to the period of the Larmor precession of the nuclear magnetic moments in the sensor fluid; the nuclear magnetic moments do not interact; and no significant current flows in the sensor winding during the relaxation process in which the EMF is measured. In the specific case that the sensor winding fills the toroid window and that the polarizing supply is a constant voltage source, the calculations permit a simple comparison of variously proportioned sensors in terms of the signal EMF amplitude."
"The use of a single-mode filter for obtaining spectral estimates with an analog computer is discussed. The equivalent bandpass filter that results may have some undesirable selectivity characteristics. Examples are given and suggestions made on ways of avoiding these errors. Some applications of this type of data analysis are given by Jones and Pasquill [1] and Businger et al. [2]."
"Observational data often is irregularly taken or has large gaps due to instrument failure or other real world effects. Yet no spectral estimation theory in use allows one, without dubious interpolation, to estimate spectra from an irregularly sampled signal, nor to combine pieces of record to estimate power at periods longer than the longest piece. A natural extension of conventional complex demodulation is proposed and illustrated for estimating auto- and cross-spectra. The sampling times can be randomly spaced and need not even be in order. The method reduces to the usual method when the data are equally spaced."

 "One of the more promising remote-sensing instruments that will be used in earth-resources survey programs is the multispectral scanner. It will collect both spectral and spatial information on the terrain scanned in a spatially registered manner. This paper describes one such scanner, which is being developed for a NASA C-130 earth-resources survey aircraft. It will be capable of simultaneously viewing 24 wavelength bands in the range between 0.34 and 13 m; it will have a spatial resolution of 2 mrad and an active scan of 80°. The spectral bands are formed by detector arrays in the focal plane of two grating spectrometers. All bands are radiometrically calibrated using field-filling sources that are viewed during the inactive part of the scan cycle. The scanner has been installed and test flown during the latter part of 1970, and will be delivered to NASA in the summer of 1971."
"An examination of remote sensing literature shows that little has been done to apply newer remote sensors to water prospecting. Hydrologic and geothermal principles indicate that heat-sensitive remote sensors like the infrared line scanner and the microwave radiometer have useful potential in arid hydrogeologic studies. An experimental test is described in which results of remote sensing are presented for four arid areas in the western United States: Railroad Valley and the Las Vegas Basin in Nevada, Death Valley in California, and the Hueco Mountains in Texas. In the test the primary remote sensors are the infrared line scanner, 8-14 microns, and a 13.7-GHz microwave radiometer; color and color infrared photography are secondary sensors. The altitude best for hydrogeologic data collection is examined. Results of the study show that infrared color photography is sensitive to changes in plant communities reflecting concentrations of near surface water. Signatures of near-surface water concentration are contained in 8-14 micron infrared and 13.7-GHz microwave radiometer data. This data with hydrologic and geologic extrapolation lead to rapid prospecting of arid regions for indications of groundwater reserves."
"A three-instrument infrared spectral emittance experiment, comprising a rapid-scan spectrometer (6.7-13.3 μm), radiometer (10.375-12.1 μm), and boresight camera, has been flight tested over selected geological terrain in central and southern California and Nevada. Preand post-flight calibrations of the infrared spectrometer were performed both by using polished samples of \"standard\" rocks (quartz diorite and gabbro) as well as the more familiar blackbody radiance standards. From these latter spectra the instrument transfer function (Aτλ) was derived. In-flight calibrations of wavelength were achieved by the rapid insertion and removal of a polystyrene film in the optical train of the spectrometer, as polystyrene is a material whose transmission spectrum is constant and well known. By flying over a body of water (ϵ6.7-13.3μm = 0.98) and recording the radiance spectrum of that target one can determine the transmission spectrum of the atmospheric path between the aircraft and the water (at least to a first approximation) as both the spectral emittance of lake water and the optical transfer functions of the instrument are known or can be calculated. So far, flights have been made only at low altitudes (2000 ft above the lake), with the lake surface at 2000 ft (near Pisgah Crater, S. Calif.) or 6000 ft (Mono Lake, E. Calif.) above sea level. The lake should be in the area to be studied geologically."
"An analytical base for assessing the performance of thermal mapping systems suitable for remote environmental sensing is provided. For systems that operate in a pulsed mode and are limited by photon noise, the signal-to-noise ratio can be expressed simply in terms of an effective signal irradiance which involves the whole spectral region of interest, and a single number which is the system's noise-equivalent irradiance (NEI) at the peak-response wavelength of the detector. A compact expression of the NEI is derived for background fluxes representative of situations encountered with contemporary radiation-shielded detector packages operating in the earth's atmosphere. In conjunction with the definition of an effective signal irradiance for extended targets, the concept of a figure of merit for passive thermal-imaging equipment is introduced, and implications for system tradeoffs are discussed. The analysis is applied to evaluate an 8- to 14-μm airborne scanner from the point of view of angular resolution and thermal sensitivity; limitations imposed by optical diffraction effects, detector time constant, and detector size requirement are also considered. Angular resolutions of, say, 0.1 to 0.2 mrad exemplify the capabilities of the current generation of infrared imaging sensors."
"Analyses of microwave data from previous investigations have shown that radar signal return at Ka-band frequencies is sensitive to variations in the densities of plant communities, while the effective penetration of the vegetation is insignificant. However, data analysis in this study suggests that for defoliated vegetation, the penetrative effects of Ka-band radar energy can be recognized on the imagery format. Boundaries may be defined on the radar imagery that are directly related to differences in soil moisture content, irrespective of either the vegetation type or density. Use is made of the depolarized return signal to distinguish between differences due to soil moisture and gross vegetation differences, thus providing a practical advantage for a multipolarization mode."
"Properties of a side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) designed for geoscience rather than military use are presented. The speckled nature of usual single-frequency radar images may be reduced by averaging in azimuth and by averaging in range or transmitting excess range bandwidth. With synthetic aperture systems, averaging is possible in both range and azimuth, but only range averaging (excess bandwidth) is reasonable with most real-aperture systems. Multispectral sensing appears to offer advantages for radar comparable with those for photography, on the basis of experimental spectral response curves. Matching the transfer characteristics of receiver, recorder, and film is necessary to achieve quality images. Special techniques may be necessary to permit discriminating targets of similar radar return while at the same time allowing for the very wide total range of returns. The calibration necessary to achieve repeatable results and permit use of automatic data processing may be obtained by inserting a stepped sample of transmitter signal into the receiver to place calibration blocks on the image. Both multiple look-angle coverage with a single flight line and stereo can be achieved by use of fore-and-aft squinted antennas for alternate transmissions."
"Passive microwave measurements of the sea surface were made from Argus Island tower at 1.41, 8.36, and 19.34 GHz over a range in wind speeds from calm to 15 m/s. These measurements show a definite frequency-dependent correlation between the microwave brightness temperature and wind speed. This dependence results from roughness effects of the compact sea surface associated with wind-driven waves."
"To obtain information on the potential usefulness of a radar altimeter as a remote ocean sensor, an experimental description of the ocean radar reflectivity is needed. This can be derived from an investigation of the electromagnetic impulse response of the sea surface at vertical incidence over a wide range of sea state conditions. For this purpose, Naval Research Laboratory has assembled a 1-ns radar and placed it on the Chesapeake Light Tower where, with a moderate antenna size, high spatial resolution is obtained. By recording the return over several minutes, the radar reflection from different portions of the vertical water wave structure is measured. The average radar returns then present the effective impulse response of the ocean. Simultaneously with the radar measurements, wave staff measurements of the water wave structure are obtained so that the relation between the geometric and electromagnetic surface distribution can be established. Preliminary results are shown without interpretations to show the effectiveness of a nanosecond radar to measure the ocean surface characteristics."
"In order to obtain additional parameters to more fully and adequately characterize the signature of a complex sea state a short pulse length, about 10 ns long, scatterometer is proposed with signal processing circuits to perform spectral and threshold level analyses. The incorporation of this scatterometer in a nadir-axis oriented, conically scanned antenna beam should aid significantly in establishing the degree of correlation of the normalized radar cross section to the wind velocity vector over the ocean surface."
"The design and operational characteristics of a rocket-borne radio frequency (RF) capacitance probe for obtaining electron densities in the 60-100-km altitude are described. The design objective was to provide a simple inexpensive system suitable for synoptic measurements of electron density. Basically the probe consists of a coaxial capacitor which is exposed to the atmosphere. This capacitor is the frequency control element of a 5-MHz oscillator. As the dielectric constant is a function of the electron density within the capacitor dielectric, the oscillator frequency changes are related to electron density. A simple procedure, which ignored sheath effects, was used to calibrate the probes. Despite this calibration deficiency electron densities derived from data obtained during two test flights were reasonable and agreed with results obtained from other experiments in this altitude region."

 "A system is described for measuring atmospheric temperature, humidity, and wind speed continuously and simultaneously at more than one level between 50 and 600 m above the ocean or land surface. The design of the system is presented. This consists of a modulator-transmitter unit which is suspended from a tether line supported by a balloon and controlled by a winch. Data are transmitted by radio link to a receiver-demodulator and recorder at the surface. Results are given which show that the system is capable of acquiring simultaneous time series of meteorological variables at two levels. This presents a viable, though not complete, method for acquiring time series data in a region of the atmosphere previously poorly sampled. The data presented suggest that turbulent mixing in this layer is governed by moist plumes on a scale of 100 m or more. Spectra of humidity are in good agreement with the Kolmogoroff minus-five-thirds law in the inertial subrange between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz. These spectra seem consistent with previous findings and support the suggested scale and role of the moist plumes in the turbulent transfer processes in the subcloud layer."
"To obtain more reliable mean wind profiles in the Ekman layer of the atmosphere, a system of two precision pilot-balloon theodolites is used. The system uses continous digital recording from optical shaft encorders on portable stereo tape recorders. Resolution is 0.01°. Simultaneous reading is secured by radio-link triggering of the quartz-controlled internal working frequency. The advantages in using this system are more accurate information at greater heights and an increased number of ascents providing a more statistically meaningful mean profile."
"Bistatic-radar Bragg scattering of medium-to long-wavelength radio waves by ocean waves can be used as a means for observing directional ocean-wave spectra. Only moderate antenna directivity is required; areal and directional resolution are provided by high-resolution delay-Doppler processing of the radar echoes. Directional characteristics of long-wavelength (80-200 m) ocean waves have been observed using LORAN A transmission (1.85 MHz) and a receiver located 280 km from the transmitter. The received signals have been converted into a time-delay Doppler-frequency map and into a plot of normalized radar cross section σ0, as a function of directional ocean-wavenumber."
"When a radar antenna is pointed directly down at the sea surface, the return signal is caused mainly by specular points on the surface. In this case, the sea surface can be modeled as a collection of Poisson-distributed point scatterers, each having a certain radar range and a certain vertical velocity. This model can be characterized by a deterministic function, called the scatterer density function, which is the density of specular point scatterers in the two-dimensional range-velocity space. This function can be estimated by using a high-resolution random-signal radar and provides information relating the dynamic aspects of the ocean surface to the distribution of wave heights. A special case of this problem is the estimation of average wave height, or sea state, and a specific technique to estimate this quantity is proposed and analyzed. This technique has the advantage of being a direct estimation procedure; i.e., the quantity measured is wave height, not a quantity that has been empirically related to wave height."
"Measurements were made in the laboratory of the emissivities of a variety of bubble and foam samples at a wavelength of 3.2 cm. The technique was an active one in which the absorptivities of the samples were determined. Both free-space and waveguide measurements were made, and emissivities were found to be near 0.6 for some single-layer bubble rafts and near 1.0 for mixed foams of 3- to 4-mm thickness. These measurements support the previously expressed belief that it should be possible to infer sea state and approximate wind speed from passive microwave measurements interpreted in percentage of foam coverage."
"An experiment that has been designed to yield the dielectric and loss properties of the ice cap near Byrd Station, Antarctica, in the very low-frequency range, subsequent to proper interpretation of the input admittance of an electrically short dipole probe, is described. The probe is lowered into a deep drill hole, together with appropriate measuring and telemetering equipment, in order that the parameters of interest may be recorded as functions of vertical depth and frequency. The motivation for such an experiment is discussed and the environmental conditions described, insofar as they restrict the kinds of experimental procedures that can be carried out with reasonable safety and economy. The measurement technique itself is outlined, together with some background material concerning the use of a dipole antenna as a probe for exploring the properties of the medium in which it is immersed. Also discussed is a related experiment performed to provide a check on the method. It involved the use of the same probe and instrumentation to measure the complex permittivity of sawdust, a lossy dielectric material. The results are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained by a more conventional laboratcry method."
"Some average pulse-shape measurements of radar sea returns at near-vertical incidence are presented. The measurements were made at a 75-cm wavelength, from light aircrafts flying at altitudes of 2 to 2.3 km over various water surfaces. Greater knowledge of the return shapes could help the design of high-accuracy radar altimeters. It could also contribute to several areas of remote sensing. Both specular and scattered reflections were observed in all the returns, with clear distinction between the two components. Dominance by either the specular or the scattered component was observed, the first one being the more frequent. Real-time averaging was obtained by utilizing a sampling technique. This enabled a reduction of the system bandwidth to several hertz, allowing the use of low peak-power RF pulses (1 W), and low-speed chart recorders. Twenty-one recorded average returns are given, along with an interpretation of the recordings and a description of the measuring system."

"For large color areas of the TV picture, station demodulators and some receivers with a composite video output signal produce different amounts of RF quadrature distortion than home receivers. Furthermore, the station demodulators that are delay equalized have a different group delay characteristic than that of home receivers and some remote receivers that provide a composite video output signal."
"An analytic expression, in terms of quadrature components, is derived for an NTSC color television signal which has experienced linear phase and amplitude distortion. Chromaticity charts are then used to describe the subjective effects of this distortion, and a method for automatic equalization of this distortion at the receiver is proposed."
"The sine-squared pulse response of a C-R-L circuit is worked out to gain insight into the influence of bandwidth limitation without delay equalization on the response to a sine-squared pulse. Since the results are normalized to the half-amplitude duration of the pulse, they apply to any such pulse. Graphs are presented of pulse-to-bar ratio versus bandwidth and of lobe-to-pulse ratio versus bandwidth. Furthermore, for the purpose of estimating the best K-rating to be expected from minimum-phase low-pass real circuits, the relation between minmum K-factor (resulting from optimum circuit arrangement) and bandwidth is given in tabular and graph form."
"Videotape recorders in professional broadcasting use require electronic time-base correcting devices to stabilize the timing of the output signal to the accuracy needed by color television. Many schemes have been used or proposed for this purpose. The method described is arranged to provide an unusually large operating range, thereby permitting its associated recorder to be designed for fast starting time, quick recovery from large disturbances, and fully synchronous operation. The technique involves the use of switched fixed ultrasonic delay lines whose delay times are arranged in a binary order, followed by a conventional continuously variable vernier delay line. A new method of direct measurement of velocity errors is incorporated in the system."

"General-purpose (truly versatile) home interactive terminals with TV frame storage, relaying \"still\" color TV pictures produced and transmitted by computers via CATV (or equivalent) cable systems (or networks) may be one of the coming major technological developments of the future, having tremendous potential in such areas as business, education, medicine, etc. The user in his home or office could converse with computers through his terminal's touchtone keyboard and TV. Hard copy (initially or Polaroid camera) could also be provided."
"Communication by broadcasting, although most effective in terms of broad area coverage at relatively low cost, is subject to reception interference which is often uncontrollable. In heavily populated urban areas these severe and changing interference problems, as well as limited electromagnetic spectrum, are inherent to the environment. Communication by wire, a point-to-point coverage independent of the electromagnetic spectrum, presents a solution to these problems. The communications engineering community is encouraged to develop transmission standards for the wired system that are compatible with broadcast transmission standards, and transmission testing for wired systems is reviewed."
"An analysis has been performed relative to the behavior of signal levels of CATV cable transmission systems, these signal levels being the result of a combination of monochrome television carriers, color television carriers, television FM sound carriers, and FM broadcast band carriers. From the information obtained, it has been possible to identify the effects of slowly varying phenomena and to propose measurement techniques which will yield meaningful results."
"An AM stereophonic system is described which is compatible with existing receivers and transmitters, does not increase interference, and allows stereophonic reception with two conventional AM sets as presently found in many homes, or inexpensive home receiving equipment specifically designed for AM stereo."
"A monaural signal of broadcast quality may not always be produced by the simple combination of stereophonic information. Loss of musical balance, distortion from poor disk tracking, and phase cancellation are among the problems encountered."

 "Telecommunications has developed dramatically since Marconi. Technological advances making possible new services have had a profound impact on society. Electronic communications have become an integral and essential part of modern life. They have changed the pace of life, have broadened perspectives, made cultural demands more sophisticated."
"Economists have argued in the past that the frequency spectrum should be sold or leased to the highest bidder. Because of technical and political problems with that suggestion, this paper proposes an alternative. As a first step, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should consider making license fees proportional to bandwidth times population in the area of coverage. This would create an incentive for users to transmit on smaller bandwidths and in low population areas or to switch from over-the-air transmission to transmission by wire. Some practical problems with the proposed solution are also discussed."
"A system for transmitting and receiving three independent stereophonic channels by FM multiplex is described. This system has the advantage of being compatible with monophonic and two-channel stereophonic FM receivers without any significant loss in their output signal-to-noise ratios (less than 1 dB) and without having to utilize any part of the SCA band. Compatibility of the three-channel stereophonic receiver with a one-or two-channel broadcast is achieved by the use of an additional pilot signal that does not cause any increase in the instantaneous frequency deviation of the FM carrier. The additional noise in the output of the three-channel receiver appears to be less than 6 dB above the noise that is now present in two-channel receivers."
"Equipment is now available to utilize the vertical interval of the television signal to transmit digital information. A vertical interval (VI) encoder selects any line, 13 through 20, onto which is clocked the data originating from a character generator, computer or other digital device. At the receiving point, data are decoded for display in \"real time\" using a character generator, printed out in hard copy, or used to initiate electromechanical operations through proper interfaces."
"The concept of short-time waveform distortion (SD) permits us to express in numbers the subjective quality of fine details in a TV picture. Various schemes to do so are briefly reviewed in order to find a method that will apply most advantageously for the system MU. S. and Canada (4 MHz, 525 lines). Having chosen the T-step technique, an oscilloscope graticule is presented together with methods of determining short-time waveform distortion arithmetically without a graticule."

"A new approach for obtaining the audio power required for high-level plate modulation of AM broadcast transmitters is described. The advantages of this system are lower initial cost, broader frequency response, lower distortion, transmitter output adjustable from zero to full output, lower power consumption, fewer amplifier tubes, and lower operating cost."
"As part of an industry study by an Ad Hoc Committee for the Joint Committee for Intersociety Coordination into color TV transmission and reception problems resulting in color differences, a subcommittee, under the auspices of the National Association of Broadcasters, made a study of the possible contributing effect being made by the use of Color Video Processing Amplifiers. The committee study indicates that four or more color video processing amplifiers may be used between the point of origination and the TV transmitter. Cumulative errors in two or more processing amplifiers in cascade can result in signal distortion. Minimized use of color processing amplifiers appears to be in order and is recommended by the committee."
"The selection of frequencies in the Television Auxiliary Broadcast Service has not heretofore been a matter of great concern because of the relative lack of congestion in the auxiliary broadcast bands as compared to other microwave bands. However, this situation is changing, particularly in the popular 6875-7125-MHz band. The authors first describe a systematic procedure for selecting frequencies in this band that avoids interference both to and from existing auxiliary broadcast stations, including mobile stations, using only data available from FCC files. They next describe a computer program that has greatly improved the speed and efficiency of what is otherwise a tedious manual operation."
"For the measurement of tolerable background-noise levels in broadcasting studios a high-sensitivity low-noise microphone, as well as a low-noise preamplifier, are required."

  "Many large scale problems which arise from real-life situations simply do not fit into classical molds and one must be satisfied with near optimal solutions as obtained by combining formal arguments with heuristic reasoning. For example practically nothing is known about nonlinear integer programs and yet one of the first problems we encountered was of this type. What was there to do? Similarly, when faced with problems of routing trucks and barges for waste disposal, it became apparent that the usual graph theoretic arguments were not directly applicable. Nevertheless, a workable approach was formulated. Analogous problems exist in airline crew scheduling, in the design of gas or sewer pipeline networks, and in legislative committee assignments. Another area which has responded well to heuristics is in the scheduling of employees who work for public services. The personnel requirements vary with each day and shift. Nevertheless, rotating schedules have been devised which meet the work demands in a satisfactory way while guaranteeing a minimum number of days off."
"This paper summarizes a new graduate course focusing on an area of very recent quantitative research: urban service systems (e.g., police and fire departments, emergency ambulance services, mass transit systems). At one level the course presents a unified study of geometrical probability, multiserver queuing theory, spatial location theory, scheduling and sequencing techniques, and relevant methods of simulation. At a second level students are asked to structure a comprehensive quantitative approach to a set of problems actually experienced by one agency, entailing interaction with the agency. This paper reviews the course as taught in the 1971 Spring Term and discusses applications in evaluating various types of urban technology."
 "An adaptive filter is developed which tracks a re-entry vehicle which is ballistic at first and suddenly executes a deterministic or random maneuver. To verify when the maneuver occurs as soon as possible, on the average, a Wald Sequential Test is used. This decision then changes the gains of the acceleration state variables via a stochastic approximation algorithm, which generates the input covariance."
"This paper presents an efficient suboptimal decision algorithm for associating (correlating) sensor data with stored tracks in a real-time track-while-scan surveillance system. For the first time, the performance and computational burden of such an algorithm is derived analytically. The results provide considerable insight into the correlation process, and permit the tracking system designer to select and trade off various tracking and correlation parameters, to achieve acceptable performance and implementation cost without resorting to detailed and costly computer simulations required by previous ad hoc approaches to the problem."
 "The vortex flow[1,2] in the wake of a large airplane is hazardous to other aircraft, particularly during landing. For the first time, modern methods of parameter identification have been applied to the analysis of vortex flow. Because the identification problem involves parameters which are nonlinearly related, an iterative method is required. A modified Newton-Raphson method3,4 was employed to calculate a maximum likelihood estimate of the unknown parameters. The estimate is related to one which minimizes the mean-square difference between the measured and calculated flow velocities. This iterative procedure had been previously used to determine stability derivatives of airplanes from flight data.4"
 "Because many systems of practical interest fall outside the scope of linear theory it is desirable to enlarge as much as possible the class of systems for which a complete structure theory is available. In this paper a class of finite state sequential systems evolving in groups is considered. The concepts of controllability, observability, minimality, realizability, and the isomorphism of minimal realizations are developed. Results which are analogous to - but differ in essential details from - those of linear system theory are derived. These results are potentially useful in such diverse areas as algorithmic design and algebraic coding."
 "The invertibility, reproducibility and decoupling of the class of systems of the Hammerstein form is studied. The criteria for invertibility and reproducibility are given in terms of those of the linear dynamic subsystem and in terms of the memoryless nonlinearity in the feedforward path (independently of feedback). It is shown that such a system can be decoupled by dynamic precompensation and (nonlinear) state feedback if and only if it is invertible. For static (no dynamics) decoupling, and additional requirement, namely, the static (G,F)-decouplability of the linear dynamic subsystem, is needed."
"This paper provides some necessary conditions and some sufficient conditions for the null controllability of constant linear systems and a class of time-varying linear systems. The approach provides geometrical interpretations of the usual algebraic criteria and gives insight into the effects of restrained controls. The results show that controllability of a linear system imposes relationships among the cyclic subspaces (algebraic structure of the system), the eigenvalues, and the control restraint set."
"A method of converting a picture into a \"cartoon\" or \"map\" whose regions correspond to differently textured regions is described. Texture edges in the picture are detected, and solid regions surrounded by these (usually broken) edges are \"colored in\" using a propagation process. The resulting map is cleaned by comparing the region colors with the textures of the corresponding regions in the picture, and also by merging some regions with others according to criteria based on topology and size. The method has been applied to the construction of cloud cover maps from cloud cover pictures obtained by satellites."
"Many economic problems are naturally modeled as dynamic optimization problems, therefore control theory methods have already found substantial use in economics and are likely to find increasing use in the future. A survey is presented here of the principal uses of control theory by economists in macroeconomic (economy wide) and microeconomic (firm, personal, or sectoral) problems."
"An algorithm for computing the relative maxima of objective functions constrained by nonlinear, nonconcave models is employed to analyze the behavior and policy implications of an intermediate size nonlinear econometric model. A behavioral test is constructed to determine which of the sets of point estimates of the unknown parameters are consistent with economic theory. The model's evaluation of the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy versus fiscal policy is analyzed. An inflation test is constructed to evaluate the model's realism."
"This paper describes experimental calculations of shadow prices for evaluation of investment projects in the Chilean economy. These are based on a growth model emphasizing the dependence of Chile on foreign trade, especially imports of capital goods. For this reason two state variables are used-one standing for plant-type capital produced by a non-traded sector and the other representing equipment-type capital which must be imported. These imports are paid for by exogenous traditional exports, and exports from a traded goods sector. The model thus determines allocation of imported and domestic factors between the two sectors, and the corresponding pricing policy. Numerical results show (i) a rate of discount consistent with the results of other rate-of-return studies in Chile; (ii) an almost flat transformation surface between the traded and nontraded sectors, with a correspondingly inflexible relative price ratio; (iii) inverse proportionality between tariffs and the exchange rate, which follows essentially from the flat transformation surface. This last result is inconsistent with partial equilibrium estimates of the shadow exchange rate, and some doubt is raised as to what is the \"true\" value of this shadow price."
"Short-term economic stabilization policy is approached as a problem in optimal control. The optimal control problem is defined as a dual discrete time tracking problem (nominal state and nominal policy trajectories are tracked) for a linear time-invariant system with a quadratic cost functional. This problem is solved analytically, and the solution is applied to a 28 state variable quarterly econometric model. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach is valuable both as a tool for policy planning and as a method of analyzing the dynamic properties of econometric models."
"This paper formulates the problem of determining the optimal stabilization policy for a simple macroeconomic model as a state-regulator problem. In the general case where the government has a finite planning horizon and where investment is generated by a flexible accelerator the optimal government policy is shown to satisfy a first order linear differential equation with variable coefficients. With an infinite horizon these coefficients become constants and upon integrating the equation the optimal government expenditure is seen to be a mixture of a proportional and an integral policy. When the simplet instantaneous accelerator is assumed the policy becomes purely proportional. In the latter part of the paper this case is extended to the situtation where various parameters characterizing the economy are stochastic. Similar control laws are obtained, although in this case the intensity of control will depend upon the noise in the system."
"A new approach to the exact model matching problem is given based on an algorithm for characterizing the input-output structural properties of a linear system. In contrast to previous methods, the state feedback matching problem is solved without recourse to initial coordinate transformations. Moreover, the algorithm given here extends directly to the dynamic model matching problem and yields a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for one system to be transfer function equivalent via dynamic state feedback to a specified model system."
"Many optimal control problems generally lead to solutions that require complete state feedback for their implementation. For many practical applications, however, not all states are available for direct measurement. The use of an auxiliary dynamic feedback system, such as an observer, is one approach to the design of a controller that generates an asymptotic estimate of the desired optimal control input. However, a simpler design is desirable and is often possible by means of the theory of compatible suboptimal controllers presented in this paper."
 "One introduces a differential representation of the set of the solutions of the linear, controllable systems. One also solves the related problem of finding a complete set of independent invariants for these systems."
 "A class of optimization problems is investigated in which some of the functions, continuous in all their arguments, have continuous right and left hand derivatives but are not equal at a point called the corner. For this nonclassical problem, a set of first order necessary conditions for stationarity is determined for an optimal path which may have arcs lying on a corner for a nonzero length of time. Enough conditions are provided to constuct an extremal path. This, in part, is achieved by noting that the corner defines a manifold in which the derivatives of all the functions are uniquely defined. Two examples, representing possible aggregate production and employment planning models, illustrate the theory."
"A computational method developed by Jacobson is used for solving quantized control problems. At each iteration, the system equations are integrated forward in time using the current nominal control, and accessory equations, which yield the changes in the switch times of the optimal control, are integrated in reverse to obtain an improved control. This improved control is then used as the new nominal control for the next iteration. By continued iteration, the procedure produces control functions which successively improve the approximation to the optimal control function,"
"The problem of estimation of state in non-linear dynamical systems containing time delays is studied. The plant is specified by a set of non-linear differential-difference equations. Observations are a nonlinear function of current and/or delayed states. Both contain additive disturbances. The criterion used for the optimal estimates is the integral of the weighted squared error. Using the theory of the calculus of variations, equations are developed for the estimation. They are first expressed in the form of a split boundary value problem, which is then converted to an initial value problem for on-line estimation. The result yields a sequential estimation scheme in which filtered and smoothed estimates are computed in a sequential manner. The applicability of the procedure is demonstrated by a practical example."
"Kalman-Bucy (K/B) filtering assumes that the linear dynamic system and corresponding noise statistics are exactly known. When this information is only approximately known, an optimum bounding filter can be designed for specific versions (steady state time-invariant with scalar observations) of the K/B problem. A system is designed in which the actual estimation error covariance is bounded by the covariance calculated by the estimator. Therefore, the estimator obtains a bound on the actual error covariance which is not available and also the apparent divergence is prevented. The bounding filter can be designed to be of lower order than the original system, however, this results in a higher error covariance. Conditions for the design of the optimum (minimum mean square error) bounding filter within a permissible class are derived. Since the specific K/B problem is formulated as an equivalent Wiener filtering problem, therefore, all the results are applicable to the design of bounding filters for Wiener problems. The design of a bounding filter is illustrated by an example."
"A brief survey of the field of data smoothing for dynamic systems is presented."
"In the design of optimal estimators it is common to consider some function of the error covariance matrix, usually the trace, as a criterion of optimality. In the design of optimal inputs, or probing signals, for parameter estimation it is more natural to consider functions of the Fisher information matrix instead. The input which maximizes the Fisher information measure for efficient estimation of a scalar parameter also provides the minimum error variance. The information is thus a logical choice for the optimality criterion in scalar problems. No such obvious choice is apparent for vector parameter estimation, however. In this paper we examine and compare a number of performance measures and select a useful criterion. The design of an optimal probing signal using this criterion is shown to be equivalent to an optimal control problem in which certain equality constraints must be satisfied. This problem may be solved by conventional techniques of deterministic or stochastic optimal control."
 "This paper develops a new optimal tracking filter that accounts for and minimizes the effects of correlation uncertainties in surveillance systems. This filter reduces to the Kalman filter in the limiting case of no correlation errors and infinite gate sizes, and provides substantially improved performance in environments wherein correlation uncertainties cannot be ignored."
 "Associated with control systems are certain Lie algebras of first-order partial differential operators; we show how they may be used to study controllability properties of the system and to obtain conditions for the existence of probability densities of related stochastic systems."
 "A brief survey of recent results on nonlinear controllability is presented, and a new theorem is stated and proved, giving an \"exact time\" analogue of Chow's Theorem. In a series of recent papers (Brockett[1], Haynes and Hermes[4], Kucera[7][8], Lobry[9][10], Jurdjevic and Sussmann[5], Sussmann[12][13][14], Sussmann and Jurdjevic[15]) the methods of Differential Geometry have been applied to the study of accessibility and controllability problems for non-linear systems. We shall survey some aspects of this recent work."
"A new automated procedure for the computer-aided design of linear, time-invariant, multivariable control systems is developed for the case where the design specifications are given in the frequency domain in the form of stability margins, loop gains, and closed-loop frequency responses. The procedure minimizes a cost (penalty) function which measures the deviation of the system responses from those specified to obtain the required fixed-configuration compensation to meet the specifications. The procedure is applied to a representative aircraft control system design problem using three local search techniques (optimium step-size gradient, Fletcher-Powell, and Rosenbrock pattern search) and a new \"global\" random search technique for the required minimizations. The new \"global\" random search technique appears to be superior to the local search techniques for the class of problems studied."
 "In the design of feedback control systems, modern techniques are often neglected in favor of the more classical trial and error techniques due to the difficulty of incorporating practical engineering constraints. This paper attempts to present algorithms that may overcome some of these difficulties. Efficient computational techniques from linear algebra are stressed as a means of making nonlinear programming and parameter optimization algorithms practical."
"This paper presents the theory and a technique for compensator improvement. Several definitions in regard to relative stability are presented along with some frequency response limitations and characteristics of a large space vehicle. A non-linear programming algorithm for obtaining an improved solution for a strict constraint problem is developed and the necessary partial derivatives for applying the algorithm to compensator improvement are derived. Finally, for illustrating the effectiveness of the algorithm, the frequency response of a large space vehicle is improved."
"Computational Methods for solving the steady-state matrix Riccati equation are described. Theoretical advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods are discussed and asymptotic estimates of execution time in terms of the system dimension are indicated. Through experimental verification it is seen that asymptotic estimates may be misleading over a significant range of system dimensions."
"A feature extraction algorithm has been successfully applied to knee x-rays. The four main features of the algorithm are: (1) A description of the picture class guides the feature extraction; (2) The search for objects is global to local; (3) A region enumeration technique finds regions of contiguous points with similar gray shades; and (4) A 'field of vision' concept aids in classifying all the points in a given area of the picture."
"Several years ago the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated the development of a reader to extract detailed information from single fingerprints. The fine details or minutiae consist of the position and angle of ridge endings and bifurcations, A free standing laboratory reader now exists which accepts an inked fingerprint at its input and outputs this minutia data."
"This paper describes some preliminary work in the development of a methodology for the classification, organization, and analysis of diagnostic data (both quantitative and qualitative) for the purposes of creating taxa, and subsequently establishing statistical inferences concerning the delineation of high and low risk target populations. Specifically, the methodology encompasses: 1. Numerical taxonomic techniques and Q-mode clustering (with dendrograms) in conjunction with factor analysis methods employing various orthogonal and non-orthogonal rotations, i.e., principal components, varimax, quartimax, quartimin, bi-quartimin, covarimin, and direct quartimin. These clustering techniques are applied to physiological data utilizing both correlation and distance function matrices as the basis for the generation of taxa, and further classifications; 2. Multivariate statistical analysis, including linear discriminant functions, and polynominal regression for analyzing the overall structure of the data, as well as formulating and testing statistical hypotheses concerning the allocation of individuals to existing taxa. The methodology itself has served to focus attention upon the gaps existing in the economic computer processing of large volumes of data, and has given considerable impetus to the development of a compendium of sophisticated computer techniques."
"This paper describes a procedure for sequentially selecting and ordering features. It is applicable to sequential decision schemes for the computer-aided diagnosis of discrete-valued medical data patterns. The procedure is optimal in minimizing the diagnostic error probability. Preliminary application results are described."
"In the study of an object or a system, one must first of all describe it through interrelating the variables which are considered most relevant to the modeling of the system. However in many cases, the attributes of a system are ambiguous as in the case of handwritten characters; for there is no clear-cut definition of, say, handwritten \"five\". The characters \"5\", \"5\", \"5\", and \"5\" are somehow all recognized as \"five\". For machine recognition of this seemingly ill-defined object, it is necessary to be able to describe it analytically. One attempt is made in this paper to model the handwritten characters. The handwritten characters are directed graphs[1], the branch set of which are fuzzily classified to the branch types such as straight lines, circles and parts of a circle; the branch types in turn are considered as fuzzy variables[2]. A fuzzy function is then synthesized to model each handwritten character by relating fuzzy variables."
"Exponentially weighted running statistics of electroencephalograms (EEG) from the motor cortex and dorsal hippocampus of rabbits were obtained using a special purpose analog computer designed for this research. The EEG of spontaneous arousal and drug-induced behavioral states under amphetamine and pentobarbital was studied. It appears that variability in the central nervous system (CNS) as expressed by the running variance contains valuable information about the state of the CNS. The results show that amphetamine arousal is different from spontaneous arousal in that under amphetamine a state of \"hyperarousal\" appears to exist. The transition from arousal to pentobarbitalinduced sedation appears to be a stage-wise process and exhibits \"undershoots\" and \"overshoots\" in the cortical-hippocampal interstructural variability. It appears that the running mean and running variance are particularly useful statistics for the analysis of nonstationary bioelectric signals."
"A new data base for syntax-directed pattern analysis and recognition is introduced by generalizing the notion of concatenation in representing patterns with a relationship matrix. The characteristics of relationship matrix are demonstrated in the context of formal language theory. It is shown that this data base will allow us to remove many of the present restrictions placed on the types of patterns that can be handled by syntax-directed systems."
"A class of nonstationary environments with unknown but periodically changing probabilistic characteristics is considered. It is proposed to optimize the performance in an environment from this class by using a two-level system of variable-structure stochastic automata. The first level estimates the unknown period while the second level operates suitably in the environment for one cycle assuming that this estimate is the true period of the environment. The average output of the environment in this cycle is used as the input to the first level to determine the next estimate of the period. The optimal performance of this two-level system of automata in periodic random environments is demonstrated through computer simulations."
"A method for accelerating the convergence in model reference adaptive control systems is presented. The novel feature is to feedback an appropriate function of the parameter misalignment signal to each adjusting mechanism channel. The adaptive loops incorporating feedback can be synthesized either directly from a Liapunov Function or indirectly from the minimization of a Liapunov function along the steepest descent path. In both cases, the derivative of the Liapunov function is negative definite in error and parameter misalignment, whereas it is only semi-definite in previous work. The advantages are easy implementation, and rapid convergence to zero of both the system response error and the errors of the adjustable parameters. Simulation studies on a second order system confirm the theoretical predictions."
"The problem of adaptive control of high-order nonlinear time-varying systems is solved by using low-order linear models to approximate, in a piece-wise optimal manner, the response of the system. Extensive use is made of recent, highly efficient gradient search technique. The theory is illustrated by an application to a nuclear power reactor."
"For the quadratic cost, nonlinear, adaptive stochastic control problem with linear discrete plant and measurement models excited by white gaussian noise, and unknown time-invariant model parameters, the optimal stochastic control is obtained and shown to separate (\"Nonlinear Separation Theorem\") into a bank of model-conditional deterministic control gains and a corresponding bank of known nonlinear functionals of the model-conditional, causal, mean-square state-vector estimates. This separation may also be viewed as a decomposition of the optimal, nonlinear adaptive control into a bank of model-conditional optimal, non-adaptive linear controls, one for each admissible value of the unknown parameter θ and a nonlinear part, namely, the bank of a-posteriori model probabilities, which incorporate the adaptive nature, of the optimal adaptive control. Results are given for several special cases of the above problem that exhibit drastically reduced computational requirements. These are the cases of (a) uncertainty in the measurement matrix only; and (b) the case of completely known models, but with nongaussian initial state-vector. In both special cases, we have explicit separation between control and estimation. Moreover, in both cases only one deterministic controller is required to be used with the nonlinear, adaptive mean-square state-vector estimate. Several illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the adaptive control algorithm developed in this paper."
"In this paper conditions are given which ensure the stability of a random search algorithm being used as a minimization tool for unknown systems subject to random disturbances in the system parameters."
"The formulation of a parameter adaptive control problem is discussed in which a reference model with adjustable structure is updated along with the controller parameters in order to be assured that the performance index is a convex function over each evaluation interval."
"A steepest descent variable step-size algorithm has been designed using dynamic programming for an MSE equalizer. Additive noise and a constraint have been included. It is found that the new algorithm converges faster than the common fixed step-size algorithm."
"A stochastic model describing small eye movements occurring during steady fixation on a stationary target is presented. Based on eye movement data for steady gaze, the model has a hierarchical structure; the principal level represents the random motion of the image point within a local area of fixation while the higher level mimics the jump processes involved in transitions from one local area to another. Target image motion within a local area is described by a Langevin-like stochastic differential equation taking into consideration the microsaccadic jumps pictured as being due to point processes and the high frequency muscle tremor, represented as a white noise. The transform of the probability density function for local area motion is obtained, leading to explicit expressions for their means and moments. Evaluation of these moments based on the model are comparable with experimental results. A physiologically based criterion for the occurrence of local area changes is assumed and the renewal density of these transitions is obtained. These transitions are brought about by the occurrence of large saccades. Hence, our analysis leads us to derive expressions for the mean and moments of the occurrence of large saccades in a given time T. These predictions may be checked against experimental results."
"Use of some aspects of modern control theory for stabilization and control of an unstable fourth-order macroeconomic model is explored. Satisfactory control algorithms for both instantaneous state feedback and for the more realistic case of output feedback with measurement delays are derived. Application is made of observer theory together with pole placement results for state and observer feedback. A detailed numerical example illustrates the discussion."
"The lagging economy and high inflation of recent years can be quantitatively explained by a dynamic model which is based on well known structural equations and equations on price and wage reflecting collective bargaining and limited monopoly. Using the dynamic model, the effects of various economic policies are studied."
"The basic principles of Leontief's input-output analysis to assess environmental effects[1] can be derived from a systems engineering viewpoint, using multivariable block diagrams. The advantage of the systems engineering interpretation is to make the input-output analysis intuitively clear and to suggest, and facilitate certain extensions of Leontief's results."
"This work describes a sensitivity analysis of the Forrester urban model. Using small perturbations about the system trajectories, sensitivity matrices were computed at 135 years (growth period) and 240 years (equilibrium). The results show a matrix heavily weighted to give large sensitivity coefficients to the three housing variables. In the housing sectors the feedback loops containing the growth rate parameters were found to contribute most to the sensitivity. Finally, sensitivity coefficients of the level variables with respect to a number of model parameters were found. In general, their contribution to overall model sensitivity was quite small when compared to the loop sensitivity described above."
"The mixed-integer programming technique is applied to an actual river basin and shown to be a feasible and appropriate method for the selection of minimum-cost solutions to the pollution abatement planning problem."
"The main purpose of the study is to derive a penalty function which will seek an efficient production technology for producing a certain amount of commodities with a minimum amount of pollution. In this study production is regarded as the only source of pollution. The pollutant is treated as any other commodity and is directly related to the flow of material production, the level of technology and the final demand for goods. The pollutants are quantified in some common abstract unit of measurement. The problem of pollution estimation is treated within the traditional static input-output framework with an added feature of pollution creation and pollution elimination activities."
"During the last decade, system analysis has moved into a more dominant role in transportation planning. Many of the larger cities have followed the lead of Detroit and Chicago in establishing citywide planning activities based on comprehensive statistics and systematic use of mathematical models. Attempts at regional planning have been seen in the Penn-Jersey study and the Northeast Corridor Project and a recent national effort was undertaken by the U.S. Department of Transportation for the 1972 National Transportation Report to Congress. In all of these an extensive use of mathematical modeling has been employed to describe intercity transportation."
"Transportation modeling is but part of a larger iterative decision and control process. As in all such processes if undue distortion, time delay, phase shift or noise exist, disruption of normal system operation will result. Examples of this include attempts to skip portions of the overall process such as the generation of alternatives, the consideration of criteria in evaluation, the analysis phase or the problem reformulation phase. Essential to successful administration of projects involving modeling is frequent two-way high-level contact between decision maker and modelers, the presence of a coordinator to perform liaison between the typical sociopolitical decision maker and the typical quantitative-technical analyst, the phasing of studies into modestly sized doable pieces, and the recognition of the roles of, and by, both the decision makers and the analysts. Some improvement in communication techniques and role recognition may be expected with the passage of time as more people enter decision-making positions who grew up in the computer era."
"This paper shows that extensions of the Frank-Wolfe, Zoutendijk, and Pironneau-Polak algorithms for nonlinear programming problems, can also be used to solve various optimal control problems."
 "The generalized programming algorithm consists of major iterations and minor iterations; each major iteration consists of many minor iterations. A major iteration terminates with the addition of a Gomory cut. A minor iteration corresponds to the solution of a master linear programming problem and a group optimization problem. Activities can be deleted at the end of each minor iteration as the result of new lower bounds generated during the minor iteration. The algorithm allows most of the integer programming columns to be kept in secondary storage and evaluated in core one at a time."
 "We report some of the results of a study of asymptotically optimum nonparametric training procedures for two-category pattern classifiers. The decision surfaces yielded by earlier forms of nonparametric training procedures generally do not minimize the probability of error. We derive a modification of the Robbins-Monro method of stochastic approximation, and show how this modification leads to training procedures that minimize the probability of error of a one-dimensional two-category pattern classifier. The class of probability density functions admitted by these training procedures is quite broad, permitting a combination of continuous and discrete components in the density functions. We show that the sequence of decision points generated by any of these training procedures converges with probability one to the minimum-probability-of-error decision point."
"This paper describes algorithmic methods which result in a reasonable discrete estimate of the shape of a probability density function (pdf). A finite number of samples known to have been selected from the governing density function are used to iteratively develop these successively better estimates. Two classes of deterministic algorithms are described. The first class is heuristically derived, and the second class results from maximizing the entropy of the estimate as an index of performance. Variations of the algorithms are compared and results presented as to rate of convergence, limit cycle stability, and ease of implementation. The techniques may be readily applied to the approximation of non-linear functions by zero order quantizers, and extended to the n dimensional case."
"This paper considers supervised learning, structure and parameter adaptive binary pattern recognition when a nongaussian pattern is observed in gaussian noise. To facilitate a feasible solution, certain judicious approximations are made use of. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the learning capability of the proposed algorithms."
"Significant similarities exist among models of simple human learning and trainable pattern classifiers. Such similarities have recently been demonstrated quantitatively in the case of human auditory signal detection and the author's \"threshold learning process\" [1]. This leads us to hope that the development of techniques for designing training procedures for threshold learning processes and pattern classifiers will be transferrable to the design of training procedures for human perception."
   "A nonlinear state estimator has been developed to solve the problem of a randomly switching plant operating in white Gaussian noise. A switching plant by definition has certain key parameters that can vary randomly within a finite set of real values. In modeling the stochastic system it will be assumed that the parameter variations will be described by a semi-Markov process. By incorporating the semi-Markovian concept into a Bayesian estimation scheme an adaptive state estimator was developed which could handle the switching plant or switching environment problem without computer storage increasing as time progresses."
"An algorithm is discussed which decomposes a noisy composite signal of identical but unknown multiple wavelets overlapping in time. The decomposition determines the number of wavelets present, their epochs, amplitudes and an estimate of the basic wavelet shape. The algorithm is an adaptive decomposition filter which is a combination of three separate filters. One is an adaptive cross-correlation filter which resolves the composite signal from noise by an iteration procedure; this is followed by a wavelet extraction filter which ferrets out the basic wavelet form, and last there appears an inverse filter which achieves decomposition of the composite signal in the time domain. The decomposition algorithm can be applied to echoes and overlapping wavelets which might arise in radar, sonar, seismology, or electrophysiology. The proposed theory has been thoroughly simulated and selected experimental results are presented to demonstrate the technique. These include decomposition of brain waves evoked by visual stimulation."
"In this paper we discuss the problem of deconvolution of the output of a linear system in the presence of noise. As formulated the problem is solvable by least-squares linear regression. A previously known technique for solving integral equations is applied. It is shown now this solution is equivalent to constrained linear regression and that this may be computed in the frequency domain. Finally, the relationship between deconvolution by constrained linear regression and by Wiener theory is derived."
"This paper describes an approach to dynamic modeling and on-line carbon estimation based on waste gas analysis in a basic oxygen furnace. As is well known, the basic oxygen process for steelmaking is highly stochastic in nature. There is, at present, no satisfactory model for predicting the decarbonization rate of the process. The first part of this paper considers approaches to on-line dynamic modeling. A two-stage dynamic model is developed using time-series analysis and empirical information on the decarbonization rate. This model is put in a state-vector form which is suitable for on-line estimation and control. The second part of the paper applies linear and nonlinear filtering to estimate the carbon and the decarbonization rate of the process during each heat. Since there is a time delay between the bath conditions md the measurements, the state of the system must be predicted. Two different methods for prediction are given. One is based on the present estimate of the carbon in the bath, and the other is based on the present estimate of the decarbonization rate of the bath. A combination of the two schemes is shown to provide better results than those achieved so far in practice. A total of 175 heats from a 220-ton BOF are processed and analyzed, and the results are discussed."
"This paper proposes an adaptive technique for estimating autocorrelation functions from a single trace by using a finite-time integrator whose gain and integration time can be programmed to approximate the optimum integrator. The appropriate algorithm is derived and the estimation errors are discussed."
"An on-line, model adjusting scheme for parameter identification in a class of distributive systems using trajectory sensitivity to parameter variations is given. It incorporates a discret time model adjustment algorithm during the normal operation of the system."
  "General causal linear-quadratic-gaussian team decision problems are considered here. The decision precedence relation is partially-ordered, but the information for each decision maker may not be partially-nested. A technique is developed to solve the difficult problem indirectly through the auxiliary problem by using equivalent controls."
"Many large industrial systems have several different modes of possible operation. The dynamic characterization of such a system at any specific point in time will depend upon the operational status of a number of individual components or subsystems. For example, the efficiency and stability of electrical generation and distribution system may change radically when an important generating station is lost from service because of an unexpected failure."
"A recursive, minimum-variance linear filter and controller is derived for systems in which white state-dependent noise appears in the system dynamics and measurements. The filter without control is a generalization of the Kalman filter and possesses many of its desirable properties. First, the discrete form of the filter is derived. By taking a formal limit, a continuous filter with convergence in distribution to an Ito representation is obtained. The concept of a perfect controller is given, showing the formal duality of the filter and controller with the stochastic controller derived by Wonham. Finally, some of the properties of the filter-controller system are illustrated through the use of a scalar example. It is shown that a filter-controller designed by neglecting the state-dependent noise can destabilize a dynamically stable system."
"Linear stochastic systems with convex performance criteria and convex, compact control regions are studied. The admissible control region is assumed to be a continuous function of the (perfectly) observed state. Optimal feedback controls are shown to exist within the class of Borel measurable functions of past states. In fact, they are shown to be continuous functions of the present state. Using dynamic programming the optimal return function is shown to be convex. Generalization of the results to quasi-convex cost functions is discussed and asymptotic results for stable systems are derived. These results are then used to explore several problems in aggregate production and workforce planning. Computational aspects of the results in the context of the smoothing problem are discussed."
"A rigorous proof by the innovations method is given for certain results on linear least-squares estimation, especially of the Stratonovich-Kalman-Bucy formulas. Some discussion is also given of the nonlinear problem."
"This paper deals with the compression of the data obtained from measurements in real-tome non-linear estimation problems. The purpose is to reduce the data processing requirements. Since data compression is never optimal, one always can expect a certain deterioration in the performance of the estimator when using the compressed data. However, it is shown theoretically that under certain conditions one can preprocess the raw measurement data such that the loss of information (in the sense of Fisher) is minimized. In this case, the estimation performance is practically the same as when no data compression is utilized. A specific application, the tracking of a reentry vehicle with a linearized filter, is discussed in more detail and simulation results are presented. The conditions derived theoretically are satisfied in this case and the results confirm this."
"For the nonlinear estimation problem with nonlinear plant and observation models, white gaussian excitations and continuous data, the state-vector a-posteriori probabilities for prediction, and smoothing are obtained via the \"partition theorem\". Moreover, for the special class of nonlinear estimation problems with linear models excited by white gaussian noise, and with nongaussian initial state, explicit results are obtained for the a-posteriori probabilities, the optimal estimates, and the corresponding error-covariance matrices for filtering, prediction, and smoothing. In addition, for the latter problem, approximate but simpler expressions are obtained by using a gaussian sum approximation of the initial state-vector probability density. As a special case of the above results, optimal linear smoothing algorithms are obtained in a new form."
"This paper deals with the application of the gradient iteration to a class of ill-posed estimation problems arising in many different contexts such as system and channel identification, radar mapping and resolution, enhancement or restoration of optical images, and so on. The basic problem is one of infinite-dimensional linear regression type where the unknown x is a function in an arbitrary functional Hilbert space h, and the observation noise is a second-order stochastic process. It is shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for the gradient iteration to define a sequence of estimates {x·p} within the constraint space h is one of strong stochastic nonsingularity for a hypothetical detection problem. Conditions that guarantee the convergence of the gradient iterates {x·p} in a suitable sense are also given."
 "The set of interrelated quality routing models described in this paper are useful for the prediction of the temporal and spatial distribution of temperature, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and conservative minerals within a segment of a river basin. The governing differential equation is solved by an implicit-finite-difference-technique under the assumption that advection along the primary axis of flow (longitudinal axis of the stream channel) is the primary mode of transport. Comparison of the predictions of this modeling system and field data from a segment of a river basin containing multiple headwater sources, waste loadings, and branching streams produced good agreement between predicted and observed quality profiles."
"The Reconnaissance Game is a pursuit-evasion game with state constraints in which the evader tries to reconnoiter a target from as close a distance as possible, while guaranteeing safe escape from a pursuer. The pursuer has capture capability but he also has a territorial constraint. The case of complete maneuverability and speed advantage with the pursuer is analyzed and an algorithm is developed for computing solutions. The similar cases of equal speed and speed advantage with the evader are also discussed."
"A method called dynamic modeling is used to obtain near optimal closed-loop control laws for a fixed-time pursuit-evasion differential game between two aircraft in a vertical plane. This dynamic modeling technique involves simplifying the aircraft dynamics until a closed-loop control law can be found. The closed-loop control law for the simplified game is then used as a basis for obtaining a near optimal closed-loop control law for the game with realistic aircraft dynamics. Results of two examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of this near optimal control law."
"In this paper the problem of optimal feedback control of uncertain discrete-time dynamic systems is considered where the uncertain quantities do not have a stochastic description but instead are known to belong to given sets. The problem is converted to a sequential minimax problem and dynamic programming is suggested as a general method for its solution. The notion of a sufficiently informative function, which parallels the notion of a sufficient statistic of stochastic optimal control, is introduced, and conditions under which the optimal controller decomposes into an estimator and an actuator are identified."
"An admissible minimax estimate is derived for the following statistical decision problem. Let z1 = x + u + v1 and z2 = x + v2, where x ε N[o, Q], v1 ε N[o, R1], v2 Χ N[o, R2], and u ε En. A statistician observes the random vector z1 and seeks a minimax estimate δ(z1) for the sum (x + u), under the generalized quadratic loss function defined by L(δ, u) = [δ - (x + u)]' C[δ - (x + u)] - u'du. Nature observes the random vector z2 and controls the value of the vector u, which she may make dependent on the observed value of z2. Both parties know the covariance matrices of the indicated normal random vectors, which are assumed to be statistically independent. The minimax decision rule is shown to be linear, and nature's optimum choice of u is shown to be u = Pz2, where the matrix P is determined by the solution to a certain nonlinear matrix equation."
"The purpose of this paper is to discuss the necessary condition for a non-inferior solution to an optimal control problem with vector-valued criterion function."
"A new approach to the solution of dynamic games of one-on-one combat is developed. By introducing two physically motivated assumptions, a meaningful discretized game formulation of the combat problem is obtained. Then, concepts of Markov processes and state increment dynamic programming are used to develop a feasible computational scheme for solving this problem. The method is demonstrated by applying it to a classical differential game, the Homocidal Chauffeur problem."
"In general a saddle point solution does not exist to the problem of min-max control for a system with uncertain parameters. By introduction of mixed strategies over the uncertainty set a min-max theorem is proven enabling interchange of the order of minimization and maximization without assumption of a saddle point solution. The min-max feedback control can then be characterized in terms of the solution of an integro-differential equation which is the analog of the Hamilton Jacobi equation obtained in the deterministic case. Consideration of the linear system quadratic criterion case leads to the usual form of linear feedback, however determination of the feedback matrix requires solution of coupled systems of Riccati differential equations. The equations obtained are also valid for the random parameter case."
"Figure 1 depicts two parallel roads, one \"fast\" and the other \"slow\", with a ramp on which vehicles from the slow roadway may be allowed to merge onto the fast road. Such a situation occurs frequently when a freeway or expressway is accompanied by a service road. It seems reasonable to restrict the ramp flow when an accident or congestion has caused a traffic jam downstream from the ramp. The traffic jam will then clear up more quickly, at the expense of inconvenience to a few vehicles which must continue travelling on the slow road instead of entering the fast road. This policy is especially valid if the fast road has more high priority vehicles, e.g., buses."
"The growing traffic congestion on national highways requires an increase in utilizing automarion in traffic control. One of the possibilities of improving the efficiency of controlling large stretches of highways is by using real-time computer control. Monitoring and sensing devices would be introduced and placed along a highway at selected places. One of the possible values to be measured is the cumulative count of vehicles at a certain place. This cumulative count should be recorded along with the appropriate real time. With this information on record, the flow rate and vehicle density at specific locations of the highway and at specific times, could be readily calculated. The data measured along the highway are transmitted to a central computer system and recorded in memory along with the appropriate times and places. The computations of flow rates, densities and other items that may be required, are performed by the same computer. A model representing the dynamics of the traffic flow will be adopted. Several possible models have already been proposed in the past. In the adopted model the vehicle flow rates, densities and velocities, will be connected by linearized difference equations which will serve as constraints in the optimization problems that will evolve. The equations representing the model (or several models available optionally) will be programmed and stored in the central computer. The equations will include the on- and off- ramp flow rates, which will constitute the control variables in many cases."
 "The process of bringing in and landing aircraft at the nation's larger airports is under great pressure to be improved. The capacity of a runway, measured in operations per hour, is a parameter of special interest, particularly when the demand exceeds that figure. The paper discusses an investigation of the performance of two alternative methods of controlling the flow of aircraft in a terminal approach area. The basis for the development of the control strategies and a discussion of their inherent characteristics are presented, and runway capacity and other important measures of performance are investigated."
 "Particular state variable representations are developed for the load frequency control of a linearized two-area interconnected power system. Associated cost functionals are developed emphasizing differences between the various state variable configurations. Comparison of the resulting modern optimal feedback controllers with the conventional are made."
"The control of a two area interconnected power system subjected to disturbance inputs is discussed from the viewpoint of optimal stochastic control theory."
"Urban congestion by unprecedented numbers of automobiles chokes human lungs and the traffic arteries. The financial plight of municipalities and the unwillingness of a substantial population segment to accept a voluntary lowering of opportunities deemed \"a few years\" prevent a strict engineering approach. The required political solution necessitates a stepwise approach with each phase improving present traffic patterns and leading to a suitable master system; simultaneously make the public reassess usage of private vehicles by inducements to make public transportation preferable. An outline employing a standard for step by step progress evaluation is provided."
"A precise definition of identifiability of a parameter is given in terms of consistency in probability for the parameter estimate. Under some mild uniformity assumptions on the conditional density parameterized by the unknown parameter, necessary and sufficient conditions for the unknown parameter to be identifiable are established. The assumptions and conditions are expressed in terms of the density of individual observations, conditioned upon all past observations. The results are applied to linear system identification problems."
"A method for system identification is proposed which is based on the error-correcting algorithm. This method is applicable to cases where the input sional is a sampled state space trajectory. In order to have a reasonable identification time we had to build in a waiting routine, and a ponderation of the input. Solutions for the problems of identification of non linear and non stationary plants are also proposed."
"Because the actual shape of a model's response may be more important than the value of an index such as the integral squared error, a probabilistic and empirical study has been made of parameter and state estimates that minimize the maximum error between plant and model outputs. Preliminary results indicate that minimax estimation compares favorably with estimations based upon a minimum squared error criterion. It is further shown that if the measurement noise is characterized by a distribution function which is continuous, symmetric and differentiable, then the estimate of the measurement will be unbiased."
"The problem considered is the order discrimination of a linear system with noisy observations. The order discrimination problem is viewed as a sequence of hypothesis tests; at the nth step, a choice is made between models of order n and (n+1). The sequence is terminated the first time that the lower order hypothesis is preferable. A series of detailed digital computer studies were performed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed order discrimination scheme."
"This paper presents a preliminary algorithm for determining the orders of a linear stochastic dynamic system solely from the observation of the system output. The scalar transfer function of the system contains both poles and zeros, however, no a priori information is available about the numbers and values of these poles and zeros. The driving input of this system is assumed to be white. Such a system is called a mixed type process, since it is a combination of the autoregressive (all-pole) and the moving-average (all zero) processes. The objective of this algorithm is thus to determine the number of poles (order of the autoregressive portion of the process) and the number of zeros (order of the moving-average portion of the process) of the mixed type process. The algorithm suggested in this paper is based on a two stage process: first take those output correlations which follow a repetitive pattern to determine the order of the autoregressive portion, then proceed to estimate the autoregressive parameters and lower the index of the correlation until the significant deviation from the repetitive pattern is observed, the order of the moving-average then can be determined."
"The problem presented in this paper is the identification of eleven parameter values of a 4th-order state equation used to model the incremental lateral dynamics of an aircraft subject to a step aileron deflection. The objective is to minimize the difference between the model's response and recorded inflight test data in a least squares sense. State sensitivity functions, which describe the variation in the model's state response for small, constant parameter perturbations, are used to develop an iterative solution to the identification problem. Results for three sets of initial parameter values show that the method rapidly converges to the same solution set."
"Identification of linear systems with unknown input gains and parameters by quasilinearization is studied both by the boundary value method and the performance index method. It is shown that the boundary value method requires a test signal whose order of complexity is proportional to the order of the system. On the other hand, with the performance index method, it is proved that the normal inputs to these systems are sufficient for complete system identification. This is significant because the most important consideration of system identification is to be able to identify the system under normal operation with as little disturbance to the system operation as possible."
"The paper deals with the first applications of a new congruent structure and parameters identification scheme for linear multivariable systems. The two typical results reported show the good applicability of the method to the identification of chemical reactors."
"This paper gives a brief survey of existing methods for identifying industrial processes, and examines in rather more detail the outstanding problem of identifying multivariable processes. A canonical form for multivariable parameter estimation is proposed."
"Suppose we have a time series that follows a p - th order autoregressive system and we aggregate it over m periods to obtain the non-overlapping aggregate sequence. First we ask what structure the aggregate sequence follows. Theorem 1 of Section 2 shows that the aggregate sequence follows an autoregressive system with a moving-average residual. In Section 3 we use the results of Theorem 1 to obtain the mean square errors of 4 predictors of the aggregate variable. They are (1) the optimal linear predictor using the disaggregate observations, (2) the optimal linear predictor using the aggregate observations, (3) the predictor obtained by the least squares regression on the p past aggregate variables, and (4) the predictor obtained by ignoring the residual part of the aggregate structure. Theorem 2 of Section 3 shows that the ratio of the mean square errors of any pair of the four predictors approaches 1 as m goes to infinity for a fixed p. The numerical evaluation of the mean square errors for the cases p = 1 and 2 show that the aggregate predictors, especially the optimal one, perform very well in comparison to the optimal disaggregate predictor. However, Section 4 shows that the estimates of the original parameters obtained from the aggregate data could be considerably inferior to those obtained from the disaggregate data."
"The problem of dynamic system identification is an important one to control engineers and statisticians. Much work has been done, from different starting points and with different perspectives and philosophies. One difficulty with this is that different nomenclature evolves in each field. For example, the engineering term \"system identification\" implies three more refined statistical ideas, namely identification (of the order of the model), estimation (of the parameters of the identified model) and diagnostic checking (of the fitted model to the data). In this paper, we consider only the problem of designing an input to a dynamic system in order to best estimate the parameters in the model, according to some design criterion."
  "We investigate a stochastic projected gradient algorithm, which can be used to find a constrained optimum point for a concave or convex objective function subject to nonlinear constraints which form a connected region, even when we do not have the objective function available, but only have a noisy estimate of the objective function. When the constraint consists of only one linear equation, we prove convergence to the constrained optimum value and bound the rate of convergence of the algorithm to the constrained optimum value. We then apply this algorithm to the nonlinear problem of automatically making an array of detectors form a beam in a desired direction in space when unknown interfering noise is present so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio subject to a constraint on the super-gain ratio."
"A system is proposed which combines hypothesis testing and prediction to estimate the future value of a stochastic process whose statistics are known only to belong to some finite set of possible hypotheses. Bayes optimization of the individual components is performed and system performance is discussed for a modified version of the usual mean-squared error predictor cost functions. An example is given illustrating various features of the system's performance for a specific choice of input hypotheses."
"Relations among four simultaneously orthogonal expansions (SOE), two of them previously known, are obtained. It is shown with the help of information theory that any of these SOE's can be derived from any other. The coefficients of the SOE's are employed to investigate the problem of choosing observables for discriminating two Gaussian signals under the probability of error criterion. The best single observable is found. It is also shown that the best n independent observables are not necessarily those having the smallest n individual error probabilities. The difficulties in picking the best observables are pointed out. As a byproduct, it is proved that even when the most important features of one signal are the least important of the other and vice versa; still, feature extraction and signal discrimination are not related in the sense that the best set for the former is not necessarily the best for the latter."
"This paper examines the use of various performance criteria for the design of processors in narrowband sensor array systems. These systems consist of an array of sensors (antennas, hydrophones, seismometers, etc.,) the outputs of which are combined in a processor to give an output which is optimal under the particular performance criteria of interest. Such systems allow the separation of a desired signal from a background of both directional and isotropic interference. For wide bandwidth signals these processors generally consist of linear filters, which for implementation purposes are approximated by tapped delay lines in each channel of the array. For the relatively narrowband problems being addressed by this paper (such as those concerned with jam resistant r-f radar and communications systems) these processors consist of complex weights in each channel (or in-phase and quadrature channels). Two types of arrays have proven useful in different applications. The conventional array as illustrated in Fig. 1 and the signal aligned array as shown in Fig. 2 where direction of arrival information is used to co-phase the desired signal in each channel."
"A primary reason that much attention has been given to array antenna systems is their ability to perform rapid inertialess scanning.[1][2] Despite this great interest in array processing,[3]-[6] the concept of an overall Bayesian approach to the scanning-detection problem has attracted little attention.[7] Classically \"beams\" are pointed at discrete spatial locations and detection decisions made on a local basis. Other suggested solutions include several non-parametric approaches[8]-[10] and a generalized likelihood ratio approach.[11]"
"Finite memory detector formulations have provided some insight into the role of receiver memory in signal detection problems[1]-[5]. One design uses a finite set of integers to characterize a µ state memory such that a sequentially operating transition rule involving observation thresholding can offer performance comparable to the optimal infinite memory detector. This generally suboptimal algorithm generates time varying observation thresholds offering a convergent probability of decision error for a rather large class of problems, including SKE, SKEA, and M-ary detection problems[5]. Conversely, it has been shown that time invariant transition rules generally offer a non-convergent decision error probability[1]. The essential contribution here is an analytical analysis of a simple time invariant finite memory detector. These results are compared to the time varying finite memory detector, and the optimal infinite memory detector."
"In the transfer of digital data through a linear, time-invariant channel, two major sources of distortion are present. These are additive Gaussian noise and intersymbol interference, whose effects are commonly measured by the probability of error in the data transfer. The contribution to the error rate by additive Gaussian noise is well known, but the contribution by intersymbol interference is still in general unknown. This paper considers the contribution to the probability of error by intersymbol interference through an investigation of upper bounds to the probability distribution function associated with this distortion. Previous endeavors in this area are discussed and improvements are demonstrated. Regions of improvement and examples are presented."
"This paper reports the results of an exploratory study conducted at Argonne National Laboratory in which atmospheric dispersion analysis was linked with modern control theory. Its initial objective was to introduce comprehensive air pollution episode control planning into the electric utility operations. The planning activity was based on the assumption that the ability of the utility plants to switch from coal fuel to natural gas could be utilized for air resource management purposes. This study resulted in the formulation of a computerized optimal episode control system for a subset of the power plant network. The control system, which inputs standard meteorological parameters and power demand forecasts, generates a schedule of power load shifting and natural gas utilization for the duration of a pollution episode. This optimal control schedule represents a minimum cost, minimum gas use strategy which restricts the pollution levels produced by power plants to a maximum acceptable threshold level within the limits of the real-time system operational and economic constraints and the capacity of the power plant network to react to control measures. The strategy can be updated as rapidly as altered meteorological conditions, a changing power demand schedule or unforeseen equipment failures warrant. An actual episode was used to test this control model. Recorded meteorological data and operating conditions supplied by the local Chicago utility were employed in the experiment. The control model was used to computer an optimal operating schedule. An indication of the air quality resulting from the use of this schedule was based on an atmospheric diffusion model."
"Simulation modeling will have a major role in air quality programs for forecasting, developing both temporary and long-range controls and planning regional land use. Such air quality models use pollutant emissions and meteorological measurements to simulate concentrations of atmospheric pollutants. Box-and Gaussian-type models have serious short comings, but the new generation models (such as NEXUS) are approaching an adequate resolution and accuracy for routine applications. The NEXUS model simulated pollutant concentrations within 20 percent of the observed values."
"Existing air pollution simulation models have not been validated with actual ambient air pollution data. The two major reasons for the lack of correlation between simulated and actual data are: 1) the physical system is far more complex than the model, and 2) available sensors are unreliable and inaccurate. A stochastic model is proposed in lieu of a deterministic model. The stochastic model is simple in structure and adaptive by nature, i.e., the parameters in the model are \"tracked\" by the data processing algorithm. A method to determine a priori parameter estimates is presented along with a method to \"track\" parameter changes and detect pollution violations statistically. Finally a method to optimally control the air quality in the regional area is discussed. The methodology proposed for use by APCDs in the 1970s has been extensively used by the defense and aerospace industry throughout the 1960s. There is every reason to believe that the methodology outlined in this paper for control of air quality in APCDs will become a \"standard\" for the 1970s."
"A new mathematical model for air pollution control in urban areas is proposed. Urban air pollution is the result of the accumlation of pollutant, caused by the transition of the wind fields. In the present paper, the feature of urban air pollution phenomena is discussed first. Secondly, a new model structure is proposed which treats the concentration of pollutant in the background separately from the whole pollutant. Finally, an example of numerical simulation based upon the proposed model is shown."
 "The optimal regulator of Distributed Parameter Systems with its cost functional involving time derivatives of distributed control vectors or state spatial and time derivative terms as well as the usual terms containing the control and state vectors has been analyzed by introducing augmented variables. A very significant result in modern control theory is that, for a linear, finite-dimensional, dynamical systems, the state feedback law derived from a quadratic performance index function minimization problem is linear. Generalization of the above result to a infinite-dimensional, distributed parameter dynamical systems with quadratic cost functional involving derivative terms is made possible from stability considerations. The state feedback law, realized by a linear distributed parameter dynamical system, has operator representations."
"The existence and uniqueness of optimal sampled-data controls are proved for parabolic distributed parameter systems with quadratic cost criteria. The feedback control laws are derived utilizing the necessary condition for a minimum in function space. The feedback operator is shown to be bounded, positive and self-adjoint, and the optimal cost is expressed in terms of the feedback operator."
"This paper considers the problem of optimal estimation of the states of a class of discrete distributed parameter systems subject to multiple time delays. The time delays are assumed to occur in both the system and the observation models. Algorithms are presented for obtaining estimates and the associated error variances sequentially."
"This paper discusses the mathematical description of propogation and growth of wave-type phenomena which may occur in many physical systems, such as, magnetohydrodynamic system, fluid flow system, electromagnetic field system. This work also discusses the statement of a maximum principle for this wave generating system. One dimensional version of this system with a quadratic cost function has been taken, and the method of gradients and quasilinearization techniques have been applied to derive the optimal control function."
 "In this paper a class of problems is considered where the observation matrix is a control variable. The cost function contains a quadratic form of the observation matrix in addition to the usual state and control terms. After the optimal plant control and state estimate have been determined, the resultant cost function is minimized with respect to the observation matrix."
"The continuous time nonlinear stochastic control problem is considered, and several implementable optimal control algorithms are discussed."
"The control of linear, time-varying systems with stochastic parameters is discussed. The optimal open loop control is derived and a computation scheme presented. A feedback control, based on the optimal open loop control, is discussed. This feedback control, the Open Loop Optimal Feed-back control, is shown to be a constant control for the autonomous infinite-time system."
"A Maximum Principle for systems influenced by time-invariant random parameters is established. An ordinary differential equation represents the system and the expectation of a cost functional is the performance index. The system is not necessarily linear and the cost not necessarily quadratic. The controls considered utilize some broadly defined \"information\" on the system. This information may consist of, but is not restricted to, instantaneous, noisy state measurements."
"In stochastic control of nonlinear systems, estimation and control are dependent-the control, in addition to its effect on the state of the system, affects the estimation performance. A method for obtaining a dual control sequence is discussed that leads to a one-step optimization problem and a control strategy called the one-step dual control. An example problem is used to indicate the performance improvement when using the one-step dual control instead of the separation control policy."
"A new approach for optimum control of discrete stochastic nonlinear systems is developed from practical engineering assumptions. Systems amenable to this new approach include optimum guidance and navigation systems for space and terrestrial vehicles, optimum closed-loop process controllers, and optimum controllers for systems with unknown parameters. The solution is obtained by expansion of the stochastic cost function in a power series around a deterministic trajectory with the assumption of linear perturbation estimation and control about that trajectory. Optimization of the expanded cost function gives necessary conditions dependent on the covariance matrices and the deterministic portion of the cost. When the necessary conditions are solved, a set of open-loop controls, perturbation controller gains, and perturbation estimator gains are obtained that can be precomputed and implemented into the system."
"An image data set of 54 scenes was obtained from 1/8\" by 1/8\" areas on a set of 1:20,000 scale photography. The scenes which consisted of 6 samples from each of the nine categories scrub, orchard, heavily wooded, urban, suburban, lake, swamp, marsh, and railroad yard was analyzed manually and automatically. For the automatic analysis, a set of features measuring the spatial dependence of the grey tones of neighboring resolution cells was defined. On the basis of these features and a simple decision rule which assumed that the features were independent and uniformly distributed on identification accuracy of 70% was achieved by training of 53 samples and assigning an identification to the 54th sample and repeating the experiment 54 times. This identification accuracy must be compared with the average 81% correct identification which five photointerpreters achieved with the same scenes, although the 81% correct identification is the accuracy achieved when they used the 9\" × 9\" photograph to interpret from. Note that the photograph is data of considerably higher resolution having much more context information on it than the small digitized 1/8\" × 1/8\" area the automatic analysis had available."

"Stability is difficult to maintain under the three- phase-fault-breaker-failure criterion with a plant of two nominal 800 MW units connected radially by two 500 kV lines to a 230 kV load network. This paper describes the application of dynamic stability aids such as: fast-valving, 500 kV breakers with independently operated poles, fast-excitation, and alternate 500 kV line arrangements, and investigates machine internal losses during the fault, alternative fault types and locations, and the setting of the load unbalance relays. The costs of the alternative stability aids are compared and a choice of load unbalance relay settings for initiating fast-valving is made to obtain stability at a minimum cost with fast-valving and 500 kV breakers having independently operated poles."
"Dynamic stability analysis of a large interconnected power system is extremely time consuming and laborious and may even exceed the storage capacity of modem fast computers because of the high order of the A matrix. Hence methods have been developed here to obtain simplified models of the systems based on the speed of response of the variables or the modes."
"The direct method of Lyapunov applied to the problem of transient power system stability is developed to permit the practical study of n-machine systems. A simple physical interpretation and a proof are given for two Lyapunov functions. A new and better Lyapunov function is defined, and several possibilities for its evaluation are studied. Through an analysis of the singular points of the system the causes of the conservativeness of the results are established, and a further improvement on the Lyapunov function is made. A general structure for a computer program is proposed, and results of an example with a 10-machine system solved by the conventional and the new methods are presented; the computing time by the Lyapunov method was about 40-percent shorter. Finally, several ideas for a further generalization and optimization of the method and a possibility for the design and control of power systems are proposed."
"This paper presents a method of modeling the ties and lines in a power pool for use in dispatch, pool costing, and security- related functions. External pool ties, as well as ties and lines, within the pool are modeled. The networks of all pool members as well as those external to the pool are incorporated in the model. The model consists of a matrix whose rows represent ties and lines and whose columns represent generators, loads if explicitly represented, and net interchanges. Both current and power models are given. The current model yields tie currents when postmultiplied by a current vector and the power model yields tie powers when postmultiplied by a power vector. The model allows loads to be treated explicitly, as mentioned above or implicitly, where the load currents or powers are not required for tie flow determinations. Lines within the areas of the pool are included under the tie designation. Off-nominal autotransformers and phase shifters, which represent a difficult case, are rigorously considered."
"This paper describes a method for the automatic optimized sectionalization of power transmission networks as required for the application of piecewise solution techniques. The optimality criterion is the minimization of the total computer core memory requirement for storage of the network impedance or admittance matrices."
"Use of capacitor banks for voltage correction has been common practice in electric utilities for many years. Selecting the location and size of such banks for large, interconnected systems is a complicated problem because many combinations are possible. This paper presents a method based on linear models, discrete variable and selective iteration techniques that determines the minimum most efficient combination of location and amount of static capacitors to bring the voltage level of each bus in the system above a specified minimum."
"The on-line economic dispatch of electric power systems is usually accomplished by use of loss formulas employing B coefficients. This paper shows how Kron's B coefficients can be calculated by Tinney's optimally ordered direct solution techniques which exploit the sparsity of the network admittance matrix. The new technique is much faster, more accurate, and more reliable than currently used iterative techniques. In addition, it rigorously handles systems with phase shifters and static elements to ground with no difficulty. Precise timing of sample system experiments (5 to 160 nodes) documents the greatly improved solution efficiency."
"Power system major transmission requirements and their associated costs are considerably influenced by the location of the future generating capacity. The object of major transmission planning is to select the most desirable transmission network for each of the generation expansion patterns under consideration. Both economics and reliability considerations are considered in the appraisal of the most desirable transmission network. The application of a digital computer to automated transmission planning allows the system planner to investigate many alternatives with much less effort than by manual means. The ultimate selection of the generation expansion plan is then made by considering the transmission as an integral part of the total cost."
"The overall objective of this sequence of papers [1]-[4] is to present the development of a single technique that simultaneously calculates several widely used indices of power system reliability. The sequence has already discussed generation and load models, indices of reliability used for generation planning, and models to represent multiple boiler-multiple turbine units and partial capacity outages. This part brings up for examination what the authors believe to be some of the more relevant generation planning problems. The paper presents methods for recognizing the effects of delays in unit installations and for implementing the various techniques for handling the calculation of frequency indices for two interconnected systems. Computer programs and numerical examples of the methods presented are also discussed."
"This paper obtains a new accurate model for sensitivity in power systems and uses it in conjunction with linear programming for the solution of load-shedding problems with a minimum loss of loads. For cases where the error in the sensitivity model increases, other linear programming and quadratic programming models have been developed, assuming currents at load buses as variables and not load powers. A weighted error criterion has been used to take priority schedule into account; it can be either a linear or a quadratic function of the errors, and depending upon the function appropriate programming techniques are to be employed."
"Multistep integration algorithms suitable for transient stability studies are developed by combining conventional, implicit multistep formulas with new iterative procedures. A simple power system example is used to compare the performance of the multistep algorithms to that of a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The results of this preliminary experimental investigation indicate that for comparable accuracy, the multistep algorithms require significantly less computing effort."
"In recent years, Newton's method has been generally accepted as a superior algorithm for solving power flow problems. But the introduction of generator var limits, area-interchange control, load-tap- changing (LTC) transformers, and variable phase shifting transformers has significantly increased the solution times (compared with a fixed system). This paper shows how LTC transformers and variable phase-shifting transformers may be automatically adjusted by the Newton algorithm, thus complementing a previous inclusion of the area interchange control variables within the Newton algorithm [1]. Tests of the new method for adjusting LTC transformers and phase shifters indicate a significant overall saving in solution time."
"The standard approach to inclusion of a new feature or capability into a load flow program has been to modify whatever numerical algorithm was being used for solution. Usually, the efficiency of the algorithm suffered in the process. This paper develops a procedure for modifying the equations which model a load flow while retaining the same basic (Newton's Method) algorithm; this results in a program of increased power and efficiency."
"Further modifications of Newton's method as applied to the solution of load-flow problems are described. Considerable saving in computer time is achieved when using these methods. The algorithms proposed can be adapted to the case when main storage space is limited by using backing magnetic tape storage."
"A fast and reliable method for solving the load flow problem in electrical power systems is presented. It is called the voltage vectors method. The main feature of the method is its ability to solve the load flow problem very quickly, faster than any present method. Rapid and reliable convergence is its other important feature."
"This paper addresses the problem of establishing maximum levels within the capability of contemporary microwave-carrier equipment to operate with all channels fully loaded with continuous tones. A review of the problem, tutorial information and primary information are presented. The conclusions with recommended tone level tables to provide optimum loading of a microwave system will be useful to all microwave users having data channel requirements."
"This paper deals with the problems arising during laboratory investigations of the corona behavior of HVDC overhead line components. In this connection the results of dc RIV and visual corona tests performed on smooth and stranded conductors and on disk insulator units and strings at voltages up to 1200 kV are presented. Finally, some remarks are made on the most suitable procedures to be adopted for these tests."
"A new analytical method is described for computing the maximum field intensity at the surface of any smooth conductor of a multiconductor system forming a regular polygon. In this method, each conductor in the system is replaced by a line charge at its center equal to the charge on its surface plus a system of line dipoles to account for the proximity effect. The line dipoles in the conductor under consideration are treated as individual line charges. The degree of accuracy of the method, for the two-conductor case, is checked against the known exact solution. It is shown that this method is very accurate even for small conductor spacing to diameter ratios (less than 6), where existing analytical methods become very inaccurate."
"A mathematical expression is developed for determining the maximum voltage gradient on any conductor of a split-bundle conductor configuration. This expression is then applied to calculate the maximum voltage gradient of certain hypothetical configurations. The results show that for a constant cross-sectional area per phase, by splitting a conductor of an N-conductor bundle into p subconductors, thus forming an N X p-conductor split bundle, the maximum voltage gradient can be reduced, but not as much as if the N X p- conductor split bundle is converted into an (N X p)-conductor bundle."
"The calculation of gradients for the center phase of a three-phase line in flat arrangement is discussed. A simple way is shown to calculate gradients with a very fair accuracy and without the use of a computer. An even faster way to proceed using an extremely short computer program is also described. The method applies to bundles with any number of subconductors."
"A method for calculating the shapes of positive and negative corona pulses, their amplitudes and repetition rates is presented. The calculated positive corona pulse has an almost double exponential shape, while the negative pulse is considerably steeper and shorter in duration."
"The Waltz Mill test facility is part of the Electric Research Council's program for research on underground transmission. At this station prototype samples can be tested at voltages ranging from 115 kV to 1 100 kV. The station was designed to provide flexibility and control of accelerated life tests of sample insulation systems and other evaluations required to demonstrate serviceability of prototype transmission systems. Initial samples being tested are 500-kV paper insulated, pipe-type cables. Test loops are not underground, but are installed above ground. Artificial earth environment is provided by computer controlled heaters and thermal lagging on the test pipes. Up to 2000 amperes can be circulated in the conductor of each sample to simulate loading conditions. Computer logging of temperature data and other quantities plus power factor measurements provide a history of sample performance during the two year test period. Test sample installation procedures are described."

"The design concept of the G & W 500 kV capacitor graded potheads supplied for the E. R. C.-Waltz Mill field testing program is basically the same as those supplied for a similar field testing program to evaluate 345 kV cable systems."
 "This paper describes the design, manufacture and tests on a 500/550 kV cable and joint. The cable successfully withstood 1550 kV impulse and 1290 kV switching surge established by Electric Research Council for the Waltz Mill field tests. The 60 Hz tests demonstrated the cable with either a splice, insulated to 2 times the insulation O.D. or 1.5 times the insulation O.D. had adequate ac dielectric strength."
"A 550 Kv. paper insulated pipe cable is on test. Maximum stress is 425 v/mil (17 kv/cm). A semi-synthetic taped joint operates at 315 v/mil and dissipation factor about 40% lower than the cable. A telemetered temperature monitoring system gives a direct reading of average conductor temperature. Design and manufacturing details are given."
"Background for development of EHV underground transmission is traced, introducing pertinent details of one manufacturer's research and development on 500 kV pipe cable. Highlights of cable design and manufacture are summarized. The continuing search by the industry for a synthetic alternate to oil-paper insulation is discussed in relation to future cable designs. Advantages of forced cooling for EHV underground transmission systems are recognized."
"This paper covers General Cable Corporation's development and testing of a 500 KV high pressure pipe type oil filled cable. It also covers the installation of a sample length of this cable at the Edison Electric Institute test site at Waltz Mill, Pennsylvania."
"Induced control circuit transients from energizing the first 230-kV shunt capacitor banks at Pinnacle Peak Substation damaged solid-state devices, caused flashovers at terminal blocks and initiated false supervisory control indications. Simulated, reduced voltage and full voltage switching of 230-kV capacitors were performed to explore the transient problem. The nature of the transient, its transfer mechanism to control circuits, how to reduce it at the source, and how to improve immunity of control circuits to the transient were studied. Simulation tests used actual power circuits in an inservice substation, which were impulsed at 20 kV. Reduced voltage tests were made on an isolated system at 30-50% voltage. Full voltage tests were made on a 230-kV interconnected system. Plastic-jacketed and lead- sheathed control cables and copper-braid- shielded coaxial cable specimens in a variety of grounding and shielding techniques were tested. Radio frequency, electromagnetic and electrostatic components of control circuit transients were measured separately. Transients up to 7,500 volts on unshielded cables were indicated, and frequencies-from 6-80 kHz and 0.4-7 MHz were recorded. Power circuit lumped parameter oscillations and distributed parameter propagation and reflection-type transient components were observed. Unshielded control cables were protected by grounding spare conductors and aluminum trench covers, paralleling two No. 4/0 bare ground cables, and installing 0.1 ୟ bypass capacitors. Switches with 160Ω resistors per phase were used to suppress transients at the source. With these measures, control circuit transients were reduced to 65 volts for energizing 230-kV capacitors on an interconnected system."
"The paper presents the results of measurements on the characteristics of high frequency transient voltages on power station wiring. The characteristics described are the amplitude, frequency, impedance, coupling properties and rate of occurrence. The control measures investigated include the use of shielded cables, relocation of wiring grounds and use of surge diverting capacitors."
"The paper proposes a method of distance-type protection suitable for on-line digital computer protection of transmission lines. The basic principle is the predictive calculation of peak fault current and voltage from a small number of sample values. The magnitudes of various sources of error are discussed. The results of experimental work on a model transmission line and on a high- voltage transmission system are described. The calculation times for implementation in real time are estimated."
"General steady-state equivalent circuits are derived for the family of single-phase motors with unequal contrarotating magnetic fields produced by one or two stator windings and/or stator saliency, and rotor torque due to hysteresis and/or eddy- current action. The derivation of an equivalent quadrature motor, first shown by Kron, is extended to the range of motors under consideration. The idealized treatment in the paper permits hysteresis to be included in the linear analysis of single-phase motors."
"In this paper the series motor is looked upon as a servomotor and a simple efficient method of predicting its transient behavior is presented. The motor is assumed to be controlled by means of thyristors. A closed-loop block diagram depicting the transient behavior of the series motor is evolved using perturbation techniques. The transient response for small sudden variations of load torque or of firing angle is deduced. The results are coimpared with those obtained from a computer by numerically solving the nonlinear differential equations of the series motor. It is shown that the block diagram approach gives good results and is much simpler than the numerical method."
"Equations for the self-inductances Ld and La of a reluctance machine having flux barriers and cutouts are developed. An electromagnetic model of the reluctance machine is postulated. Flux densities are found in the air gap proper, the cutouts, and the barriers. A comparison is made between measured and calculated results."
"Polyphase reluctance machine performance is analyzed by direct-and quadrature-axis components, by circle diagrams, and by machine admittance. Specific equations are deduced for pull-out out torque, maximum power factor, no-load current, and pull-out current. A method is given by which the entire motor performance may be calculated through knowledge of machine admittance. Comparisons are made between calculated and measured results."
"This paper describes a new measurement system for the calibration of current transformers at 60 Hz for all ratios up to 10000/5 and higher and at four times rated current. For ratios up to 1200/5, no reference transformer is needed and the system is accurate to five parts per million (ppm). Most higher ratios can be measured using only one reference transformer. Included is an example of how a laboratory could use such a system to measure all ratios up to 8000/5, requiring a calibration of only one reference transformer on one ratio (4000/5)."
"Mathematical equations are developed for the torque on the disk of a watthour meter as a function of applied voltage, load current, and power factor angle. The torque equations are developed from two air-gap fluxes on the basis of the Ferraris or split-phase principle."
"A solid state device using sampling techniques is described for measurement of power system quantities such as power, reactive power, voltamperes and power factor. An output voltage linearly proportional to the above quantities is provided for continuous control and recording purposes. The speed of response is less than one cycle."
"Purchase specifications for switch-gear for nuclear powered generator stations require some level of earthquake survival demonstration. There being no established standard for such a demonstration, it was considered necessary to develop and conduct a testing program which gave assurance of compliance with both structural and electrical operating needs."
"Conventional contact materials cannot simultaneously meet three of the most critical functional requirements of the high capacity vacuum interrupter. This paper describes the development of a new class of vacuum interrupter contact alloys which offer exceptional properties combining high interrupting capability, high dielectric strength, and anti-welding. The mechanism by which anti-welding is achieved is described and substantiated by test results."
"High speed photographic techniques for studying the motion of the arc and arc products in air-magnetic circuit breakers and methods for measuring the chute wall temperature and post arc electrical conductivity are discussed. The information revealed by these experiments has broadened and deepened understanding of the fundamental process of interruption in such breakers. It is also most helpful in evaluating practical design changes."
"The Working Group on Lightning Arrester Contamination Performance and Durability of the Overvoltage Protective Devices Subcommittee of the IEEE Surge Protective Devices Committee has prepared a final report summarizing the replies to a questionnaire on arrester serviceability under contaminated conditions. The questionnaire was distributed in 1966 by members of the working group to electric utility companies throughout the United States. An evaluation of the responses is presented in this paper, and several significant observations are made and conclusions reached. A variety of contaminants which might affect arresters is described in addition to the extent to which preventative practices and procedures are utilized to minimize the effects of contamination on arresters. A distinction is made between station or intermediate class arresters and distribution class arresters concerning the possible processes contributing to failure from contamination."

"This paper examines railroad electrification from the viewpoints of competitive position, load characteristic, service requirements and facility design. Summaries of foreign developments, railroad benefits, and railroad problems associated with electrified operation are presented. Potential electrified railway load magnitudes and characteristics are considered from individual system and national standpoints. Service techniques are recommended which will insure satisfactory operating performance from both utility and railroad standpoints. Possible characteristics for railroad substations, switching, and overhead power delivery facilities are presented. There are no insurmountable technical problems associated with servicing anticipated railway loads, and the electric locomotive's many benefits make it a strong competitor for moving tomorrow's trains."
"This paper discusses the role of corporate models in the planning of the growth and operation of electric utilities. This new tool is a major addition to the methods available to the engineer, financial analyst and business manager to use in the investigation of alternate courses of action for strategic planning, tactical planning and situations involving operational planning and control problems. These models include consideration of the forecasts of the expected company growth in terms of requirements for new service, load growth in existing customer groups, requirements for system expansion, operating expenses and revenues, and the resultant interval cash flows and requirements for new external funds. These models produce forecasts of financial reports, requirements for external financing and any specialized reports desired. They include a representation of the accounting system as well as the business and production sectors. This paper illustrates how these models may be used to supplement, not supplant, the usual engineering economy study and compares results produced by model studies and a revenue requirements analysis. In addition, a discussion is given of areas, such as lease financing, which are difficult to handle with the usual engineering economy approach but which model can accommodate. Finally, the paper offers suggestions concerning the steps required to develop and use corporate models within the electric utility."
"Most equivalent circuit models for synchronous machines have either neglected saturation or used only one saturable reactance which was made a function of one or more machine variables. The approach of this paper is, first, to determine the regions of magnetic saturation and to identify the magnetic flux variable on which each depends. Analytical models are then developed in which each saturable region of the machine is represented by a nonlinear parameter, the value of which is dependent on only one node voltage."
"The present work is a continuation of a study presented by one of the authors at the 1969 IEEE Winter Power Meeting in New York, N. Y. In that part of the paper the MMF and air gap magnetic field space variations, and the phase current time variations of a salient pole synchronous machine in asynchronous operation were analyzed. Here, the MMF and magnetic field angular velocity, as well as the power and torque as a function of slip, are considered."
"A method of quenching transient oscillations of a generator feeding a load over long lines was implemented in the laboratory. A disturbance that caused instability was repeated with this control, and the system remained stable."
"A new technique to obtain reliable and noise free signals proportional to the acceleration and to the deviation of the rotor angular velocity of a generator from the system synchronous angular velocity was implemented and tested. The signals thus obtained had considerably higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to the signals derived from a conventional tachometer (about 30 to 50 dB improvement) with the same bandwidth."
"Excitation control by stabilizing signal taken from several locations in the system, together with the proper transfer function, has been investigated to satisfy the system stability from an overall performance view point, rather than one machine against an infinite bus. Several stabilizing signals have been tried from which the following signals have been found to have a great affect in increasing the damping: (1) a signal from the change of network voltage and taken from the far end, and (2) a signal from the change in the machine terminal frequency through a compensating network having a transfer function containing three zeros and three poles. The location of such signals greatly effects the system stability, and it is found that the signal taken from the change of frequency at a remote point of the network and applied to the voltage regulator of the machine under consideration has more effect in stabilizing the system. The station working with a leading power factor makes the stability rather critical, and stabilizing such stations greatly improves the system stability."
"In a power system, generators can oscillate following faults or line switching in the system. To reduce the size of these oscillations is highly desirable."
"The nonlinear quasi-Poisson equation that describes static magnetic fields in saturable iron is solved approximately by minimizing the corresponding nonlinear energy functional. The minimization is performed by means of the method of finite elements, using firstorder elements and a quadratically convergent iterative solution method. The method is applied to a turboalternator and used to predict all the normal shop-floor test results. Excellent agreement is found between experimental and computed values. Computing times are found to be extremely fast, and it is concluded that this method is capable of producing results comparable to those obtained by finite difference methods, but at very much reduced cost."
"The rapid increase in electric and magnetic loadings of electrical machines demands improved methods of predicting the end zone field distribution. This paper presents a numerical method for the determination of end zone fields and for the calculation of end-leakage reactance of high-speed alternators. The method takes account of all boundaries, simplified in regard to their geometries and magnetic nature. As a first step, the partial differential equations of the electromagnetic field in the different regions of the end-winding region of homopolar alternators are developed, based on the concept of the magnetic vector potential. These are transformed into finite difference equations, which are retained in a general form allowing for the nonlinearities of iron and the effect of current carrying regions. The theory of the energy method to evaluate the end-leakage reactance is explained. The difficulties of a numerical solution in three dimensions are presented. Then a mathematical model is set up taking the discrete nature of the windings into account. This model makes possible adequate consideration of the effects of the surrounding boundaries and also the effects of the air gap, slots, and of the short-pitched armature winding. An orthogonal lattice system is then fitted to the model. The boundary conditions in differential and difference forms are developed in terms of the magnetic vector potential. An iterative procedure consisting of successive point relaxation of the vector potentials is described."
"An effective new method of detecting interturn short circuits on round rotor windings is described. The approach used is to measure the rate of change of the air-gap flux density wave when the rotor is at operating speed and excitation is applied to the field winding. The measurements are obtained by the use of a small stationary search coil positioned near the rotor surface. The voltage outputs are recorded by Polaroid pictures from an oscilloscope screen and can be analyzed based on the information presented. The sensitivity obtained from these methods is far superior to previous methods. The data obtained at operating speed identify the coils and slots which have shorted turns, and provide a good indication of the number of turns shorted in a coil if more than one short exists."
"Equations of performance of the shaded pole motor are written in terms of the two actual stator circuits and two equivalent rotor circuits for the squirrel cage. Transient performance under locked rotor and dynamic starting conditions is obtained by numerically solving the differential equations of performance. The equations are also used to obtain the steady state performance of the motor. Comparison is also made with results obtained from two other well known methods. An experimental method of determining the various constants is discussed with an illustrative example."
"A great deal has already been published about change-speed squirrel-cage induction motors using the principle of pole-amplitude modulation (P.A.M.), but it was doubtful, in the earlier stages, whether the same techniques could be applied to slip-ring machines; and whether, even if they could, there would be many useful applications. In fact, it has now been found that the latest P.A.M. designs are applicable to slip-ring machines, and a number of large slip-ring P.A.M. motors are already in service. This paper discusses those special features of slip-ring P.A.M. motors which are not possessed by squirrel-cage P.A.M. motors, and also some of the ways in which these machines can be applied."
"Speed changing of induction motors fed from a variable frequency source is studied with a view to minimization of speed transition time. Step as well as linear changes in supply frequency are considered. Expressions for optimum rates of (linear) change of frequency have been obtained analytically and confirmed by model studies. The results apply primarily for large changes in speed."
"This paper describes a closed-loop control system for an ordinary wound-rotor induction motor, which makes use of thyristors on the secondary side as phase-controlled ac switches operating at slip-frequency. It is shown that such phase-controlled thyristors allow the torque of the machine to be varied from zero to values bounded by the normal torque/speed characteristic of the basic motor, and when overall speed control is applied the motor can be given shunt-type torque/speed characteristics."
"The application of thyristor switching to induction motor speed control has resulted in a number of unconventional supply systems. One such technique, which has been successfully employed in a number of applications, is variable voltage control by means of symmetrically triggered thyristors in the stator phases of a wye-connected machine. In this paper, an analytic method for predicting the steady-state performance of such a system is presented. The solution is obtained in closed form without the necessity for iteration to obtain the proper boundary conditions. In addition, it is shown that the symmetry of the solution permits an additional reduction in the computation time. Since matrix techniques are utilized throughout the analysis, the equations can be easily implemented into a digital computer program. Hence, the method is well suited to the evaluation of proposed motor designs when used in conjunction with thyristor voltage control. Measured torque-speed characteristics of a typical drive system are included and the results compared to an analytical solution. It is demonstrated that a computed solution will favorably predict the performance of an actual system."
"A variable speed electric drive system has been developed in which the speed-torque characteristics of a dc series motor have been attained without the need for a commutator. Improved utilization of active material has been achieved by using series-connected polyphase ac windings on both the rotor and the stator of the rotating machine and by maintaining a favorable torque angle relationship between the rotor and stator MMF waves. Torque angle is controlled by means of a shaft coupled transducer which controls the firing of silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's) in a variable frequency inverter or cycloconverter type of ac power supply."
"In this paper a method is given to simulate electric machines on analog or digital computers. The windings in both axes of a generalized electric machine, considered as n coupled windings, are first transformed into Pi-equivalents, whose components are closely related to the actual magnetic circuits. The motional electromotive forces being then included, it is possible to draw a signal flow-graph which represents the machine to be simulated. This signal flow-graph leads directly to computer set-ups without differentiators. Also, the technique described in this paper is especially useful when using digital programs since the signal flow-graph does not contain any algebraic loop. It can therefore be used to write a digital program using any available simulation language."
"This paper presents an analytical treatment to compute the torque-speed curve of a dc excited electromagnetic coupling considering magnetic saturation. The complete nonlinear magnetization curve is mathematically represented and the maximum torque is accurately predicted. The above approach being a generalized one can be applied to any electromagnetic apparatus working under saturation condition. The present coupling can also be used as a variable speed drive."
"In this paper Maxwell's field theory has been successfully applied to analyze the behaviour of dc excited electromagnetic couplings having solid iron in the secondary. New approaches have been developed to consider the saturation effect by the linear permeability μe, and the finite length effect by the end-effect factor Ke. A smooth variable speed drive that is quite competitive in many ways with the existing ones is also suggested."
"A discussion of the losses caused by skewing of a rotor with uninsulated bars is presented, giving full consideration to the distributed nature of the rotor parameters. At first, tooth pulsation and surface losses are reviewed briefly. Then an approximate method of calculation of losses due to iron cross currents in the rotor is presented and shown to yield experimentally acceptable results. The equations for the latter losses are relatively simple and the effect of parameter variations can be studied. The losses in the bars are shown to be inversely proportional to the square of the differential leakage coefficient of the rotor; the surface losses in the iron are a function of the resistance between adjacent bars of the squirrel cage and are inversely proportional to the first power of the differential leakage coefficient."
"An improved method is described for determining, by digital computation, the waveshape of air gap flux density in polyphase induction motors operating under saturated conditions."
"The problem of optimization of induction motor design is tackled as a nonlinear programming problem. The objective function or the cost function is formed taking only the material cost into account. The specifications like pull out torque, starting torque etc. are put as constraint functions. These functions are expressed in terms of important dimensions of the machine which are assumed to be continuously variable. The sequential unconstrained minimization technique for nonlinear programming is used to obtain an optimum design. Analysis and synthesis programs needed for the problem have also been developed. The method is applied to a line of small single cage integral horsepower motors."
"The self-excitation of polyphase induction motors having stator circuit shunt capacitors is reviewed in this paper. The criterion for self-excitation of a coasting motor and capacitor combination, which has been disconnected from the line, is derived by a dynamic analysis using d-and q-axis variables. The criterion has been confirmed by analog simulation. Also reported are studies of a novel method, employing motor self-excitation, for starting squirrel cage motors. The method may have application where it is important to minimize the system voltage dips that accompany motor starting."
"Short-circuit tests have shown that, under conditions of maximum asymmetry, three-phase short circuits near generator terminals may have one or possibly two phases in which the current does not reach zero for several cycles. Particularly in the application of high- speed high-voltage circuit breakers, there could be a serious question that this phenomenon might prevent normal circuit opening of such circuit breakers, with possible damage to the circuit breaker and the system. This investigation was undertaken to develop a method for calculating such conditions that would agree with the tests and could be used for examining future applications. The method developed takes into account that non-simultaneous closure of the three phases can substantially extend the time to reach current zero, and produced good agreement with the tests previously made. When applied to a major generating station addition now under construction, it was found that an improbable but possible sequence of phase closures could produce a continuing short circuit where one phase did not reach zero for about eleven cycles. However, when the phases which did reach zero were allowed to open at their normal opening times for a 2-cycle circuit breaker, the third phase reached zero in three to four cycles."
"Tooth-ripple losses in the rotor poles of a synchronous machine can be measured directly by measuring an alternative Poynting vector, in the rotor reference frame, from the electric and magnetic fields in the air gap of the machine. The total field in the air gap can be analyzed into a number of travelling waves. The induced effects due to each wave are observed at a different frequency in the rotor. This enables the measurement of the power loss due to each individual harmonic in an actual machine while all the harmonics are simultaneously present."
"The paper presents the experimental results of power flow measurements in the air gap of a salient-pole synchronous machine at no-load in the rotor reference frame. The essence of this new method is the measurement of an alternative Poynting vector from the electric and magnetic fields in the air gap of the machine. Suitable probes for measuring these field components are briefly described, together with the associated circuits."
"This paper describes the design, fabrication, and testing of a two-pole, 3600 r/min, three-phase, 80 kVA alternator with a rotating, super-conducting field winding and an air-cooled copper armature. The major contribution is the experimental proof that liquid helium can be used in a rotating dewar vessel to successfully cool a rotating, superconducting field winding."
"In this paper, past experience and present knowledge are used to speculate on the applicability of superconductors in the field windings of large synchronous machines. The prospects look quite attractive for 3600 r/min and 1800 r/min turbine generators in the range of ratings from 1000-10,000 MVA. The prospects are also bright for synchronous condensers and peaking generators provided refrigeration can be supplied in an economical manner."
"Circuit breakers in this decade will have to satisfy demands, not only for increased ratings but also for reliability, ability to function under multiple contingency situations, reduced environmental pollution, versatility of application, and reduced installation and maintenance costs. The system requirements which new circuit breakers need to meet in order to satisfy these new demands are given. A new line of circuit breakers that satisfies these demands is described. The paper introduces a set of accompanying papers that describe the interrupting, insulating and mechanical systems of this new breaker line in detail."
"The basic interrupting system of the new breaker line is of the modular concept. It utilizes the double pressure SF6 interruption technique which has been in service for over a decade, with the inovation of a downstream blast valve. This basic interrupting module can be utilized in various arrangements to allow ratings of 115 kV, 5000 MVA to 345 kV, 25000 MVA. This paper and its companion papersl, 2,7 will discuss the goals of performance, the method of operation and the results of the verification program for this interrupter."
"A new line of SF6 circuit breakers has been developed that is neither strictly live or dead tank. Consequently, unusual insulation problems were faced by the designers. These insulation problems and their solutions are discussed. The insulating systems for the entire line of breakers are described under three broad headings: SF6 gas, solid insulation and air."
"The mechanical system of the breaker is taken to include internal mechanisms, external structure, and packaging. Goals are listed for the mechanical system. The design, construction, and operation of the important features of the internal mechanisms are discussed. The framework and packaging is discussed with special attention given to ease of shipping, installation and maintenance and to attractive appearance."
"The use of a capacitor to modify the line-side component of transient recovery voltage following a short-line fault is investigated. A method is presented based on traveling wave theory to show the modifying influence of capacitance. Empirical data is included to show the effect of the capacitance on interrupting capability. The effects of size, location, and the possibility of using carrier components are discussed."
"Experimental and statistical evidence is given which concludes that the great majority of practical circuit breakers derive considerable benefit from redundancy of three pole operation on a three phase system. The value of the standard deviation can be much more important than that of the voltage interrupted by the first phase to clear. For the same probability of failure, the poles in a \"good\" three phase circuit breaker can function reliably at more than 60% higher voltage than they can when acting alone (see Table XI)."
"The dependability of the digital calculation accuracies of switching surges is proven through several comparative studies with the field test results. It is also clarified that the resistor preinsertion closing of a circuit breaker is one of the most effective methods for reduction of switching surges. On the other hand, in factory tests, satisfactory results have been obtained on the withstand characteristics and the coordination between the across-the-open-pole insulation and the phase-to-ground of an EHV air blast circuit breaker against switching surges."
"A circuit condition has been identified that can cause interruption difficulties for 15 kV air-magnetic circuit breakers. The interaction between the system and the circuit breaker has been studied by field and laboratory tests. A solution to the problem, which assures reliable performance of the equipment, has been developed and extensively tested."
 "A power system stabilizer specifically designed to the performance specifications of various utilities in the Western United States has been developed. The stabilizer utilizes synchronous machine terminal frequency as input. With this input signal, the stabilizing signal is derived using all static components and susceptibility to electrical noise is reduced. The design is modular with the sensing and signal conditioning elements implemented with all solid-state circuitry contained on draw-out printed circuit card assemblies. The design provides independent adjustment of gain and time constants with calibrated controls to allow direct settings from calculated data. Factory tests on the prototype verified its dynamic characteristics met or exceeded performance specifications. Field tests on a 422 MVA unit demonstrated improved damping of oscillations following switching of a tie line."
"The alinement of speed excitation supplementary control for each of the two Hanford 430 MW nuclear steam turbine-generator units was readily accomplished through field testing. Off-line frequency response tests of the supplementary control units, voltage regulators and exciters and frequency and step response test of the excitation system provided data used to develop a dynamic simulation model of the Hanford units. The information will aid computer studies of dynamic performance."
"This paper stresses the unique and complex electrical auxiliary system associated with the handling of coal in slurry form delivered by pipeline."
"This paper reviews the current design criteria and their application to the auxiliary power system of a large nuclear unit. The paper includes a description of the systems, equipment ratings, and discusses some of the considerations which influenced the design."
"The paper describes a digital computer programme for the protection of a three-phase transmission line. This programme detects the presence of a disturbance, classifies the fault into one of six fault types and, using a method of impedance calculation described in an earlier paper, determines the modulus and phase of the impedance of the faulted line. Accuracy of calculation and reliability of detection are determined from fault data for a model transmission line."
"Data are presented to supplement and update the original paper in line with currently used fault recording equipment and practices. Features are described together with some typical applications of the new equipment."
"Insulator crossarms for 345-kv EHV transmission line have been developed and tested. They use four solid-core post insulator columns (quadruped type) or two solid-core post insulator columns and two disc insulator strings (Twin-arm type) to form a tetrapod mounted horizontally from the tower. They are characterized by making possible narrower right-of-way, more compact tower dimension, and supporting higher mechanical load."
"A study is made of the steady-state short circuit current Is.c., and open circuit voltage, Vo.c., to ground for conducting objects under E.H.V. transmission lines. This is carried out in a computer program and on a scaled down laboratory model of a transmission line. In addition, tests are conducted at the American Electric Power Service Corporation and Westinghouse Electric Corporation E.H.V. test site at Apple Grove, West Virginia[1]. The Apple Grove results are used for comparison with the other two approaches. Values of Is.c. within a few percent of the field data and of Vo.c. within about 30 percent are predicted by the computer program. For the transmission line model, the measured values of Is.c. are within a few percent of the Apple Grove measurements and the values of Vo.c. are within approximately 15 percent."
"In this present paper, we examine the research work which has been carried out on polyethylene, laboratory tests and the experience acquired with high and very high voltage cables in service in the French network. The use of polyethylene for cables is under study in a number of countries, mainly in the United States, Japan and in Europe. A large number of feeders are in service under voltages of 63, 69, 90, 110 and 138 kV, but some problems result, however, in the case of higher service voltages. Here, the authors give the test results which enabled a 220 kV feeder cable, with extruded polyethylene insulation to be produced. This cable is laid in a sub-station, close to Paris and has been in normal operation for seven months."
"A series of 159 switching operations and other tests were made on AEP's first 765 kv line and stations to be placed in service. Extensive data was obtained and compared with design data in the areas of switching surge overvoltage generation under varied conditions, methods -for limiting overvoltages, characteristics of equipments, and radio interference and audible noise. The results of the initial analysis of this data are presented here."
"A new hybrid comparison technique for transmission line protection, providing polar characteristics marked by sharp discontinuities, has been developed. The comparator models, described in block schematic form, accompany a steady state theoretical basis for comparison. Dynamic test results are indicated for a directional quadrilateral characteristic which closely corresponds to the probable fault area of a transmission line."
"Modal components are customarily used in transmission line radio noise calculations [1-4]. Complete modal transformation [5] produces attenuation and phase constants (losses and velocities of propagation) within the modes. In order to fully utilize this technique, the frequently adopted assumption of random phase relation between the modes at the point of recombination is replaced by a more exact approach in this paper. The correlation of the modes is found mathematically and compared with approximations discussed in the literature [3, 4]. To the authors' knowledge, the analysis presented here closes a gap in the literature on the subject. Its practical importance is most evident for unsymmetrical corona conditions, as they may exist on double-circuit ac and dc lines, and wherever the contributions from the phases shall be calculated separately."
"This paper presents an approach to and the results of applying Linear Programming to the forecasting of minimum production costs of electric utility systems. It describes the linear problem format used in the optimization of the start-up and load allocation of generating units. Included are results from investigations of the influence of linear versus nonlinear unit cost/output curves and the number of time segments used to approximate a load duration curve. A comparison is made with production costs obtained from an established program. The results show that production costing can be reduced to a linear problem with little loss of accuracy. The speed, accuracy, and flexibility achieved by using Linear Programming techniques make it a desirable method of production costing for many study purposes."
"A stochastic procedure is described for producing probabilistic forecasts of monthly peak system demands for up to three years ahead. The procedure is based on well-known concepts of prediction theory of stationary stochastic time series, which are developed further to predict those types of nonstationary series that can be reduced to a stationary series by a finite linear transformation. The procedure yields a technique for forecasting the evolving, nonstationary and seasonal peak power demands."
"Radio, television, and audio interference are rapidly becoming controlling factors in the design and planning of power lines. With the increasing attention being directed to the problem of the deterioration of man's environment, this subject will be given greater consideration by utilities in the future. This paper, sponsored by the Radio Noise Subcommittee, summarizes the state of the art at this date. Utility engineers and the industry should find it a valuable tool in the design of high-voltage transmission lines."
"This paper presents a computational procedure to reschedule generation and power interchanges in an optimal manner. Rescheduling is used as a means for correcting a potentially dangerous operating condition and bringing a vulnerable system into a secure operating state. A linear-programming formulation of the optimal rescheduling problem is developed, and the method is illustrated on a small network example. Rigorous formulation and inclusion of all security- related constraints assures that the solution always represents a secure system. This preventive procedure has a potential for on-line implementation, and is shown to be a natural adjunct of on-line contingency evaluation."
"The Conemaugh 500-kV system stability studies indicated that stability was achieved for all faults that were cleared in 4.5 cycles. If a breaker fails to clear a 3-phase fault, it is necessary to resort to a breaker failure timing scheme of 7.5 cycles and to down grade the fault to a single phase-to-ground fault by independent pole operation of the circuit breaker in order to maintain stability. To cover abnormal conditions when instability may still occur, out-of-step relays on generators are being applied to trip the unit when the first unstable swing appears in the unit transformer."
"The paper presents a dynamic simulation of an HVDC system by digital computer employing converter equations based on averaged values. The converters are represented by perfect dc generators and motors, their outputs are equal to those from real converters with the sixth and higher harmonics being neglected. The converter control circuit of the system is represented by actual hardware. Due to the simplified representation the program enables a considerable saving of computation time with minimal loss of accuracy."
"The paper introduces and develops a new technique for the design of HVDC control system, by representing the overall HV dc system by an approximate linear control system. From the frequency response of the uncompensated system the time constant of the controller is selected, and then based on the physical limitations the overall gain of the system is adjusted. The paper outlines the step-by-step method for the design of controller (inverse cosine method) by means of a digital computer. The selected control components are tested with the simplified digital models developed in a companion paper,8 and also with a more sophisticated program.1 The test results of the simple and detail program justify the development of the simple- program, and also the method of design for the control components."
"Finite-difference approximations are developed for steady state potential problems which contain floating conductors of arbitrary shape. The ability to solve floating conductor field problems underlies the development of two methods for determining the charge- voltage relationship among a set of conductors. A practical example- the modeling of a lightning arrester-is used to illustrate and evaluate these methods."
"In selecting parameters for large hydropower generating units such as those for the Grand Coulee Third Powerplant, control characteristics to satisfy power system needs can strongly influence economics of the design. The needs for abnormal mechanical inertia and expensive reduction of the penstock water starting time are shown to be mitigated by refinement of governor characteristics. This paper describes selection of controllability to meet power system needs, relation of controllability to mechanical inertia and the penstock time constant to facilitate economic proportioning, influence of the governing system and its refinement with several new features for improved performance."
"The paper describes a computer program that has been developed to dispatch power from several alternative sources, including a pumped storage unit, three interchange contracts, two hydro plants, and sixteen steam plants. The program yields the optimum hourly schedule based on a forty-eight hour load prediction. Long-run effects are explicitly taken into account by coordinating three separate subprograms: hourly optimization over forty-eight hours, daily optimization over one month, and monthly optimization over one year."
"An essential component of a comprehensive, real-time control center for power systems is a method for the calculation of short-term load forecasts. This paper explores the use of general exponential smoothing to develop an adaptive forecasting system based on observed values of integrated hourly demand. A model is developed which offers high accuracy and operational simplicity. Forecasts of hourly MWH load with lead times of one to twenty-four hours are computed at hourly intervals throughout the week. A pragmatic viewpoint is maintained throughout the paper, which includes an analysis of two years of hourly load data, test results for the method developed, and discussions of adjustments for holidays and weather disturbances."

"Carbon filled polymers find wide use in industry. In many instances the carbon is added to impart certain electrical properties to the finished product. This paper addresses itself to the latter application. Carbon filled thermoplastics or elastomers are used in the cable and wire industry mainly to take advantage of their pseudo semi-conducting nature. They are usually extruded as shields on electric power cables. Although these materials are widely used, less is known about the mechanism of charge transport through them than is known on either the pure polymer or the carbon filler itself. In the following paragraphs an attempt will be made to explain the experimentally observed conduction in terms of a combination of two classical conduction mechanisms."
"An extensive study of conduction mechanism of carbon black dispersion in polyethylene and cross-linked polyethylene has been made in order to create a basis for design of semi-conducting extruded shields. It has been found that an ac resistance-capacitance bridge is a simple and convenient tool for this study. Simplified mathematical equations have been developed which relate electrical parameters of semi-conducting shields as measured by the ac bridge to the physical structure of conducting chains. Requirements and typical properties concerning semi-conducting shields have been discussed."
"This paper describes a mathematical model of the continuous vulcanizing process for power cables insulated with vulcanizable polyethylene and a computer program which provides a simulation of that process. It is shown that the program's predictions and real situations correlate closely over a wide range of conditions. Practical application of the simulation is illustrated."
"Introducing the Self-Adjusting Accelerator, a completely new digital computer method of solving a power system network load-flow is presented. With no sacrifice in accuracy, a mathematically rigorous solution (employing A B C D1 constants) is obtained using less computer time than any other nodal iterative method."
"In the method presented the load flow equations are divided into two groups. An algorithm is developed where the first group is handled by a Point Jacobi method and the second group by Newton's method. Experimental evidence indicates that the algorithm achieves significant savings in storage and computation requirements over the use of Newton's method on both groups of equations."
"The paper illustrates a new piecewise load flow algorithm and other techniques by which the computer requirements become almost independent of the network being studied. The algoritlvn and methods are thoroughly explained, a computer program is described, and the results of solving a sample system are given."
"The allowable current which may be carried by a given conductor size cable has been thoroughly investigated in almost every conceivable type of cable installation. One area which has not had much attention up to now is the allowable current which can be carried by cables in cable trays, or troughs. This paper presents a completely general method for calculating the ampacities of cables in cable trays; it has been derived from elementary heat transfer theory and amply verified with many full-scale tests. The method shows that currently published ampacities for small cables in highly filled trays must be reduced, but the large cable ampacities can be safely increased."
"The Waltz Mill Project, part of the Electric Research Council's program, is a research center devoted to performing accelerated life testing of underground transmission systems. At this station prototype samples can be tested at voltages ranging from 115 to 1000 kV. This paper describes the control systems, instrumentation circuits, and computer programs presently available at Waltz Mill for cable testing."
 "The current unbalance in two 113 mile long, electrically parallel, untransposed 500 kV overhead transmission line sections is studied for conditions in which some or all of the series-capacitor compensation is removed from individual circuits. It is shown that a negative sequence current of over 25% of the positive sequence line current can flow for certain phasing arrangements of the conductors and when one circuit is 70% series-capacitor compensated while the other circuit is uncompensated."
"A method is presented for analyzing the results of stability calculations using generator transfer admittances to calculate power flows between generators. It is shown that the equations for power flow from any generator to all other generators can be used to define an equivalent system bus unique to that generator. Functions which indicate the capability of a generator to maintain synchronism are presented with illustrations of their application."
"Many models for the representation of transmission lines may be found in the present literature. The increasing use of digital techniques to solve the switching surge problem has prompted the development of models for other particular components of a power system. Specifically, the accurate representation of circuit breakers and power transformers is of vital importance in almost all switching surge studies. Presented here is a generalized direct-integration method that, while accurately reproducing the traveling-wave phenomena in transmission lines, advances a procedure for the simulation of circuit breakers (with insertion resistors) and power transformers. The results from a switching surge study on a representative three-phase system are discussed in detail."
"This paper introduces a new philosphy in the formation or modification of the bus impedance matrix used in short circuit studies of a coupled system. The mutual is first ignored in generating the matrix. Later the effect of mutual coupling is added at one time by a new algorithm. Programming considerations for successful implementation are discussed."
"A non-iterative method has been developed for computing reflection and transfer coefficient matrices for use in traveling wave studies on three-phase power systems. The method has been programmed, verified by reproducing field tests, and applied to a practical study. The program has the capability of including three- phase untransposed transmission lines, multi-velocity waves, single- pole switching, lightning arresters, and transformer hysteresis. All calculations of reflection and transfer coefficient matrices are done automatically to minimize data preparation."
"A tracking static state estimator is a digital feedback loop (a computer algorithm) which uses real time measurements of voltage magnitudes, watt flows, and var flows to track the static state (voltage at all buses) as it varies during the daily load cycle. The design and performance of simple gain matrices suitable for wide ranges of operating conditions are discussed."
"The high voltage direct current link is normally an integral part of the overall composite system. The design of any subsystem should be such that it does not materially effect the reliability of the overall system. The application of probability techniques can play an important role in the determination of subsystem and overall system adequacy. Numerous papers have been published on the application of probability methods to the evaluation of generating, transmission and distribution system reliability evaluation. The probability method used in the analysis of the dc subsystem should be compatible with that available for the ac system thus leading to overall composite system reliability evaluation."
"The application of Markov analysis1 and recursive techniques2 to the determination of the required number of mercury arc valves to achieve a given bridge reliability was illustrated in Part I \" Spare Valve Assessment in Mercury Arc Bridge Configurations\". It was shown in this paper that the number of states required to model a particular configuration increases rapidly with the number of bridges and the number of spare valves. This is particularly true in multiple bridge configurations when the identities of the individual bridges are maintained. While the bridge configuration is a major component of the dc link, it is still only one of the many subsystems which make up the entire dc system. It is, therefore, necessary to combine all these models to generate a complete model for the system. This combination becomes quite difficult while maintaining the complex models for the bridge configuration. A similar situation exists in generating capacity reliability evaluation when considering multiple boiler turbines3. This paper illustrates the reduction of the complex bridge configuration models to their equivalents and their combination with other subsystem models to obtain reliability indices for the complete system."
"The theoretical analysis of bipolar corona developed by the authors in an earlier paper is applied to study the corona loss characteristics of practical bipolar HVDC transmi$ sion lines. Detailed results of the influence of the line parameters on the corona loss characteristics of single-conductor as well as of bundle-conductor bipolar lines are given in the paper."
"The electrical discharge characteristics of SF6 are discussed theoretically in relation to the field dependence of the ionization coefficient a and the electron attachment coefficient The results are compared with the characteristics of air. A simple theoretical formulation of breakdown or corona inception voltages of gaps in SF6 is derived. The formulation has been examined by experiments on several electrode configurations. At low pressures of less than 4 atm, the agreement of the theoretical and the experimental results is fairly good. The breakdown voltage decreases from the theoretical estimation at higher pressure."
"This paper describes the breakdown potential gradient of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) at pressures up to 4 kg/cm2 absolute against power frequency, switching impulse and standard impulse voltages in nearly uniform fields such as plane-plane, sphere- sphere, and coaxial cylinder electrode configurations. Electrode material, smoothness and polarity effect are also investigated for coaxial cylinders."
"Potential gradient at the surface of the electrode is the most important factor in the breakdown of SF6 gas as reported in a companion paper. Hence the breakdown voltage may be predicted from the potential gradient at the surface of the electrode with technically acceptable accuracy."
"This paper covers the derivations of a hyperbolic partial differential equation for the dynamic arc radius in a circuit breaker nozzle. Starting at peak current, this equation is solved for a linear current ramp to determine the current zero arc radius. It is shown that axial convection cooling, augmented by radiation and diffusion, can produce a constricted arc radius of the order of 0.1 cm at current zero. Equations are derived, expressing the thermal time constant, at current zero as a function of the pressure, current derivative, arc length and gas properties. Finally, it is shown that the hyperbolic equation can be integrated to obtain a Cassie type equation for arc resistance during the pre-current- zero arcing period."
"This paper covers the derivation of two sets of short line fault equations for the maximum rate of rise of recovery voltage (RRRV) characteristic of gas blast interrupters. The assumption that the electrical conductivity is proportional to the heat flux potential leads to a Cassie integral equation for post-arc current, a critical thermal time constant and the first set of RRRV equations. The assumption that the electrical conductivity varies exponentially with the heat flux potential leiads to the Mayr equation and the second set of RRRV equations. For both sets of equations it is shown that the maximum RRRV is (a) approximately proportional to the gas pressure; (b) proportional to the effective nozzle arc length at current zero and the number of series breaks; (c) proportional to temperature dependent coefficients which are functions of gas properties; and (d) inversely proportional to (dI/dt)m where m=3/2 and 1 for the \"Cassie\" and \"Mayr\" RRRV equations, respectively. These equations are complementary and serve as \"first-order\" limits on the interrupting capability of gas blast interrupters."
"This paper presents the results of an Anacom study which investigated the performance of modern lightning arresters during switching surge operation. A description of the variable characteristic arrester model used to simulate the lightning arrester is presented as are the results of the study using the model on a representative 345-kV system. Particular emphasis is placed on the parameters effecting the discharge current, voltages and energy with attention given to the protective characteristic of the arrester."
"A more precise analysis of switching surges on transmission lines requires a detailed investigation of the effects of earth resistivity. Presented in this paper is a method for the digital computation of such effects. A basic knowledge of field theory has been combined with an accurate digital integration technique to provide a solution that is both accurate and straightforward."
"This paper describes the analytical procedure of determining the attenuation and distortion of fault-generated surges on transmission lines when the skin effects of conductor and earth are taken into account. Herein, the term which considers the skin effect of the earth has been modified. After comparing the results with known approaches, a method, for selecting the circuit parameters of the detection circuit which is used to couple the fault signal from the transmission line to the fault-locating equipment, is given."
"In the last years, high-voltage substations in several countries have suffered great damage owing to earthquakes. The typical earthquake damage is analized, and means are discussed for improving the seismic behavior of flexible high-voltage apparatus which has shown to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. A withstand specification is derived as a guide for determining whether a high- voltage equipment is or is not likely to be damaged during an earthquake."
"Construction of the Pacific Intertie transmission system, and other related EHV lines has included unprecedented installations of 500 kV series capacitors. Twenty series capacitor banks, totaling 4,465 mvar, and providing 70% reactance compensation, have been installed in California by Southern California Edison Company and Pacific Gas and Electric Company."
"A solid-state acceleration relay has recently been developed by the Bureav of Reclamation for use in data acquisition, but with potential, also for use in generator dropping and load shedding schemes. A pilot model of the relay has been installed at Palisades Powerplant in Idaho to assist in collection of system performance parameters. Data acquired during a major system disturbance demonstrate the potential value of the acceleration relay for sensing behavior and for eventually improving power system reliability."
"This paper presents radio noise measurements made near overhead power lines from 2.4 to 345 kV in the frequency range of 60 Hz to 1 GHz and on radio noise measurements made on 7.2, 345, 525, 735, and 765-kV ac lines and on an 800-kV dc test line up to 10 GHz. The measurements and their analysis show the important radio noise factors involved in the development and use of prediction techniques for the evaluation of communication site performance in the vicinity of overhead power lines."
"The paper develops a-method of determining the minimum amount of reactive power capacity installation required to satisfy constrained system voltage conditions. The solution gives both location and amount of reactive sources. Sensitivity parameters are the basis of the model, and linear programming is used to obtain the solution. The method is practical and static operating constraints are naturally included. Numerical examples illustrate the application of the method."
"Transient currents are considered for converter and line short-circuits with particular regard to the implications for thyristor valves. The transient behaviour of automatic firing-angle control is taken into account. Selected waveforms of transient fault currents and related data are presented, as derived from a digital computer dynamic program."
"Statistical procedures have been developed, computer programs prepared and documented, and techniques tested for the preparation of weekly and seasonal peak demand forecasts with lead times up to seven years. Probability information in the form of both standard deviation and 99% confidence interval gives a comprehensive basis for system planning but this can be supplemented by a tabulation of the forecast's probability distribution in cases where more detailed information is needed. The practicality of the forecasting procedure has been demonstrated by tests with data from four electric utility companies having different types of service territory and varied load composition. Results are included for three of these companies."
"A unique relay system developed for B. C. Hydro's Peace River Project is described herein. The line protection consists of a semi-static dual primary, direct under-reaching transfer trip and permissive over-reaching schemes with microwave and power line channels connected redundantly. The relaying system was thoroughly tested on a model transmission line so that adequate consideration could be given to the effect of load current, swings, and transients related to series capacitors, line shunt capacitance and switching."
"Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the degradation of dc line and station insulation strength by icing. Curves are presented which relate flashover levels to the degree of icing and the resistivity of the ice, and comparisons are made between the ice test results and fog chamber and wet test data."
"The Kettle hydro-electric development by Manitoba Hydro is located on the Nelson River in the Province of Manitoba and is unique in that, up to now, it is the only generating station in the Western world which will feed exclusively into a dc transmission system. Because of this, some features associated with this plant are somewhat different from conventional hydro-electric developments and this paper will describe these featurestogether with certain other electrical and mechanical aspects of the project."
"Pumped storage equipment has played a significant role in the storage and distribution of water at Oroville. This paper describes the mechanical design features of the pump/turbines installed in the Edward Hyatt Power Plant, and the niany tests performed during design and startup to achieve water delivery requirements. The experiences gained from this installation should stimulate the further development of pumped storage by utilities and consulting engineers."
"This paper presents a method for the heat transfer analysis of a circulating oil cooled cable system with emphasis on evaluation of the heat transfer mechanism between the circulating oil and the cable components. Based on a review of the iiterature the conclusion was that there is a lack of available test data which can be directly applied to this specific case. It was determined that the oil film heat transfer mechanism is a combination of forced and free convection. Evaluating these two individually and treating them as separate resistances in parallel leads to the conclusion that if the oil flow is laminar the forced convection resistance is mnuch greater than the free convection resistance. Thus conservative forced cooled ratings can be obtained by-neglecting forced convection and calculating oil film resistances based on free convection only."
"The thermal ratings of forced cooled and self-cooled cable runs are reviewed in order to assess the merit of forced cooling. These ratings, along with those of forced cooled joints, are employed to show that the ampacity of a 138 kV, 2000 kc mil high pressure oil filled pipe type system can be increased by at least 100o through forced cooling by circulating the pipe oil. The refrigeration requirements to permit this increased ampacity is determined, and the flow schemes which will meet these requirements are outlined along with the generic design of a refrigeration package to implement the preferred flow scheme. This generic design is used as the basis for an economic analysis which shows that single forced cooled cable ampacities greater than the ratings of a pair of self-cooled cables can be achieved at a 20% cost saving over the use of two self-cooled cables to meet the same load requirement. The emergency ratings of these forced cooled cables which correspond to the usual 100 and 300 hour emergency ratings are found to be 8 and 6% of the 100% duty cycle rating."
"This paper constitutes an analysis and summary of some of the test data obtained to date in conjunction with the forced-cooling of a full scale, 1.5 mile long, 138 kV, pipe-type cable line. Two methods of forced-cooling are discussed: (1) the return pipe method and (2) mechanical refrigeration. The paper is largely concerned with the return pipe method since the mechanical refrigeration tests are still under way. Design equations for estimating pressure drop and oil temperatures are presented."
"The paper examines the relationship between heat flux and sheath temperature for closely spaced underground power transmission systems using both a numerical and an experimental analog approach. The closely spaced condition tends to occur with the recently developed high voltage gas insulated conductors and it is shown that the traditional method of calculation yields sheath temperatures which can be too high by up to 25%."
"Dielectric recovery data is presented following forced current interruption of 930 A dc copper vapor arcs in a vacuum interrupter. At given free recovery periods during the first 6 to 25 , us following interruption, the instantaneous dielectric strength is determined by the application of high voltage step function pulses. This instantaneous dielectric strength is defined as the maximum voltage which can be consistently reapplied without causing reignition. The influence of electrode spacing (0.6 or 1.3 cm), shield potential and the polarity of the reapplied voltage on the recovery of dielectric strength have been determined. The more rapid rate of recovery initially observed at long spacings is attributed to the lower mean inter-electrode vapor density immediately following interruption. Recovery is also more rapid for \"reverse\" rather than \"same\" polarity reapplication indicating surface effects, in particular the roughening of the cathode surface during arcing. Post arc currents lead to an initial reduction of dielectric strength for \"reverse\" reapplication with the vapor shield tied to the \"arcing-anode\". The mechanism of these post arc currents has been investigated by observations of the high ion currents which flow to a negatively biased shield during and immediately following arcing."
"The magnetic effects of induced eddy currents in thin conducting sheets are analyzed by means of moving current images and by an electrical circuit analogy. The methods are applied to practical power system equipment problems such as shielding and the calculation of conductor short circuit forces."
"Axial currents of power frequency flowing in a filament parallel to a cylindrical shell of one boundary, give rise to eddy currents in the conducting material of the shell due to proximity effect. Axial currents flowing in the shell give rise to skin effect. The distribution of both these currents is determined analytically by solving the differential equation for penetration of currents in the conducting material and appropriatelly applying boundary conditions. The phase difference of the current density at every point of the cross section and the loss are also determined. Both, shell and current filament are assumed to have an infinite length. The material of the shell is considered to be non- magnetic."

"This work makes a three-phase TNA study of the most commonly observed subharmonic oscillation, that is, the 1/3-order subharmonic. Symmetrical Y-connected systems are studied wherein the neutral is firstly solidly-grounded, and secondly resistively-grounded. The influence on the subharmonic performance of this, and other system parameters, is determined. The belief that 1/3-order subharmonic oscillations could not occur in ungrounded symmetrical systems is shown to be incorrect."
 "This paper covers the analysis of the problem of self-excited current oscillations which may occur when synchronous machines are closely coupled to transmission lines which are highly compensated with series capacitors. A mathematical analysis is made. Corrective measures are suggested and the results of confirming tests are discussed. Two typical system configurations which would be likely to produce these self-excited oscillations are used as examples for detailed calculations."
"An evaluation of the classical solution to the traveling wave problem is presented for comparison with a computer simulation of the problem. The purpose of the tests presented in the paper has been to evaluate the effect of a distributed, constant resistance on single-phase and three-phase transmission lines from a theoretical point of view. The results give some insight into the basic phenomena and demonstrate how this resistance produces distortion intthe traveling wave. Although the general multiphase representation developed is valid for any conductor configuration, only results for a continuously transpbsed three-phase line are presented in the paper. The results show that the ground component resistance has a significant influence on the coupled voltage when switching the first phase of a three-phase line."
"The reduction of switching overvoltages by means of synchronized circuit-breakers with pre-insertion resistors is studied. The influence of system and breaker parameters is ascertained. The study shows that the reduction obtainable in a shunt-compensated system is sufficient for future UHV applications. A method for the rapid reinsertion of disconnected shunt reactors is also investigated."
"The influence on switching surges of different line zero sequence impedances is analysed here by means of the transient network analyzer (TNA). Consideration is given to two different 735 kV lines with various connections of ground wires to towers. In addition, the reclosing surges evaluated with a sophisticated earth-return simulation are compared with those obtained with the usual constant-inductance simulation."
"This paper describes a method for determining the transient voltages and currents in long multiconductor transmission lines using a digitally simulated hybrid computer. A detailed representation of the propagation function is developed to simulate each mode of propagation. This approximation is used to study a three phase ac line and a two pole dc line. Experimental verification of the computer results is obtained from \" H\" section models of the lines. Finally, a system consisting of an ac line and a dc line on a common right-of-way is analyzed. Computer results showing the voltages induced on the ac line due to a line-to- ground fault on the dc line are provided."
"Switching-surge overvoltages are a major concern in the establishment of insulation levels of modern EHV and UHV power systems. Transient Network Analyzer (TNA) and digital model simulations of these systems are the primary means of determining what the insulation levels should be before the actual systems are constructed."
"The phase symmetrization technique of obtaining a well balanced winding from a combination of unbalanced winding components, has been successfully applied to the pole amplitude modulated windings to obtain a well balanced winding for the initial as well as for the modulated poles. Methods of designing these windings using this technique are presented for a number of cases. Theoretical analysis is supported by exhaustive test results. It is concluded that this technique is useful in cases where it is desired to go from a lower pole number to a higher pole number such as 6/8, 8/10, 10/12,...etc."
"The windings of pole-changing single-phase induction motors reported hitherto contain various proportions of harmonics. It is well known that harmonic m. m. f. s cause objectionable vibration and noise and generally impair machine performance."
"This paper reports upon the development of a unit commitment method, and its implementation in program form on a 100 machine system. The method presented satisfies the many operating constraints that are encountered in system operations. The unit commitment function is employed by operating personnel for both actual operations and for operations planning. The paper discussed the elapsed computing time required to perform the commitment function in a process computer while executing higher priority functions and also the substantial savings realized in system operations over manual methods of commitment."

"This paper deals with the problem of obtaining the optimal scheduling of a pumped storage hydroelectric plant in combination with, several interconnected power systems. A special case of interest is the scheduling of pumped storage when the plant is jointly owned by several electric utilities. A mnathematical model is developed in order to determine the power flows between the different power systems and the pumped storage plant as well as the water flows inside the plant."
"A modern high voltage laboratory has to be shielded mainly to avoid the electromagnetic disturbances of the partial discharge measurements. The paper describes the practical methods of shielding a high voltage laboratory and introduces a simplified method for shielding calculations which takes into account the effect of the seams, conducting gaskets, short-circuited slots and sound absorbing holes. A numerical example illustrates the results in the case of a large hall."
"The response characteristics of a resistor divider with dividing element on high voltage side were investigated theoretically and experimentally. As the results, it was revealed that it could be realized a divider having an excellent response characteristic by this method."
"By computer aided analysis, simple equations are derived to identify accurately the time to crest of a recorded switching surge of any wave shape. These equations allow also the determination of the tail duration without the need of recording it. A method, based on optimum voltage efficiency, is set up to calculate, for any given wave shape, the components of the impulse generating system. The results of the study are particularly useful for relatively long tailed switching surges."
"After some basic considerations the dynamic properties of the measuring system are subjected to a general examination based on a number of responses, characteristic of the system. It is demonstrated that an impulse circuit has an internal impedance different from zero, for which reason the interaction between the generator and the measuring circuit is of paramount importance to the voltage across the test object. Based on the measured values the determination of the applied voltage is considered."

"A long run flashover test was carried out from 1967 to 1969 to investigate the effect of atmospheric humidity on lightning and switching 50-percent flashover voltages of air gaps and suspension insulators. From the test results, it was found that the influence of humidity on flashover voltages of air gaps varied greatly from their flashover voltage-gap length characteristics."
"Analyses have been made of the sensitivity of lightning outage rate predictions to uncertainties and variations in the various parameters incorporated in the normal prediction methods. The influence of upward streamers on the insulator voltages produced by charge in the stroke channel has been studied, and it is shown that the magnitudes of these voltages are very dependent on the assumed length of the streamers."
"During the last few years, there has been expanded effort throughout the country to install frequency actuated load shedding programs for the purpose of providing means to safeguard a power system should a condition of declining frequency occur. Hand in hand with a load shedding program a convenient means must be provided for restoring load after the system returns to a normal state. In this series of papers, the authors will present some of the basic principles which should be considered in the application of a load shedding and load restoration program and will describe the philosophy which led to the frequency actuated load shedding and load restoration program being implemented on the American Electric Power System. As part of this presentation, the various analytical studies which were carried out to determine the load management programs for the AEP system will be described in detail. In addition, the method of program implementation and management is presented in a companion paper."
"Power systems must be operated within limits that will ensure adequate generation and transmission capacity to avoid cascading. In developing a set of operating limits, it is important to do so within a general framework in order to ensure that the operating objectives are met. In this regard, a set of general guidelines are presented below: 1. The integrity of the transmission system will be maintained at all times without planned internal separation. 2. Maximum reasonable assistance will be given to adjacent systems experiencing difficulty. However, such assistance will be terminated - without opening interconnection circuits - when the reliable operation of the assisting system is impaired. 3. The system should be operated so that the occurrence of the next single contingency (outage of tower, circuit, unit, breaker, bus, etc.) will not result in a cascading loss of the bulk transmission system. The single contingency is continually geared to the current state of the system and reflects maintenance and forced outage events as they occur. In addition, when evaluating overload contingencies, the time to relieve the stress must be compared to the permissible degree of overload. 4. When the system experiences a generation-load imbalance, the principles of sound interconnected operation will be maintained by bringing under control an unscheduled tie-line power flow condition as quickly as possible."
"The stabilization of power systems with excitation control using speed or power signals has been very well developed,1-6 while the application of optimal control to power system stability study is relatively new.7 Both are based on linear models. In this paper, a comparison is made of these two techniques. Signals derived from a lower order linear model are tested on a high order non-linear system modelled as a single machine-infinite bus as well as multi-machine systems."
"The thermal requirements of resistors used for power system transient voltage control are a function of the applied voltage, the resistor ohmic value, and insertion time. These energy requirements are discussed for resistors used in circuit breakers for closing and/or opening operations and also for repetitive duty cycles. The thermal design levels are derived from fault duty, line energizing, line reenergizing, and out-of-step conditions."
"Over 400 low-side switching operations energizing EHV transmission lines were carried out by the Department of Water and Power, City of Los Angeles. These extensive field tests included measurement of the magnitude and range of overvoltages produced under various system conditions and with different values of preinsertion resistors. The purpose of the investigation was to gain first-hand field experience with low-side switching operation and to confirm the validity of Transient Network Analyzer (TNA) studies conducted with similar circuit parameters."
"In the early part of 1968, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, with whom the authors are associated, began a study to determine the most economical means of switching 230 kV shunt capacitor banks of 84 MVAR each."
"This paper describes a basic method to determine the crest value of the transient inrush currents flowing in power transformer windings resulting either from imperfect synchronizing procedures or from erroneous switching operations. The currents which flow under these unusual conditions are similar in magnitude and envelope to through-short circuit faults and may, in some cases, exceed the currents which flow through transformer windings during three-phase faults on their terminals."
"This paper documents procedures to be used by member companies of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection to establish normal and emergency thermal ratings for power transformers affecting the Interconnection. The method can also be used to select the nameplate ratings of new transformers. Insulation systems containing the older standard kraft papers (55°C rise), and also the newer improved insulation (65°C rise), used after approximately 1958) are both considered. A complete review of the principles, parameters, and limits necessary to determine thermal performance and ratings was undertaken. The rating method was expressed in the form of a computer program, which all companies of the Interconnection have agreed upon, to ensure consistent ratings for any given application of power interchange transformers."
"Block diagrams of synchronous machines supplying an infinite bus or lumped parameter load are develQped for large and small-signals. This representation includes the effects of saliency, the amortisseurs, variable speed operation, positive and negative sequence components of the infinite bus voltage and an approximate treatment of the saturation. The paper illustrates the application of the block diagram technique. First, the electrical torques proportional to the load angle and their contribution to the overall transfer function of the torque-angle loop are investigated by the elementary theory of servomechanisms. Second, transfer functions are derived for excitation system analysis. Finally self-excitation of the machine connected to a capacitive load is described."
"An all solid-state regulator with new and improved features over existing regulators has been developed. The new regulator is currently being applied in both brushless excitation systems and static excitation systems for electric utility applications. Solid state circuitry is ideally suited for the application of multiple supplementary control functions required in modern systems. Draw-out modular construction simplifies installation, testing, adjusting, and maintenance of the excitation system components."
"To suppress the hunting of synchronous machine caused by stepwise load change, a dual mode field excitation control was investigated for conventional (one-axis) machine and 2-axis machine. For one-axis machine, a dual mode is applied successively, the first one being a bang-bang suboptimal control mode decided by use of energy function instead of Pontryagin's switching function, this mode is applicable to dynamic equation described in nonlinear form. The second one is a linear feedback control mode composed of a linear combination of state variables, and it will be adopted to the range near the steady state operating point where the equation will be linearized. For 2-axis machine at the instant of load change the original excitation introduced by mixing these two controls is efficiently applied. From the results of the investigation it is recognized that the employment of 2-axis synchronous machine is a potential means for the improvement of system stability."
"Transients in electrical power systems at many installations are found to cause malfunctions in and damage to electronic equipment. Investigations to date indicate that harmful transients are injected into the critical power bus by both external and internal transients producers. Oscilloscope recordings show that the harmful transients consist of oscillatory voltages having predominant frequency components as low as 400 Hertz and high-frequency disturbances in the form of spike voltages as short as 10 μsec in duration. A study was conducted on the feasibility of developing power filters which could prevent the externally produced transients from reaching transient- sensitive electronic equipment, and prevent load-caused transients from reaching the critical power bus. Based on the findings, a single-phase filter was designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated."
"The specification, design, and testing of arresters for the HVDC Pacific Coast Intertie are discussed. Included in the report is a description of the overvoltage events significant to arrester design and the resulting specification. The basic problems associated with dc arrester design and techniques used to overcome these problems are covered."
"Current limiting gap arresters can be designed to operate successfully against switching surges and sustained overvoltages, but the current drawn by the arrester and the energy dissipated is a function of the circuit impedance as well as the system voltage and arrester design. Arresters designed to operate against sustained overvoltages may produce sufficient discharge voltage during operation to exceed arrester sparkover voltage and thus not provide the protection expected. A test method is suggested to determine the maximum voltage that an arrester may produce under normal operating conditions."
"This paper deals with a research aimed at testing possible means for reducing the effects of the saturation of the switching surge withstand voltage in line insulation."
"This paper presents data on performance of air gaps of up to 29 meters, which is beyond any previously reported. The data is raw data without any endeavor being made to compensate for the many atmospheric variables which could affect the results. However, many of these atmospheric conditions were recorded and are reported herein for future analysis and comparison with the results from other test projects."
"The paper shows that the vacuum circuit breaker is well suited for the duties that a circuit breaker must perform. Reasonable care must be taken under certain circumstances when applying these breakers. Such applications are identified and simple corrective measures are proposed."
"Criteria for switching-surge design of uhv tower insulation are discussed on the basis of test results obtained at Project UHV. Basic design curves and correction factors are presented. This information makes it possible to evolve preliminary designs of basic tower insulation for system voltages up to 1500 kV."
"The switching-surge performance of a large number of basic uhv transmission line insulation configurations has been extensively studied. The paper reports on outside phase, tower window, conductor- to-ground (with and without protrusions), conductor-to-conductor, vertical and horizontal rod-rod and rod-plane gaps. The investigated air gaps range from 10 to 66 ft (3.0 to 20.1 m) and the associated switching-surge strengths range from 1100 to 2700 kV. The paper extends earlier work1 and offers numerous design curves to the transmission line designer for uhv transmission systems up to 1500-kV system voltage."
"The \"wet contaminant\" test method, originally developed for use with alternating voltage, is extended for use with switching surges. In order to evaluate insulators under conditions where dry bands would form, it was found necessary to first energize the contaminated insulators with alternating voltage before applying the surges. Included in the investigation are the effect of front time and tail time on the critical flashover voltages, and a comparison of the switching surge performance of five insulator types under various levels of contamination."
"The effect of surface discharges on the ability of polluted insulators to withstand lightning and switching surges has long been a matter of conjecture. This paper describes combined power frequency and impulse voltage tests on 66 kV and 132 kV insulator strings. The tests have shown that an appreciable lowering of both lightning and switching surge strength may occur in the presence of pollution layers. The worst lowering of impulse strength (about 50%) has been found in cases where drying of the pollution has reduced the leakage current almost to zero by the production of extensive dry bands on the insulator surface."
"During the past two years, unexplained flashovers have caused 32 outages on the Bonneville Power Administration 500 kV ac transmission lines. Tests reported in this paper indicate that some of these unexplained flashovers may have been caused by large birds and leave little or no evidence of the cause. It is also shown that this mechanism may cause flashovers on ehv dc transmission lines."
"Attention is focused on the character of neutral-displacement voltages produced at ungrounded, shunt capacitor banks during normal switching of the bank. Closing operations, opening operations, the effects of reignitions or restrikes, the effects of insertion resistors, and the presence of parallel-connected banks are considered in the analysis. The proper application of neutral-displacement voltage detection devices is discussed, particularly the difficulties in using transformers to sense neutral voltage. Finally, several test oscillograms are included to confirm major points of the analytical investigation."
"Station capacitor bank energization transients predicted by a circuit model are compared to field test results. Selection of a suitable model is discussed. A computer solution of the model is presented."
"Equations for computing the frequency and duration of various capacity outages were first given by Halperin and Adler1. The application to the generation area was subsequently extended by the publication of a recent series of papers2-6 which presented a far more general approach to the problem. The general method is extremely powerful and can be applied to a wide range of problems7-9. This paper utilizes the basic concepts previously presented2,3 and extends them to develop a frequency and duration approach to interconnected system reliability evaluation. Equations are developed for one system connected to another system and are subsequently extended to the case of a system connected to two or more systems. The application of the theoretical technique is illustrated in Part II of this paper entitled \"System Applications\"."
"The development of an approach by which frequency and duration indices can be computed for interconnected systems was illustrated in Part I of this paper entitled \"Mathematical Analysis\". Equations were developed for a system connected to one or to more than one other system. These equations have been incorporated in a general computer program for generating capacity reliability evaluation in single and interconnected systems. This portion of the paper entitled \"System Applications\" illustrates the numerical application of these general concepts."
"One of the difficult problems traditionally associated with reliability calculations has been the development of accurate and simple methods for representing the combined effects of (1) device outages due to extemal forces, (2) outages contingent on the load level and other outages, and (3) planned outages for maintenance. This paper shows how system loads, maintenance outages, and forced outages can be represented as two-stage, statistically independent renewal processes. The approach leads to a simplified method for calculating the steady-state rates and durations of the contingencies of interest to the system planner. The paper also shows how these methods are generally more accurate than methods using availability load models and briefly examines the effects of load growth on reliability. Two sample problems using the models are also included."
"The application of probability methods in power system reliability evaluation started over thirty years ago. The bulk of the work has been in the static capacity area and the first major paper on spinning reserve evaluation appeared in 1962(1). A second paper(2) illustrated the application of this approach in a medium size utility. Both these papers illustrated the development of a risk index which includes the probabilities of capacity deficiencies and unforeseen load conditions. In a more recent paper(3), Markov processes were used to determine the transient probabilities associated with a generating unit containing a single derated state. The general expressions are rather complicated and it is difficult to extend this approach to include units with more than one derated state. The discussion to Reference 3 proposes a state space model which assumes that the lead times are small relative to the unit repair times and therefore it is reasonable to assume that no repairs will be made during this lead time. This method though approximate can be applied to units with several derated states."
 "A rational mathematical explanation of the response of post type insulators supporting straight parallel horizontal bus bars to short circuit currents is given. Calculated values of deflection using the formulas derived are shown to be slightly higher than values obtained by test. Finally, simplified formulas and coefficients are presented for use in design."
"The four methods proposed in the literature for the structural design of substation bus systems to withstand short circuit loads are compared in the case of a single, simple element of a substation. These comparisons show that the continuous, dynamic design method, which treats the distributed mass of each element, will provide more reliable designs than will the methods presently in use. They also suggest that this method will provide more economical alternatives for renovation of existing substations, where the cost penalty can be especially severe if the traditional static method is used. It is concluded that the development of the continuous dynamic method for use on a routine basis is warranted, in spite of its computational complexity."
"The first three natural frequencies of selected, 230 and 115 KV, cantilever-mounted insulators were measured using a frequency scanning procedure. The values of these frequencies indicate that the behavior of the insulators under fault load conditions may usually be described by a mathematical model having distributed mass and elasticity, the Euler-Bernoulli equation. The values of the first and second natural frequencies of most of the insulators were found to be less than 120 Hz, indicating that hazards are associated with the use of a single, spring-mounted mass to simulate their forced vibration in the design of substations. Measurements of the decay in their free vibration showed that the inherent damping of the insulators is no more important than the damping of the other structural elements in substations."
"For use in the design of substations, a dynamic analysis of bus structures reacting to the mechanical forces arising from short circuit currents has been developed and programmed for numerical solution on the IBM 360 computer. The analysis is based upon a well established, continuous method for describing the transverse vibration of slender beams having distributed mass and elasticity, the Euler- Bernoulli equation, and treats a member of the structural configurations commonly encountered in substations. Comparisons of predicted displacements with published values from tests on three, full scale structures are presented in this paper to illustrate the success of the analysis in predicting dynamic behavior."
"A theoretical explanation of the supercritical boilerturbine-grid control relation is presented using the results of computer simulation studies. The energy storage behavior of an isolated steam-electric grid is described, and the tuning flexibility of modern control systems is examined from the standpoint of the effects on the stability of grid frequency."
"Complementing the boiler-turbine-grid theoretical relationships presented in Part I of this paper, a description of the dynamic characteristics of the supercritical pressure boiler and its coordinated control system are presented in Part II. This section contains results from both computer simulation studies and actual open and closed loop tests of supercritical boiler plants."
"This paper describes frequency response tests run on one of Ohio Edison Company's large supercritical once-through units. It briefly covers the reason for testing, the apparatus, the procedure and the results. A discussion of the unit control aspects as they apply to the tests is also included."
"Since the installation of its first digitally controlled economic dispatch system in 1959, the Philadelphia Electric Company has been studying in increasing detail the dynamic characteristics of its generating units, for these characteristics affect the performance of the overall system. In planning for a new digital control and data transmission complex, a study was included in the overall project aimed at restructuring the controls of existing units in order to improve their characteristics. A first step in this study was the development and purchase of a new high speed digital data acquisition system for use in the testing and analysis of power plant equipment."
"Dispatching decisions concerned with transmission system security can be improved by the use of objective functions. The method is based on combining a simplified form of the real power flow equations with linear objective functions to answer questions related to system security. Linear programming is used to consecutively solve two linearized flow models, one conservative and one lossy, where the solution of the first serves as input to the second. The accuracy and practicality of the method are illustrated in actual case studies."
"The paper describes a new method of scheduling thermal generating units to achieve minimum operating costs including both running and start-up costs while at the same time maintaining a desired level of system security."
"Emphasis is placed on devising a physically meaningful procedure for hourly load forecasting. It is proposed that accurate forecasting depends on the use of both weather information and historical patterns. In order to efficiently use this information the total load is decomposed into a nominal load, a residual load and a part which reflects the known changes in the load. The forecast is made by forecasting each component load separately. Alternative procedures based on this decomposition are developed and results from a test case study are presented."
"This paper presents present practices within the utility industry in the economic operation of electric power systems. It is intended primarily as a reference for those new in this area of endeavor. It also discusses certain shortcomings of present practices and areas requiring further development."
"A coordination technique is developed which determines the least expensive generation schedule required to maintain a total specified power system regulating margin, where a distinction is made between spinning reserve and regulating margin. The effect on operating cost of applying the regulating margin restraint is also investigated."
"A technique is developed for the optimum scheduling of real and reactive generation in which all the transmission network constraints are met. The procedure which is used utilizes a load-flow solution to satisfy the system power equations. The real and reactive schedules of the swing bus are treated as dependent variables in the optimization portion of the solution method. Inequality constraints are met as limits on the variables in the load-flow portion of the solution. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by means of sample systems."
"Many electric utilities face the problem of expanding transmission systems where new transmission line right-of-way (ROW) is increasingly more costly and difficult to obtain. One alternative is to uprate the voltage of lines on existing ROW to obtain increased transmission capacity. This paper discusses the technical and economic considerations of incrementally uprating the voltage of existing lines. Cost comparisons are made with building new lines on new ROW. There is a broad range of ROW costs and system transmission requirements where voltage uprating of existing transmission lines may be economically attractive."
"This paper deals with the response of bundles of several cables subjected to harmonic exciting forces. It shows how the spacer characteristics expressed by the spacer elastic matrix will impose particular types of natural modes and how excessive spacer stiffness will cause severe bending strains to occur on the cable close to the spacer clamps."
"The problem of simultaneous unbalanced short circuits of synchronous machines is solved for the first time. The complete solutions for armature, field, and damper-circuit currents and for the short-circuit torque are derived directly by mathematical analysis. A numerical example is given and the results are presented by graphs. Comparisons of the present case with single-phase short circuit cases are summarized in Appendix II of this paper."
"All theoretical methods for calculating corona thresholds in a nonuniform electric field depend on precise knowledge of the field distribution near the stressed electrode. The charge simulation technique and the method of images were applied to two twin parallel cylindrical conductors, all located in the same horizontal plane above ground. The charge on the positive and negative subconductors is represented by several lumped charges, and a set of equations are developed whose simultaneous solutions yield equipotential surfaces on the conductor's circumference. These equations were solved for the magnitudes of the lumped charges, whose optimum locations were determined by considering the results over a wide range of line dimensions. A digital computer program was developed to provide values for the potential and electric field, magnitude, and direction anywhere in the gap. The error in computing the electrode surface potential is about 0.02%. When applied to bundle-conductor lines, this method has no restrictions with regard to spacing between the bundles or height above ground. A study on the effect of varying the line geometrical parameters on the potential and electric field has revealed interesting relations."
"The levels of annoyance to radio reception caused by ac and dc coronas are calculated using the AF power spectra measured at the AF output of a radio-noise meter. The radio annoyance levels. (RAL) and the AF powers are compared with the corresponding quasi-peak readings. The lack of direct correspondence is ascribed to the fact that the QP readings are not sensitive to the randomness in the corona pulse repetition rate which strongly affects both the AF power spectrum and the RAL of corona."
"In order to reduce time and improve the quality of measurements* of EHV power line radio noise, the use of spectrum analyzers and X-Y recording techniques with radio noise meters was investigated. Comparisons were made with the usual manual readings taken simultaneously from radio noise meters used as the standard measuring instruments. With the spectrum analyzer, measurements of radio noise from conductor corona both in rain and fair weather conditions were made in the 1 MHz frequency region. In addition, the interference from a gap-type source was successfully measured over a frequency range from 10 kHz to 1 GHz."
"The method of D-decomposition technique is used for the analysis of steady state stability of a two-machine system with the distant station provided with a fast acting electronic excitation voltage regulator using proportional signals of voltage and current and the first and second derivative of current signals. Analytical results are obtained on a digital computer of the type CDC 6600 for a typical two-machine system. Analysis is given for determining the voltage regulator gains for maximum alternator stability which to a great extent would overcome the often encountered difficulty of setting the regulator gains at commission stage by trial and error, until a good step response under open circuit condition is achieved. The effect of several parameters as also the electro-mechanical transient process of the receiving-end system represented by an equivalent machine of finite capacity on steady state stability of the system is investigated, for properly designing the parameters of the voltage regulator."
 "The effect of supplying a cyclic pulsating load to a 200 BEV nuclear accelerator from the 345 KV interconnected power system in the midwestern United States is studied. The voltage and frequency fluctuations in the transmission system and the excitation of the resonant modes of the generators with their governors and exciters are obtained. This is the first known case of a large accelerator being supplied from a power system without the use of an intervening motor-generator set."

"This paper describes a new test procedure for determining the damage threshold temperature for secondary network cables. Present network cables generally have a maximum damage threshold temperature of 260°C and are protected by class L260 network limiters. The new procedure is considered suitable for evaluating cable designs for damage threshold temperatures up to 340°C, and adaptable for higher temperatures by increasing the rate of cooling of the conduit."
"The essential points of interesting technical matters concerning the design of POF cable and accessories and its installation for Grand Coulee Dam in U.S.A. are discussed. Such difficult problems as extra high oil pressure in lower side pothead, oil drainage from cable, high cable pull tension and cable sliding down were all derived from the high elevation difference and successfully solved."
"The Kingsnorth scheme will be the first to integrate dc transmission within a closely interconnected ac system. The performance requirements of mixed schemes are described and an outline is given of some design features of converter stations, of control and protection aspects, and of the design of the power cable system. Details are given of the developments carried out by one cablemaker, the type test requirements and their successful conclusion."
"This report presents the results of research undertaken with the aim of attaining a better knowledge of flashover mechanism on polluted insulators. Using results already obtained by other authors, the arc development under alternating voltage was studied on an insulating surface of a simple geometry coated with a conducting deposit. The theory established was applied satisfactorily to various types of polluted insulators."
"A reliability model is described which more closely simulates the states of power systems during faults than do the usual \"two-state\" models. This is achieved primarily by modelling the effects of comnponent failures on the system through three-state cycles, which include a state following the fault and another after the failed device is isolated, through switching, for repair. The effects of component maintenance are also incorporated. A sample study is presented, wherein the average outage frequency and duration of a small 115-kV network are calculated. The findings include the observations that, in most cases, the effects of all but the lowest contingency system failures can be neglected; and that coincidences of failures and maintenance are often more frequent causes of system outages than coincidences of faults."

"A general analysis is applied to quarter-wave filters on single-, two-and three-phase power lines. Attenuations of 6dB and 9dB for bandwidths of about 12 and 7 percent have been found for single conductor lines. Performance of filters with resistive and capacitive terminations is discussed. It is concluded that this type of band-attenuation filters presents many attractive features of practical importance."
"Quarter-wave HF filters were originally developed and studied on a single-conductor test line in Japan.1 Subsequently, the filters were installed on a 250-kV, three-phase line and the field results were found very satisfactory. In the present paper an exact general analysis of quarter-wave filters on multiphase lines is developed. The application of this analysis to the single-conductor test lines1 shows a very good agreement between the calculated and measured results. Equations for lines with bundled phase conductors are also derived. It is found that the performance of practical filters on bundled-conductor lines deteriorates with the increase of the equivalent radius of the bundle."
"Injection of noise current from corona sources on bundled subconductors is analyzed. The short-circuit effect of suspension clamps and spacers on the injected currents is determined. It is found that the RI performance of a bundle with insulated subconductors is the same as that of a conventional bundle. A simplified analysis of bundled-conductor lines represented by single-conductor lines is suggested."
"A non-iterative method presented by R. W. Klopfenstein for generating loci of solutions of algebraic equations of the form F(x) = 0 is used to generate solution loci for the load-flow problem. In addition, the method is constrained in such a way as to generate quasi steady-state trajectories under prescribed system changes. The method is equally useful for finding the steady-state stability limit and the number of solutions that exist in the singular point problem. The locations of these multiple singular point solutions are also obtained. Examples of three, four, and six bus systems are included to illustrate these applications of the technique."
"Newton's method [1] is altered to obtain a faster convergence than with the normal approach. The method is derived by comparison with the non-linear programming approach [2]-[4] to the solution of the load flow problem. A control of the convergence process is an additional feature of the proposed algorithm. By means of this control, the method converges for cases when the normal Newton's method diverges. Numerical examples show evidence of these characteristics. The alteration is simple to implement on existing Newton programs."
"The latest of a series of classified lists of power system relay references, begun in 1927, is presented."

"The paper describes the assessment of economic and engineering factors which led to the choice of a sealed windings site-assembled transformer for an installation where, although by present day standards the rating is not large, transport limitations precluded the use of a three-phase transformer of normal design or even a specially designed three-phase light-weight high-loss unit."
"A new method of eliminating ac harmonic current is proposed, which is based on the principle of the magnetic flux compensation in a transformer core. By means of the new method, abnormal harmonics as well as normal harmonics can effectively be dealt with. Considerations on the basic design of the new method are given."
"A theory of the 3-to-n phase transformer using a 3-limb core is presented, based on voltage balance and current balance. The n-phase secondary winding elements form a matrix [Sxy] of order (nX3)."
"The history of the basic concept used in MHD power generation and the progress made in its implementation during the last decade are reviewed briefly. The operating principles of a simple MHD generator are described and the projected improvements in generation efficiency gained from use of such generators in MHD topping cycles are discussed. Some present problem areas -electrical conductivities of the working fluid, magnets and materials problems, gas chemistry, and economics-are described together with prospects for future development."
"This paper describes simulation of power system disturbances and protective relaying performance by means of a digital computer. Line-to-line faults, faults involving ground and open conductors in a power system including both of single-and parallel double-circuit lines are dealt with, that is, voltage distribution under independent or simultaneous occurrence of such faults are calculated. The protective relaying can optionally be simulated by adding or modifying its own subprograms, and the following relayings are herewith detailed as examples: a) Combined phase and directional comparison carrier relaying for extra high voltage system. b) Out-of-step system-split relaying with distance relay of rectangular characteristics. c) Single-and three-phase reclosing systems."
"This paper presents an analytical approch to the construction of power system dynamic equivalents for use in stability calculations and dynamic simulations. The method presented is capable of accurately representing the dynanlical effects of generator field and amortisseur windings, voltage regulators, and speed governors. Experimental evaluation of equivalents constructed by this method is reported in a companion paper."
"This paper describes the development of dynamic power system equivalents for use in stability studies of interconnected systems. The problem of electromechanical equivalencing is formulated, and a method of constructing electromechanical equivalents is described. The performance of these equivalents has been evaluated by a series of computational tests. Theoretical material pertaining to electromechanical equivalencing is presented in a companion paper."
"A method of computing switching transients using a finite difference scheme is presented. The scheme proposed here has the facility of accommodating any termination (including nonlinear elements like lightning arrester). Hence this method is an improvement over the method suggested by Stafford, Evans and Hingorani. Further this method can be used for the determination of the transients arising out of different types of electrical disturbances in the system i.e. component flashover, faults, lightning strokes etc. The stability analysis of the scheme proposed and the computational aspects of the procedure are discussed."
"Thyristor circuits have been satisfactorily applied as voltage regulating systems using d-c pilot and main exciters on large hydroelectric generators. Duty cycle modulation of thyristor switching circuits using capacitance commutation replaces rheostatic regulator control. Fail safe design withcommutation failure detection provides high reliability. Included are convenient remote voltage adjustment without intervening motors or switches, supplementary control and rapid voltage reduction for internal generator faults. Functional diagrams and descriptions are given which indicate circuit design and performance."
"This paper discusses the improved stability performance offered by a low rise time, high response excitation system to be installed on Unit No. 1 at the Diablo Canyon Site. Such an excitation system is provided by a low time constant rotating exciter with minor loop current feedback."
"A high initial response excitation system retaining the advantages of the absence of commutators, collectors and brushes while responding with the speed of an electronic exciter has been developed. Calculated performance of this system has been firmed by factory tests. With the exciter loaded, the excitation system achieved 95% of ceiling voltage in 0.016 seconds following a 10% step change in the voltage regulator sensing signal. In addition to the high initial response capability, the excitation system also includes supplementary feedback control for improving the small signal dynamic performance characteristic of the exciter. With the addition of feedback, the effective exciter time constant is reduced by a factor of thirty compared to its value without feedback. The tests confirm that low time constants and high initial response can readily be attained in an excitation system which includes a brushless exciter with non-controlled rectifiers."
"A field test program is described which was used to evaluate and then to adjust the 33 power system stabilizers installed on the Pacific Gas and Electric Company's system. Also included is a comparison of the results of these tests with those of a digital computer simulation."
"The concept, development and construction of a turbogenerator, cooled exclusively by water, is the basis for this paper. The design and operation of a 300 MVA unit is discussed and performance figures are given."
"After indicating the importance of the role played by pumped-storage hydroelectric plants in Italian power production the author discusses ENEL's construction program relating to this type of plant."
"Power system stability can be improved by sudden changes in the electric power network such as the insertion of braking resistors, generator dropping or load shedding. A unified treatment of optimum switching is presented by considering the switching instants to be elements of a generalized control vector. Dynamic optimization is then applied to determine optimum switching instants."
"The optimal output feedback control of a synchronous machine, consisting of constant output feedback gains from only those states which are physically available for measurement, is considered in this paper. An integral quadratic performance index of outputs and controller inputs is minimized for impulse type disturbances occurring in the system. This gives a physically realizable control system which optimally \"stabilizes\" the excitation and input power to the synchronous machine. Numerical examples are included to show the application of the theory to a thermal and a hydraulic machine equipped with static exciters, and connected to an infinite bus. It is found that it is desirable to control a synchronous machine using both exciter and input power control gates with both power angle and speed fed back. A reduction in the value of the index of performance by a factor as large as 66 may be achieved using this control configuration instead of the conventional control configuration."
"An optimal excitation control for the stability of synchronous machines is found in a closed form using Pontryagin's minimum principle. While the optimal control is bang bang, in practice it is necessary to compromise with normal voltage regulator action to produce a sub-optimal control. The time required for stabilization is slightly increased by this. The results obtained for the single machine- infinite bus case indicate that such control provides major benefits in removing transients."
"A previous paper (1), has shown that a second order optimising algorithm can be applied to a simple model of a turbo-alternator to determine the optimum control inputs under transient conditions. This paper extends the application of this algorithm to a more detailed model including exciter and governor control loops. It is shown that suitable controls can be found to improve the transient performance of a large turbo-alternator, even in the presence of practical constraints on the control system."
"Methods which have been proposed for increasing the margin of stability in large generators generally act by controlling the generator electrical power output. A more direct control of the stability can be achieved by regulating the power input to the turbine. Simultaneous control of the field excitation and the turbine"
"The interdependency of rotor angle oscillations of synchronous generators which are situated in close electrical proximity can be very important under transient conditions. The approximation of representing a group of generators, say in one power station, by one equivalent machine for large system studies may be invalidated by such interaction."
"The conference paper listed has been accepted for IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems and is now open for written discussion until November 5, 1971."
"The SF6 gas circuit breaker is getting a major position in the field of circuit breakers because of its excellent performance. On the way to putting them to practical use the authors made investigations to solve the several problems encountered, such as the control of moisture content in the gas, liquefaction, control of gas leakage, selection of O-ring materials, etc. This paper describes the results of these investigations and presents the solutions and counter- measures applied in practice."
"Determination of ionization coefficients in SF6 and other electronegative gases from ionization current growth measurements is discussed, and an expression is derived for the influence of field nonuniformity upon the ionization current. The field distribution for Bruce-profiled electrodes in a typical experimental setup is calculated on a digital computer. The effect of the calculated deviation from uniformity of the axial field between the electrodes upon current growth in SF6 is determined. It is concluded that the length of the test gap should always be less than half of the normally recommended maximum gap length for Bruce-electrodes to avoid errors caused by field nonuniformity and asymmetry."
"A new method of approximating a distributed wedgeshaped transmission line by a lumped line is presented. This line is easier to build because all the capacitors have the same value. This approximation should be useful when the simulation of time varying fields is required for studying Eddy-current problems in non-linear magnetic cylinders. Comparisons made between the exact solution, the classical lumped line and this new approach show that this new approach is more accurate for a given number of sections."
"This paper presents a computational procedurer for the on-line optimal rescheduling of power generation. Rescheduling is used to correct an unreliable system operating state and bring a potentially dangerous condition into a secure operating state. Sensitivity parameters are the basis of the model, and linear programming formulation is developed to solve the optimal rescheduling problem. The constraints on the variables are naturally included in this practical method. A small power-network illustrates the application of the method."
"This paper presents a technique using the Gauss-Seidel iterative approach for the analysis of power systems which contain series compensated lines. This approach includes the effect of system dissymmetries due to a single unbalanced fault and due to a single or -two phase series capacitor short circuit caused by the excessive fault currents. Single phase to ground, two phases and two phase to ground fault studies of a series compensated power system are included."
"Simultaneous faults of common configuration may be described mathematically in terms of two-port network theory with one port for terminating the network at each fault point. Combining the sequence networks, with appropriate phase shifts, will then permit-direct solution of the network voltages and currents in a general way. This approach to solving for simultaneous fault quantities is very orderly and makes solution by hand computation or by computer more straightforward than previous methods."
"The solution of an electric circuit problem is only valid if the circuit elements have been validly modelled. The iron-cored coil is a common nonlinear circuit element, especially in power system circuits, where the iron core is laminated grain-oriented silicon-iron sheet. This paper attempts to show that eddy-current loss modelling in such a core is at least as important as hysteresis loss modelling, and demonstrates the accuracy of linear modelling of the eddy-current effect. If the circuit analyst has confidence in this complete model he can then decide which aspects of the model can be ignored with impunity when studying such circuit phenomena as ferroresonance, subharmonics and inrush current."
 "The trend in turbine-generator characteristics as unit sizes become larger is in an adverse direction from the standpoint of power system stability. Results of specific studies as well as a general rule of thumb for evaluating this effect are given. The effectiveness of independent pole switching and other control measures available to the system planner are shown."
"This paper covers an analytical method for transient behavior of a synchronous machine with shunt-connected thyristor exciter under power system faults such as line-to-line and three-phase short-circuit faults, considering performances of the thyristor converter and characteristics of the excitation control system."
"A great deal of attention is being given to the problem of using feed-back signals in the excitation systems. It has been shown that the transient stability limits improve if signals besides the terminal voltage deviation are fed to the excitation system. A number of different signals based on the rates of change of voltage, current, power and rotor angle have been either tried or suggested. It appears that during the next few years the feed-back signals will play a very important role in the design of excitation systems."
"The calculation of electromagnetic transients is applied to an impulse generator circuit of n stages with the overvoltage behaviour of the spark-gaps taken into account. Measurements of the impulse voltage by a damped-capacitive divider and of the subsequent firing of the sphere gaps by streak photography with an image converter camera illustrate good agreement between equivalent model and actual circuit."
"The calculation of the resistance values necessary to generate a particular double exponential impulse shape or the calculation of the two time constants from the resistance and capacitance values is a difficult and time consuming problem if done rigorously. In order to simplify these calculations, an approximation method has been developed which can be carried to any degree of accuracy by an iterative procedure. For normal purposes the initial calculations, done with a slide rule, will yield results of a sufficiently high accuracy."
"An excellent characteristic resistor divider was developed by minimizing the size of the resistor itself and installing it in insulating oil."
"In high-voltage technology, plasma physics and power electronics low-ohmic resistors are frequently employed to measure high, rapidly changing currents. Their voltage drop is adversely affected by stray inductances and skin effect. A more complete analysis of low- ohmic tubular type and squirrel cage type resistors including such effects is presented. This paper also develops a compensation network of passive electronic components that permits improved measurement of high energy impulse currents."
"Experiments have been designed and performed on a sphere-plate triggered air spark-gap with the purpose of separating the factors affecting dc breakdown process, and investigating the physical aspect of the phenomenon. Measurements of minimum break- down voltages and corresponding time-lags have been carried out with all the influencing factors of triggering spark present, as well as with each factor acting alone. The results of the experimental analysis have lead to certain conclusions regarding the influence of each affecting factor, of the polarities of main and triggering gaps, and of triggering voltage on breakdown characteristics and on gap behaviour more generally."
  "An isolated noise source such as a cracked insulator on a multiconductor overhead EHV transmission line produces an electric field adjacent to the line by two separate paths. One is the transmission of the noise voltage along the line causing a lateral field and the other is the direct radiation from the source acting as a dipole antenna. The theory of natural modes has been applied to determine the line field while ordinary antenna theory has been used in the determination of the antenna field. The calculations have been carried out with a digital computer for a single circuit horizontal line although the program developed is general and applicable in the analysis of a practical line of any configuration and make up. It has been shown that the transmission line functions as an induction umbrella where the line field is strong and outside which the antenna field is predominant."
"This paper reports positive switching impulse flashover characteristics of thin wire-plane gaps. Flashover tests were made under both conditions that switching impulses were added with or without ac or dc corona occurring previously. Flashover distances were up to 4 m, and ac or dc bias voltage was 400 kV crest."
"The probabilistic approach of the Monte Carlo method has been applied to the electro-geometric model used for the analysis of frequency of lightning strokes and shielding failures on overhead lines. This approach has enabled theoretical studies to be made of how these parameters are influenced by conductor sag, variations in terrain, and the presence of trees surrounding the line route."
"This paper presents test results supplementing recently published information on the switching-surge performance of UHV transmission line insulation."
"This is a Progress Report on the Guide for EHV Transformer External Insulation Coordination concepts and test requirements for units rated 345 kV and above when applied on effectively grounded systems. The publication of this report for study and general information was requested by the Transformers Committee of IEEE."
"The, behavior of corona and the resulting damage in oil-filled insulation were investigated. internal corona should be divided into intrinsic oil corona and bubble corona. The former is far more intense than air corona. The magnitude of the individual charge usually exceeds 1 x 104 pC. Insulation damage barely appears under lx 105 pC. This fact was deduced from investigations of insulation models and experience with actual transformers. With some margin, a charge in excess of 1 x 104 pC can be expected to produce damaging corona. This work will be helpful in interpreting corona test results, as well as in improving procedures for testing corona in EHV transformer's. Some proposals for testing transformers for the presence of corona are presented."
"Location of corona or \"partial discharges\" in transformers can be an extremely difficult, costly and time-consuming process, especially if disassembly is required. The present state-of-the-art is such that a variety of sonic and electrical corona location techniques are employed, none of which is completely adequate, but with experience and patience, corona sources can be found."
"Interest in the circuit approach to the analysis of electric power apparatus has been increasing rapidly over the past decade. In academic circles it has almost supplanted the field based approach, the classical texts being mainly out of print and replaced by a wide variety of texts with phrases such as \"dynamic circuit theory\" or \"generalized machine theory\" in their titles. This wholehearted acceptance which came about for a variety of reasons has however not been reflected in industrial circles. Here, despite considerable interest fostered bv the success of the circuit approach in some areas of current interest, such as the stability of inverter fed machines, a more cautious attitude prevails. This is natural since the paramount industrial need is to provide numerical solutions to practical problems involving apparatus which natentlv does not fit the standard simplifying assumptions of the circuit approach. To generate confidence in the solutions it is necessary to investigate the appli cabilitv of these assumptions and to establish analyrtic nrocedures appronriate to the problems encountered."
"The purpose of this paper is to fill a gap which exists in the \"textbook\" theory of dc machines. The paper shows that the usual expression for dc machine torque can be obtained from the direct application of the principle of virtual work to the machine, making the traditional assumptions. The method provides additional benefits in that it demonstrates the reluctance torque which results from the saliency of the field structure and shows that compensating windings have no effect on the torque under the assumed linear conditions."
"The magnetic field distribution in saturated iron parts of electric machines is defined by a nonlinear quasi-Poisson equation. Solution of this equation is equivalent to minimization of a nonlinear energy functional. A recent paper has proposed approximate minimization by means of a finite element method, using triangular finite elements and a quadratically convergent iteration scheme. This new method is now applied to a 5 KW d-c machine, whose no-load and on-load characteristics are predicted and compared with experimental measurements. Good agreement is obtained. Since the pole axis is not an axis of magnetic symmetry under load, a periodicity condition is introduced to relate all magnetic vector potentials to those one pole pitch away. This condition is enforced by means of a special connection matrix, whose derivation is shown in the paper. An automatic plotting program has been developed for graphical plotting of the flux distributions, and several field plots for the machine are shown."
"This paper considers the problem of calculating the eddy current losses in a rectangular conducting slab in a magnetic field which would be uniform if the slab were not present. The length axis is perpendicular to the uniform field, but there may be an angular displacement' about this axis. A rigorous numerical solution is obtained for an infinite length slab. An approximate correction is given for finite length. The results are presented in the form of a simple formula, and two curves of correction factors. The methods used are generally applicable to eddy current problems."
"The authors have already reported some of their studies concerning the short-circuit strength of transformer windings. They have also gained advanced findings with the following laborious studies."
"An idealized model for heat transfer problems of an underground distribution transformer, where the unit is placed in an uncovered vault, is studied. The work emphasizes the steady state operation of transformers, in which the time rate of heat generation is constant and the temperature distribution depends only on spat1al coordinates. Such an approach much simplifies the numerical calculations, while providing important inf ormation concerning various factors which affect the temperature distribution. It is shown that Increasing the vault size, in particular the diameter, has the most pronounced effect in reducing the transformer temperature rise. Other factors such as thermal conductivities of vault and surrounding soil, and the emissivities of tank and vault surface, have only minor effect."

"Criteria for achieving area net interchange and system frequency schedules with net interchange tie-line bias control in all areas of an interconnected system are briefly reviewed. Equations defining deviations from schedules, as well as consequent inadvertent interchange and time error accumulations when these criteria are not fulfilled, are derived. These lead to suggested control techniques based on adding, on a system wide basis, coordinated inadvertent interchange and time error correction factors to area control error computations. It is believed that such techniques would improve the control of bulk power transfers."
"Frequency transients on electric power systems induce a response which is a complex function of system characteristics. This paper describes a digital data-gathering scheme and gives an analysis of the characteristic response obtained from a typical power system. Digital data-gathering permits analysis of transient response on a greatly expanded time scale and separation of the components for individual study. System response characteristics thus derived should contribute to improved power system control and stability when incorporated into on-line control computers."
"Future turbine-generator unit designs, particularly for the larger ratings, are expected to have greater generator reactances and lower unit inertias. Transient stability limits are determined for the future designs in terms of critical fault clearing times for faults on the high voltage transmission lines at the power plant substation. Transient stability limits of the future designs are compared with representative existing generating unit designs. Stability performance of future turbine-generator designs will be very similar to existing designs when considering their respective breaker failure (backup) relay system capabilities. Approximate gains in transient stability critical fault clearing times are also listed when applying various feasible stability control techniques."
"This paper covers the development of LC equivalent circuits for the simulation of a lossless short circuited transmission line. A total of eight different equivalent circuits are obtained through the application of circuit theory and residue calculus. Each of the circuits has its advantages and disadvantages depending upon the desired application. In this paper, the equivalent circuits are rated by their ability to simulate a short circuited transmission line in the testing of circuit breakers."
"Single-pole switching is selected for a radial 500-kV line which connects a l, 278-MVA generator into the transmission system. Line protective relays providing selective tripping and special compensation assisting with secondary arc current extinction are described. System planning criteria and design concepts for 500-kV single-pole switching are verified for the first time by staged fault tests conducted on an operating 500-kV system."
"The implementation of a new three phase travelling wave program is discussed. The unique feature of this program is the use of Thevenin equivalent circuit for representation of line terminal conditions. This allows the use of linear or non-linear differential equations at any line terminal. A new shorthand matrix notation for balanced matrices is used to solve the terminal differential equation for an inductive termination. Parametric results are presented showing the influence of the transmission line X0/X1 on surge levels and effective line-to-ground surge impedance."
"The theoretical transient solution of multiphase transmission line propagation is reviewed by comparison of the Fourier and Laplace transform techniques applicable to this problem. The results show that the Fourier transform technique is more general, because it can include consideration of frequency dependent transmission line parameters and frequency dependent eigenvectors. The Laplace transform technique is applied to a lossy, completely transposed, transmission line using a new shorthand matrix notation for balanced matrices in the analysis. These results show that modal analysis canbe used in the balanced transmission line analysis. A discussion of possible simulation techniques are discussed and it is concluded that further work is required in this area to adequately incorporate attenuation and distortion on long duration switching surges."
"The load-frequency control problem for interconnected systems is considered from the viewpoint of optimal stochastic system theory. A control algorithm is developed which provides improved power system performance in both large and small signal modes of operation. An especially attractive feature of the proposed control scheme is that it requires as inputs only the variables currently used, i. e., frequency deviations and scheduled interchange deviations. The classical two-area power system is used as a base system for comparative studies relating the response of an interconnected power system using the new control algorithm to the response obtained using conventional control strategy."
"This paper considers the problems of choosing the stabilizing structures of power system generators with forced excitation control reliably ensuring steady-state stability of the system operation. The synthesis method outlined for this purpose makes it possible to determine (with minimum stability calculations) both the generator operational condition parameters and the orders of their derivatives to be used for the control stabilization."
"The paper applies the method of D-decomposition technique for optimizing the derivative gain settings of the excitation voltage regulators of a power station for best steady state stability condition, i. e. for maximum alternator stability and best transient response for small perturbations. A suitable digital program based on the D-decomposition technique has been written for a typical two-machine system to obtain the best values of the regulator derivative gains for different operating conditions of the system which are necessary for the future design of an on-line controlled AVR*. The nonlinear change of the derivative gain settings is also compared with the usual constant gain settings from stability limit and transient response aspects. The effect of several parameters such as the electro-mechanical transient process of the receiving-end system and certain AVR feed back signals e. g. the first and second derivatives of voltage and the proportional signal of current on the quality of transient response is also investigated."
"A new and efficient control scheme is proposed for the real-time control of system voltage and reactive power control and the conventional computational algorithms are reviewed from the point of view of on-line centralized control on a real-time basis. A simplified linear model describing the voltage and reactive power control characteristics is given which is conveniently constructed for the purpose of minimizing the transmission losses under the constraint of the voltage settling condition."
"An efficient computational algorithm is presented for the real-time control of system voltage and reactive power on the basis of a simplified linear model. A modified version of the complex method of Box is used for the minimization of bus voltage deviation in the first phase of optimization and a numerical search technique for the reduction of transmission losses due to reactive power flows in the second phase. The numerical example for a sample practical system is also given."
"This paper presents the results of a recent study sponsored by Philadelphia Electric Company. The primary objectives were to reduce the size of a typical Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) power plant control room and to provide a more efficient operator interface with the process. Conventional \"hard-wired\" instrumentation and computer-driven cathode ray tubes (CRTs) were used to implement the functional requirements in each of the four alternatives established for study. The results were conclusive indicating that the study objectives can be met within the realm of current technology."
"As steam turbine generator units increase in rating, their inertia constants tend to decrease and their reactance constants to increase, thus aggravating the power system transient stability problem. There is also a tendency for the complete unit to take longer to restart and reload when unscheduled disconnection from the system takes place. Counter measures are needed and may be available within the power plant. A study of these measures was made by the authors acting as a Working Group of NewEngland's NEPLAN Planning Committee's System Design Task Force. The paper presents the Working Group's findings as widely supported by the major utilities in New England."
"Duke Power Company installs a plant computer for each new generating unit which is called an Operator Aid Computer. Application at Oconee Nuclear Station, which is Duke's first commercial nuclear station has required new functions. The differences in the application at Oconee and future nuclear stations are compared to the functions required at previous fossil- fired stations."
"In spite of licensing delays resulting from public concern over environmental effects, and notwithstanding sharply escalated manufacturing and construction costs, nuclear power appears to be a promising long term solution to the Nation's problem of electric power supply."
"It is shown how hybrid computers formed from special- purpose analog modules and process-control- type digital computers can be used to solve power system load flows more rapidly than by digital computation alone. For a 181-bus system, a particular hybrid computer has been built that requires about 20 seconds for each solution as compared with 30 minutes for an all-digital solution with the same computer."
"In the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in kVA ratings of large turbine-generators, accompanied by a parallel increase in the electromagnetic forces acting on the stator windings. This has created an industry-wide problem of providing a stator winding support system which is capable of adequately restraining these forces to avoid impairment of machine reliability."
"For stability studies of large power systems, accurate representation of the synchronous machine is required. As pointed out by Canayl, the conventional equivalent circuits for synchronous machines do not give accurate computed field voltage and current values. He suggested several circuits and showed good agreement between his test and calculated results. His circuit parameters were calculated from design."
"Simulation programs for electromagnetic transients must provide models for lightning arresters, transformer saturation, circuit breakers and other nonlinear and time-varying effects. This paper describes techniques for keeping the solution time in networks with such elements as low as possible, by using the compensation method or network equivalents."
 "Two contamination test methods have been examined for the difference in assumptions used as the basis of each method. Dynamic surface impedance of insulators in a slow-wetting condition is remarkably influenced by the voltage across the insulator unit, which causes nonlinearity of insulation strength with insulator length. On the other hand, the surface condition can be represented as resistance in wet contaminant tests. This difference in surface condition naturally leads to disagreement in the results. It has been concluded to be of limited utility to discuss the order of merit for several insulators with different test methods, since any contamination method cannot simulate all aspects of this problem."
"Because of the growing problem caused by insulator contamination due to both industrial pollution and natural deposits, a Working Group of the Lightning and Insulator Subcommittee was formed to study the problem. The first objective was to determine the extent of the problem in the U. S. and Canada, and to determine the various kinds of contaminants and the most severe weather conditions that cause transmission line outages. A survey was conducted by sending questionnaires to 90 utilities. A total of 309 case histories were reported. This report summarizes the answers to questions regarding contaminants and insulator types. It also sheds some light on the preventive measures most frequently undertaken by the utilities and the degree of success of each action."
"A new method of integrating the nonlinear differential systems with wide eigenvalue range encountered in power system transient studies is developed. A state transition matrix is employed and a very efficient procedure for its calculation is included. For typical problems this integration method has permitted step sizes a factor of 100 larger than conventional numerical integration algorithms without loss of accuracy or significant increase in computing time per step."
"The state equations of Kron's primitive machine (KPM) are derived. In turn, the describing equations of the classical energy converters that have time varying coefficients are transformed to corresponding equivalent state equations. These state equations have time independent coefficients and describe the two and three phase primary (with damping windings) synchronous energy converters and the two and three phase primary induction energy converters, all referred to a stationary d-q reference frame. In effect, the state equations describe KPM-equivalents of the above-mentioned devices. The parameters of these equivalents are functions of the real parameters of the physical devices as they are used in practice."
"This paper describes a numerical technique for identifying the pertinent transfer functions of multi-machine power systems. The method described herein will enable the system analyst to form a compact model of a complicated linearized multi-variable system with a minimum amount of manual algebra. The state space form of system representation is used to obtain the required transfer functions which in turn could be used to perform studies on any of the plant controllers. An example from the area of power system control is used to illustrate the efficiency of this particular technique."
"The extensive range in time duration (from microseconds to seconds) of power line distrubances which might affect the operation of data processing equipment requires monitors with characteristics not generally available. The operating and detection characteristics of two types of monitors specifically developed to monitor these disturbances are described. The first is an oscilloscope-automatic camera monitor called an \"analog monitor.\" The second is a small, two-unit \"digital printout monitor.\" Data obtained from the use of these monitors is also presented."
"This paper deals with a novel method of braking induction machines. Diodes are connected in series with the primary or secondary machine circuits as the phase sequence of the supply to the primary is reversed and rapid braking to standstill or a low crawl speed is produced. Effective braking also results when diodes are connected in circuit, without reversal of supply phase sequence, if the load torque or the secondary resistance is above a critical, minimum level."
"In this paper experimental results are presented which indicate that flexible resistive cryogenic EHV cables employing a liquid nitrogen-impregnated dielectric wrap will withstand values of electric stress under lightning impulse and switching surge conditions comparable to those achievable in EHV oil/paper cables. To simulate the geometry of a cable, each test specimen consisted of a tape-wrapped insulation layer between concentric cylindrical electrodes (with stress cones added at the ends of the sample). The samples included fifteen wrapped with spunbonded olefin fiber tapes, three wrapped with high-density cellulose EHV cable paper, and for comparison purposes, a liquid cell with concentric cylindrical electrodes. The data are consistent with observations on similar insulation systems at 60 Hz since the wrapped dielectrics impregnated with liquid nitrogen withstood a substantially higher electric stress under these conditions than the liquid nitrogen alone."
"Many reports are published in which the potential distribution of DC cable is calculated by the insulation resistance theory."
"Development of Compressed-Gas-Insulated transmission lines for voltages of 138 to 500 kV is described. Design, manufacture and installation are presented. Dielectric and mechanical tests data are given. A 230 kV single-phase outdoor test line of 230-ft length has been installed and voltage and current tests have been initiated. Thermal data for currents up to 3000 A are reported."
"In a recent survey taken among more than 50 electric utilities and power pools, more than 30 percent expressed a need for load flow and stability programs that would be capable of representing more than 2000 buses and 3000 branches. In fact, more than 20 percent indicated a need for 3000 bus programs within the next two years, and some wanted 4000 bus programs. When using methods for network solution such as the Newton-Raphson method, the amount of computer memory required by a 2000 bus program, even when sparsity is effectively exploited, is near the limit of very large computers. There is, then, an obvious need for tearing techniques that can be applied to such solution methods as the Newton-Raphson method, the Y-bus method, the factorized Z-bus method, and other equivalent methods."
"A program has been developed for on-line steam unit dispatch that results in the minimizing of Nitrogen Oxide emissions. A unique mathematical representation of the steam generating units coupled with a Newton-Raphson convergence technique for dispatch produces base points and participation factors for any load level and any unit configuration. Emission reductions and corresponding cost increases are compared to standard economic dispatch."
"This paper reports upon the development of new multi-area dispatch algorithms, their implementation and use in system operations."
"The application of statistical methods to the field of cable dielectric strength is discussed on the basis of experimental results."
"By comparing the variations in AC breakdown stress of butyl rubber-insulated cable with that of cross-linked, polyethylene- insulated cable, the aspects of deterioration caused by impulse voltages were investigated."
"Internal discharges were studied in a cylindrical cavity. Discharges were found to tend to be localized or fractionized from the measurements of apparent charge of maximum discharges, repetition rate of discharge pulses and inner-surface resistivity in cavities and from the observation on discharges with a microscope. Phenomena of internal discharges are easily influenced by physical properties of the inner-surface of a cavity, especially the electrical resistivity to be subject to change due to the discharge themselves."
"The main reason why high voltage plastic power cables lead to the dielectric breakdown is considered the insulation deterioration which is brought about by partial discharges within voids and other anomalies. We have taken various measures in order to suppress these partial discharges. Then we got an idea that when some semi-conductive organic material is blended in the insulation material, the surface resistivity of voids in the insulation and between the insulation and semi-conductive layer is reduced. Our study based on this idea produced effectual results. This paper describes the theoretical analysis, fundamental experiments and application experiments to cables and cable joints."
"The state equations for the generator mode of operation of dynamic systems with time varying coefficients are obtained. These equations have coefficients that are time independent and are functions of the parameters used in practice to describe their corresponding physical devices. These state equations are represented by a state equation diagram and provide an analysis of the corresponding devices on either the stationary or the arbitrarily rotating d-q reference frame."
"The presence of bad data points may severely degrade the performance of any of the power system static state estimators currently being proposed. This paper discusses a BDS (bad data suppression) estimator which is based on a non-quadratic cost function but which reduces to the weighted least squares estimator in the absence of bad data. In the presence of bad data, the BDS algorithm provides state estimates comparable to those provided by the weighted least squares method when all data is good. Computer storage and computational requirements and convergence time are equivalent for the BDS and weighted least squares estimators."
"This paper sets forth the state variable formulation for the representation of the dynamics of the motor mode of operation of different types of energy converters. State equation diagrams with cross-coupled inputs and outputs, constituting nonlinear conditions, represent these state equations. The developed electromagnetic torque em of the electrical state equation diagram is the input of the mechanical state diagramτ, the outputs of which are then fed into the electrical state equation diagram. The angular velocity ωr affects the coefficients of the electrical state equations. The angular displacement θr transforms the electrical state variables into terminal variables in each device."
"In this paper the parameter plane method is applied to delineate regions of absolute and relative stability of a load frequency control system. Different governor systems are considered and the stability regions are shown in the appropriate variable parameter planes. The curves of relative stability are useful in studying the effect of parameter variations and also in the selection of governor settings for a desired transient response. All facets of this study are illustrated by a typical example."
"A two-level controller for interconnected power plants is discussed. Each plant has a first level local optimal or suboptimal controller. The second level of control is an intervention control performed by a central co-ordinator. If a sudden system disturbance causes the system angular acceleration to exceed preset tolerances a priority interrupt to the central co-ordinator initiates intervention control. Angular velocity deviations of all plants are transmitted to the co-ordinator. This data is used to generate coefficient data for each plant. On receiving its coefficient data, each plant generates a local second-level intervention control which augments first level local control."
"This paper presents the results of basic research on controversial problems caused during the course of development of a direct evaporative cooling system using water. This is a new, but extremely effective, cooling method for turbine generator rotor windings. Also presented are a series of test results obtained from tests conducted on rotors equivalent to 200 MVA."
"A brief historical review of the use of static capacitors and synchronous condensers for regulating power system voltage is made. Comparative costs are shown which demonstrate that the large synchronous condenser has a place on the large EHV power system. Application of the 345 mva fully water-cooled synchronous condenser on the American Electric Power System is described."
"The paper describes the development of synchronous condensers using air and hydrogen as cooling mediums and the factors which led to the adoption of direct water cooling for the 345 MVA synchronous condenser for the Dumont Station of the American Electric Power System. Technical data, design and construction details and testing methods and results are presented."
"Worldwide research and development of the high-voltage thy- ristor converter has been actively promoted recently. In order to apply the thyristor converter to a present-day power system, it is necessary to develop a control and protective system suitable for the system and to study an operating ability when troubles develop in the converter and power system. To solve this problem, we manufactured a HVDC simulator by using a thyristor converter simulating a practical converter and we newly developed the control and protective system."
"A technique is presented for calculating the harmonic interactive behaviour between HVdc and ac systems. The ac system is represented by discrete impedances at harmonic frequencies, and the calculations involve the repeated iteration of a large computer program representative of the interaction of generated ac harmonic currents with the ac system impedances and filters. Examples of computed harmonic conditions are presented, and the degree to which the harmonic behavior is dependent on the ac system impedances and filters is discussed for both normal and abnormal harmonics."
"The use of earth as the return path for the current presents a highly attractive aspect of power transmission by direct current (HVDC). This is not without raising considerable controversy on the possible corrosion and communication disturbances to existing pipe, cable and other systems buried in the earth. Since a close relationship exists between these various disturbing effects and the local values of the potential and potential gradient, a knowledge of these quantities are of prime importance in evaluating the feasibility and performance of this power transmission technique."
"A method of calculating turn-on over- voltages in a high-voltage dc valve, as well as a computer program to perform the calculations, is presented. The effect of critical system and valve parameters on turn-on over- voltages is shown through results of calculations for a representative thyristor valve. The techniques presented are a powerful tool for valve design, and for optimization of system and valve parameters."

"The feasibility of a more general application of toroidally -wound deflection yokes (combined vertical and horizontal toroidal coils) to commercial color television receivers has been studied: considerable progress through developments based on research into coil-design permutations and the limitations of previous applications has been achieved to date. Much greater manufacturing consistency is noted in the developmental toroidal yoke described than was previously obtainable with \"saddle\"-wound yokes; other features of the yoke described include a compact core, more economic use of wire, rapid adjustment of convergence in a receiver, characteristics favoring the trend toward low -impedance sweep systems inherent in solid-state television receivers, and applicabi lity to both in-line and delta-gun array picture tubes. Simplified supporting hardware is used with the new yokes. It is anticipated that, with further development, the toroidal yoke may be well become the standard of the industry."
"Large screen solid state color television receivers present some problems which could be neglected in less critical areas such as monochrome and small screen sets. Probably the most important is the greater energy which the scan transistors are required to switch."
"Semiconductor diodes are useful for a variety of control functions in electronic circuits. Improved performance and efficiency as well as savings in cost and weight are often achieved when mechanical or gaseous control devices are replaced by semiconductor devices."
"In the last few years, significant efforts have been made to incorporate integrated circuits in signal processing sections of a television receiver. Attempts to obtain frequency selectivity by using active RC filters have not been too successful."
 "Contrast (numerically) is what you make it ! By this, we mean that there are many variables involved in producing the final image on a color receiver. Some of these are controllable and some are not. The \"number\" used to express contrast can vary over wide limits, depending on the measurement techniques involved in determining the number itself. This is why the method used in obtaining a given set of contrast data must be spelled out carefully if the data are to be fully understood. We are presenting, here, a technique which we have found to be useful for rating the contrast characteristics of color tubes under monochrome mode of operation. No discussion will be made of contrast due to color differences between areas in a color image. This is a field by itself and well beyond the scope of this paper."
"A wide selection of Integrated Circuit (IC) TV Sound Systems is available in the marketplace today. This paper has been prepared to aid the Television manufacturer in choosing the Sound System (or Systems) that best suits his requirements."
"It has been comon practice to use high voltage regulation circuits in higher quality color TV sets to improve performance. This was usually done with high voltage shunt regulator tubes which provide the horizontal. scan and high voltage part of the TV set with a constant load regardless of the brightness of the picture. A common problem has been excessive x-radiation when these tubes fail and the high voltage tends to reach very high values at low brightness. Therefore, a number of feedback circuits were designed to make the set conform with the radiation standards in case of a regulator tube failure. Figure 1 shows such a system. The feedback loop is drawn in heavier lines."
"Much has been written about the transistor Stability Factor S and what it can do to protect a circuit from the variables of Beta and temperature. It is in the application of the basic principles to a particular circuit that the question arises, \"What value of S shall I use?\". This paper will attempt to clarify this point."

 "The power handling capability of any transistor is limited by its peak junction temperature. Equally as important as the more familiar ICBO thermal runaway is a second, thermally related, phenomenon called forward biased second breakdown (S/B). Much has been written on S/B (see Ref. 1 for a thorough description and bibliography) but it is sufficient here to say that S/B is a potentially destructive phenomena that can occur in any bipolar transistor when the energy absorbed exceeds a critical value and creates a hot spot within the pellet. If the temperature of the hot spot is left unchecked, it will eventually cause the space-charge layer to collapse resulting in the transistor assuming a low resistance state."
"The change of the IF response with gain (usually called the \"pole shifting IF\") has been a well-accepted practice in the design of the tube television receivers, both color and black and white. The tube parameter employed most often was the change of the input impedance with gm in a pentode tube. This change was predictably controlled to give the desired results."
"The lack of integrated inductors is a significant drawback in the design of frequency-selective integrated circuits for broadcast and TV receivers. In many cases, a partial integration of the receiver sub-systems is possible by combining all the active elements in a monolithic package and leaving the tuning coils and the inductors external to the circuit. However, this compromise solution often represents only a marginal advantage over the conventional design. For integrated receiver circuits, phase-lock techniques present an alternate design approach which eliminates the need for inductors1. In such an approach, one uses a phase-locked loop ( PLL) system to perfonn the selectivity and the demodulation functions in a receiver. A detailed analysis of the PLL system as a tracking filter and FM demodulator has been extensively covered in the literaturel-3 and will not be repeated here."
"Large Scale Integration (LSI) and Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOS-FETs) have been successfully combined to produce a monolithic integrated circuit developed specifically for a consumer product. The product, an AM/FM: Digital Clock radio (Figs. 1 and 2) utilizes a silicon chip (Fig. 3) approximately 1/8 inch square to operate the totally electronic timer portion of the product. This paper will discuss only the electronic timer portion of the clock radio."
 "The NTSC color television system works: millions of color receivers are operating, almost all of which produce colored pictures. The system does not work perfectly: the inidustry receives complairits of poor and unstable color reproduction, and a massive program of corrective actions is being undertaken by the broadcasting half of the industry. It is expected that the existing problems will be minimized in a few years so that the average quality of broadcast signals will improve greatly. The point will be reached where the great nmajority of transmitted signals will liave quite similar colorimetry, burst phase-to-fleshtone angle, burst/chroma/video ampli. tude ratios, and sychronization waveforms. Will all color receivers then produce sinmilar pictures? It appears that they may not. Several reasons wh1y not will be presented here."
"Using thick film and novel substrate technology, 17\" black and white line operated TV receiver set has been fabricated by six hybrid integrated circuits."
"Previous analyses of the automatic frequency control (AFC) pull-in phenomenon in television horizontal deflection systmes have not yielded results that would permit the quantitative determination of the pull-in range during circuit design. This paper describes phase-plane analysis of this phenomenon that clarifies the relationship between the pull-in range and the various AFC circuit parameters."

    "This paper describes a novel IC consisting of two independent small signal amplifiers and a multistage voltage and temperature compensated power amplifier capable of delivering 0.5 watt. Because of the great veisatility of this IC, a variety of circuits have been built. These include an AM/FM stereo receiver, complete vertical and horizontal deflection systems, tape and phono amplifiers, and others, several of which are described in detail in this paper."
 "RCA has developed, sampled, anid plans to iintroduce commercially in Europe late in 1971 a large-screen, narrow-neck 110°color television system that features the RCA A67-1 SOX 25V color picture tube having a neck 29mm in diameter and the associated RCA XD4422-J 12 PST (Precision Static Toroid) deflection yoke. This novel, high-performance, economical, and basically simple system provides improved picture sharpness and is comparable to other commercial color television systems with regard to convergence, beam landing, light output, color purity, high-voltage stability, reliability, and thermal mask expansion characteristics. The required receiver deflection interface circuits for horizontal scan, vertical scan, raster shape correction, high-voltage, and convergence are straightforward extensions of commercial tube or solid-state 900 circuits. Unlike other large-screen 110°systems, no added special circuits, such as the corner convergence, dynamic blue lateral or dynamic focusing circuits are required. The RCA large-screen, narrow-neck system can be set up and serviced using the well-established industry practices for color television employed throughout the world. No different or more complex servicing procedures are required."
"The thermal stability of silicon power transsistors is affected by the following temperature-sensitive parameters: 1. ICBO 2. VEB 3. hFE 4. Switching time 5. Secondary breakdown."
  "Junction FET's with high gm, low feedback capacitance and low noise figures at 100 MHz are currently available. When operated in the common gate mode as RF amplifiers, they can provide high gain with good stability factors and almost an optimum antenna match with no input tuned circuit. In addition, tuners which require no shielding for RF stability are easily constructed. Overall receiver noise figures of less than 6 dB are readily obtainable."
"The NTSC color TV transmission system dictates that a receiver for that system must comprise the following basic elements for reproduction of the transmitted color information: * a chroma IF amplifier, to select and amplify the modulated color sub-carrier. * a sub-carrier regenerator, to furnish the required reference for demoduation of the suppressed carrier signal. * a chroma demodulator, to detect the information contained in the phase and amplitude modulation of the sub-carrier and turn it into signals suitable for driving a three-color, shadow-mask picture tube."
 "Tuning the AM-bands with tuning diodes (VVC-diodes) offers many advantages, especially in car radios. The characteristics and technology of the first member of a new generation of tuning diodes is presented. The salient features of this triple diode are its outstanding large-signal performance and the excellent tracking between the discrete diodes on the same chip. The specific characteristics of this new diode give rise to unconventional circuitry, examples of which are given."
"This paper describes new solid state video and sound i-f amplifiers for a color television receiver. The amplification stages employ all semiconductor integrated circuits. The exacting requirements of selectivity in the i-f amplifier are fulfilled by new frequency selective components, \"Piezonator\", and with the hybrid filter: the \"Piezonate-Filter\". The Piezonator is a piezoelectric resonator constructed with a thin ceramic chip hermetically sealed in a glass package. The new model of signal processing sections shows a great improvement in assembly and alignment procedure."
"The demodulation of FM stereo broadcast information may be accomplished very simply by use of no more than three transistors, four to six diodes, and two small transformers as major system components. All of these components may be very inexpensive with minimal specifications. However, accurate demodulation of FM stereo broadcast information, particularly when the signal to noise ratio of the incoming signal is poor and when the performance must be achieved over a wide ambient temperature range such as, for example, in the automobile radio, is an entirely different matter."
"This report discusses basic design theory for horizontal deflection AFC circuits. This theory was developed from the author's past study, and constitutes the third report of the engineering trilogy [1] [2] on this complex circuit. In the second report of the trilogy [2], the pull-in effect was analyzed by transforming the horizontal AFC circuit into a piece-wise-linear second-order system and making a phase plane analysis of the latter system. However, since subsequent study revealed that Richman's approach [3] in his analysis of color synchronization APC circuits is equally applicable to the analysis of horizontal AFC circuits, the author used Richman's methods to develop simple but practical design formulas for the latter circuits. In addition, it was found that the new theory could be expanded to clarify certain problems concerning pull-in time and interaction with the AGC loop, which were resistant to the former theory. Although there are still many points concerning the mutual effects of AGC and AFC loops that are yet to be clarified, a promising approach to the problem will be described herein."

"The ultimate function of a TV receiver is to translate an esoteric RF signal into a two dimensional illuminated picture and its associated audio. Although it is quite common to measure the ultimate audio, especially frequency response, in an anechoic chamber or reverberant chamber, measurement techniques for the ultimate output of video, the light from the picture tube, are not quite as common. They are, however, useful and are the ultimate in non-disruptive testing."
"This paper summarizes present knowledge of the mechanisms affecting the generation, absorption, and scattering of X-radiation from high voltage, vacuum tube regulators and rectifiers used in television receivers. In particular, calculations and experimental data showing the effects of absorption and scattering on the energy distribution of the X-rays will be discussed."
"This paper is concerned with the design of the phase locked loop (PLL) to be used as an FM demodulator. With the introduction of the PLL IC and the trend of designing inductorless circuits, there has been much interest in the PLL FM demodulator.1'2 The discussion in this paper concentrates on the steady state response of the PLL to sinusoidally frequency modulated signals;. therefore, the analytic and experimental results are shown in the form of frequency response diagrams."
 "A one-chip TV vertical deflection system is now possible through recent advances in power IC technology. This paper describes the new integrated circuit which includes the vertical oscillator, output stage, and a special flyback generator. The temperature stable sawtooth oscillator has independent hold and height controls and is capable of excellent interlace. A current drive output stage precludes the need for a linearity control or yoke thermistor while providing the versatility to directly drive black and white through large screen color yokes. The advanced output flyback system provides excellent flyback and blanking from low supply voltages."
"Various practices will be described which will contribute to reduction of arcing in the picture tube as well as better protection of receiver components. Arcing is thought to be initiated by particulate contaminants on the focus grid causing electron bombardment of the tube walls. In a typical arcing case the main source of high voltage energy into the receiver was found to be arcing from the focus grid pin across the base to the cathode pin of the blue gun and the G1 pin of the green gun (on 90°bipotential focus tubes), causing heater and cathode damage. Heater protection can be accomplished with arc gaps from the focus grid pin and cathode leads to ground."
"The decoder design is developed in block schematic form and the practical realization of the system is then described. The fundamental performance limitations are discussed and the characteristics obtained with this design summarized."
"The Hall effect as a concept is quite old. Until very recently it has been restricted to usage as a laboratory tool. Recently progress in materials research reached a point where the Hall effect could be used in limited applications such as gaussmeters. Most recently the Hall effect has been incorporated in an integrated circuit. This new type of Hall effect device has opened the possibility of broad new areas of applications. This paper discusses some of the areas where digital Hall effect IC's have been used and discusses some preliminary work and potential applications for a linear Hall effect integrated circuit."
 "The introduction of 110 degree deflection shadow mask tubes not only demands the redesign of some circuits parts in order to adapt them to circuit requirements of the new tube, but also requires the development of new circuits with functions that have been unusual so far."

 "The treatment of the deterioration of insulation as a chemical rate phenomenon has been extended to cover complex multiple reactions. The relationships between the parameters goveming the thermal stability of a polymer in a given environment are calculated first for isothermal thermal endurance test conditions and second for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) conditions. The two equations can be combined to give a rigorous mathematical solution to the problem of predicting thermal ratings of wire enamels by TGA and this is demonstrated for a Formvar ® enamel (a simple degradation reaction). For complex reactions (recognized by certain features of thermograms) life lines are shown to be curved rather than dually linear, and by examining the case of simultaneous competing reactions, the method is shown to be inapplicable to complex cases. Both the life theory and the TGA theory proposed avoid the usual assumptions concerning order of reaction, apparent activation energy, and extent of reaction. It is suggested that TGA, a very rapid technique, could also be used to investigate environmental variables in life test procedures. This approach is considered to be valid for insulations other than wire enamels, provided that electrical or mechanical failure is the result of chemical reactions."
"A comparative study has been carried out on the dielectric loss behavior of polycarbonate cable models impregnated with a standard low-viscosity mineral oil and a silicone fluid within the same viscosity range. The importance of space-charge polarization at the interfaces of the well-defined solid-liquid boundaries of such insulating systems was demonstrated; large space-charge losses were found to characterize the mineral oil-polycarbonate combination used. In contrast, a closer match between the dielectric parameters of the polycarbonate plastic and the silicone fluid resulted in a low-loss insulating system, having desirable voltage stress and temperature characteristics. Impregnant contamination was observed to lead to extremely high losses, whose magnitude exceeded appreciably that found with kraft-paper cable models under identical contamination conditions."
"A new composite polyester-glass reinforced silicone rubber/mica insulation system, designated Mycone, has been developed for high-voltage turbine generators. This system is capable of operating at Class F (155°C) temperatures, with a life expectancy comparable to that of a standard type modified asphaltmica insulation system operating at Class B (130°C) temperaturese. Use of the system will afford an increase in generator armature capability in the order of 15 percent. Although domestic industry standards do not yet include the operation of turbine-generator units above Class B (130°C) operating temperatures, many special situations exist where increased capability is of prime consideration."
"A mercury electrode tester is described, with an operating range of 10-500 V, for recording the incidence of conducting paths in capacitor tissue. Conducting inclusions detected with this instrument have been studied by scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis techniques. They have been shown to include both carbonaceous and metallic particles. It is concluded that the mercury electrode tester can detect gross conducting particles short circuiting the sheet at the lowest test voltage; thin spots and porous areas that break down at higher voltages; and smaller particles embedded in the sheet that give rise to low resistance areas by partial breakdown at higher voltages. The techniques described provide means for rapid, quantitative assessment of capacitor tissues and also for identification of the nature of the conducting particles found."
"This paper describes the results obtained from two short experimental lengths of single-phase vacuum-insulated cables, one of which can be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Using a variety of high-voltage sources, it has been shown that there is little correlation between the energy of the source and the damage produced by sparks. Hence, the chances seem good that a cryo-cable connected to a bulk power transmission system will not suffer catastrophically with each internal spark."

 "An investigation is described into partial discharge phenomena in artificial air-filled cavities of known dimensions in polyethylene. During initial tests, the 50 percent impulse-inception stress is much higher than the discharge stress calculated from Paschen's curve. It is independent of the impulse repetition rate, and is larger for 1/50-μs impulses than for 500/3000-μs surges; for both waveshapes the extinction stress is lower than the inception stress. After repeated discharges, the inception and extinction stresses are both reduced to the Paschen curve value. Initially, the 50 percent impulse-inception stress increases as the cavity diameter is decreased at constant depth and as the depth is decreased at constant diameter. After aging, the stress becomes independent of the cavity diameter. Details are given of the discharge magnitudes and time lags. It has been shown that a \"main discharge\" occurs usually on or near the crest of the surge, during which all or a substantial part of the cavity is discharged, followed by a number of smaller \"reverse discharges\" on the wavetail. When a discharge occurs on polarity reversal its magnitude tends to be appreciably greater but it can be reduced by suitable voltage conditioning. Experiments have also been made with the cavity adjacent to an electrode instead of totally enclosed in the dielectric."
"Corona discharge results, obtained with a number of gases under atmospheric pressure using plane-parallel metallic and dielectric electrodes placed between 0.05 and 9.00 mm apart, are discussed. With short gap spacings, deviations from the pulse or spark-type discharge mechanism are observed to occur in particular when dielectric surfaces are involved; the deviations are characterized usually by the appearance of pseudoglow discharges, which exhibit properties that are common to both pulse and glow discharges. The practical significance of pseudoglow discharges in relation to corona measuring techniques, utilizing conventional pulse discharge detectors, are considered both on a short-and long-term test basis."
"A selection of epoxy specimens has been subjected to a number of different tests for track resistance. The degree of agreement between testing agencies using the same method, and between the different test methods is described. Generally speaking, those methods, which impose alternate wet-dry cycles, or otherwise simulate the \"dry-banding\" effects that occur in service, appear to classify meterials in the \"correct\" order, that is, in best agreement with each other, and with actual outdoor performance. The superior track resistance of cycloaliphatic systems, and the further improvement consequent upon the use of hydrated alumina filler are confirmed. Details of the Tracking Endurance Wheel Test method are given in the Appendix."
"The erosion of synthetic insulating materials by surface discharges constitutes an important problem in the application of these materials for high-voltage outdoor applications. A method of erosion testing is described that simulates the heat flux from surface discharges by radiant energy from a thermal imaging source. This permits accurate measurement of erosion. A theory of erosion is developed that is found to agree well with experiments performed on several cycloaliphatic epoxy resin systems."
"Electrical flight systems designers have been contending with voltage breakdown in aircraft and spacecraft for more than 30 years. Breakdown occurrences have increased in magnitude and quantity as the flight hardware has become more complex. In order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to corona-voltage breakdown in flight systems, surveys were conducted to identify the major breakdown problem areas. This paper examines more than 70 voltage-breakdown cases that have occurred in scientific spacecraft systems during test in simulated environments and during flight over the period 1961-1969. Analysis of this information relates to the frequency of discharge occurrences, pressure, voltage range, nature of the discharges, direct and induced effects, problem sources, and problem reponsibility areas. Methods are proposed for eliminating or controlling unwanted electrical discharges in spacecraft systems."
"This paper is about the applications of an epoxy-impregnated paper insulation to ultra-high-voltage systems. An epoxy-impregnated paper insulation is a resin-rich void-free structure, and therefore has extremely superior voltage withstand characteristics. It also has outstanding resistances to thermal cycle and mechanical vibration. Consequently, such insulation systems can be applied easily to condenser bushings. From the standpoint of the production facilities, techniques, and economical considerations, in items with an overall length of more than 3 m, \"prefab\"-type condenser bushings, consisting of several condenser cores, are desirable. In cases when two-unit condenser cores are assembled leaving a simple conical-shaped gap between them, it is extremely effective to adopt a \"potential-expanding\"-type gap designed so that the equipotential surface in the gap will be in the vertical position to the cone surfaces as far as possible. The prefab-type condenser bushing of the 500-kV class was experimentally manufactured using this arrangement; it displayed all the desired properties. This paper also describes the other examples of applications of epoxy impregnated paper insulation: CT bushings and pulse transformers in the magnetic firing system for high-voltage dcconverters using thyristors, and draw-out-type condenser bushing for disconnecting devices used in the compact-type substation."

 "The selection of a material for use can be simplified by listing the use-requirements/material-properties systematically so that a workable combination of properties can be found. The requirements are organized under the headings of mechanical, thermal, environmental, electrical, and economic. These are generally in decreasing order of importance except where economic factors override."
"The effects of ionizing radiation on insulator parts are discussed as being the results of four associated phenomena: conduction, charge transfer, space charge buildup, and air ionization. Techniques for estimating these effects under some circumstances of interest are described."
"The methods for preventing electrical breakdown problems in space flight are discussed. The techniques that have been evolved by several successful users of high-voltage systems in space are given in considerable detail. The fundamental elements are the avoidance of high electric fields and the avoidance of critical gas pressures. Selection of materials, scrupulous cleanness, good mechanical design, solid potting or complete venting, and frequent testing are the major steps to success."
"\"Round-robin\" experiments for partial discharge degradation of polyethylene have been made by means of a parallelplate electrode system. Following this, a second round-robin was run using direct electrodes with the object of surveying some simple testing methods corresponding to actual phenomena such as local perforation by corona. Corona lifetimes of several insulating materials were measured by using two kinds of electrode systems, i.e., a hemisphere-plane configuration and a cylinder plane as recommended by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Precise differences between different materials cannot be defined because of the fluctuation of corona lifetime of the same material, but there may be some significance in the order of six kinds of materials. Several possible causes of the variability were examined with regard to the differences of test dates, humidities, airflows, and specimens' thicknesses and some information concerning relations between variability and experimental conditions was obtained. These results and considerations should be helpful relative to the adoption of the most reasonable electrode and the performance of test procedure."
"Although some reports of the water-resisting life of polyethylene-insulated wires have been made, studies of mechanism of the deterioration phenomenon have been scarcely reported. In this paper, it is pointed out that a major cause of the deterioration of polyethylene-coated wire in water is the occurrence of the \"treeing\" phenomena. An accelerated deterioration test through the use of high-frequency voltage has been developed. Using this accelerated test, experiments were conducted on the deterioration phenomenon of insulating wires under various conditions. The causes of tree generation were elucidated and a new type of insulating wires was developed. It has been discovered that when the polyethylene-insulated wire is immersed in water and voltage is applied (as occurs in a submersible pump) treeing will occur at extremely low voltages and is sensitive to the copper in the conductor. A metal barrier over the conductor greatly increases the insulation life owing to the effect of double layers."
"The power dissipated by leakage currents on the surface of wet polluted insulation leads to the loss of moisture from the pollution and the formation of dry bands. The growth of the dry band depends primarily on the surface temperature and on the temperature dependence of the surface resistance. Measurements of dry-band width for increasing applied voltage have shown that the lower the surface resistance, the lower the voltage necessary to initiate dry-band formation, and the more rapid its growth. The dry-band width is a function of the power dissipation in the band."
"Al-NaCl-Ge thin-film capacitors have been produced and subsequently analyzed in a vacuum of better than 1O-7 torr. The devices show a pronounced audio-frequency dispersion peak in tan δ, which is associated with an activation energy of 0.67 ± 0.05 eV. The NaCl films are polycrystalline with a grain size of 2 X 10-4 cm and X-ray analysis indicates a preferred orientated structure."

 "In an earlier paper two of the authors described a general-purpose digital computer program suitable for solving, with considerable precision, multidielectric fields in two dimensions or in three dimensions with at least one axis of symmetry. The program, after being rigorously checked, has been extensively used for several years to solve many practical multidielectric field problems; on all occasions it has been completely satisfactory. This paper, in addition to presenting supplementary program details, presents a few applications of the numerical method to high-voltage equipment design."

"The dielectric constant and loss of a cable insulating oil has been measured as a function of frequency and temperature. The distribution of relaxation times derived from the data is close to a log-normal (Gaussian in log τ) distribution and is found to be dependent on temperature. The activation energy for dielectric relaxation is non-Arrhenius, similar to the activation energy for viscosity. However, the temperature dependence of both activation energies is found to be significantly different."
"This is Part I of a three-part series presenting statistical methods for planning and analyzing temperature-accelerated life tests when all test units are run to failure. These methods are presented so they can be profitably used by individuals with a limited statistical background. In Part I, the Arrhenius model is described, and graphical methods for analysis of such complete data are given. In Part II, numerical methods for analysis of such data are given, and optimum and standard test plans are presented and compared. In Part III, graphical and numerical methods for comparing different products are given, and methods for assessing the validity of the data and the assumptions of the Arrhenius model are also given. These methods are illustrated throughout with accelerated life test data on insulation. While the methods are presented here with the Arrhenius model, they can be used for planning and analyzing many other accelerated life test situations."

 "Impulse generators capable of producing high voltage and narrow-width pulses are becoming increasingly useful as calibrated wide-band interference sources in the field of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). These generators produce a discrete spectrum having essentially a (sin x)/x envelope and may have a 3-dB bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz. However, spectral density calibration of these generators can become exceedingly involved and is usually subject to error. Frequently, one source of error is the inability of some calibrating instruments to respond to wide-band signals in the same manner as single-frequency signals. A new technique of impulse generator calibration is described, based solely on the amplitude measurement of the frequency components and impulse generator repetition frequency. The method is simple and straightforward and is inherently more accurate than existing techniques, such as that presented in Military Standard 462. It should be regarded as a potential replacement for the present calibration technique currently serving the EMC community."
"The general theory of annular slot antennas is developed in a lucid manner. The treatment is novel in that no Green's functions or contour integrations arise. The principle of duality is employed. Topics discussed include formulation of the integral equation for the aperture field and derivations of the leading term in the near- and far-zone fields and effective height. The theory has application in calibrating near-zone field strength instrumentation and in determining the response of an unsheathed coaxial cable connector mounted flush with the skin of a missile to intense plane-wave electromagnetic field pulses."
"The radiation field pattern of a flush-mounted coaxial aperture is derived in the frequency domain. By using the Lorentz reciprocity theorem, the equivalent current generator is obtained which drives the apparent annular antenna admittance in shunt with the load admittance. The current source, aperture admittance, and load admittance determine the transfer function. The transfer function multiplied by the expression for the spectrum of the incident pulse forms the integrand of the Fourier transform from which the time history of the current waveform in the load admittance may be obtained using a computer. There are several applications of the theory. The one of dominant interest at present may be described as follows. A coaxial transmission line terminated in a known load admittance is located in the interior of a missile. The free end of the cable forms an aperture antenna at the skin of the missile, i.e., at the normal junction of coaxial connectors. The problem is to determine the time history of the current in the load admittance when an intense transient electromagnetic field impinges on the receiving antenna. Very accurate numerical results may be obtained from this theory provided the ground plane is sufficiently large and certain dimensional limitations on the sizes of the inner conductor and sheath of the coaxial aperture (expressed in terms of the wavelength) are met."
"Correlation between atmospheric radio noise-burst amplitudes measured by the Aiya noise meter with different bandwidths was examined during periods of local thunderstorm activity. The investigations were carried over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 9 MHz and over a 6-dB bandwidth range of 300 Hz to 16 kHz. The correlation observed in all cases was so high that the standard error of estimate was nearly equal to the accuracy of measurement itself. This suggests that the phenomenon is deterministic rather than statistical. The practical utility of the result is discussed."
  "Electromagnetic fields from a current flow can be derived through physical insight that yields its equivalent in point sources that are \" ideal\"-in agreement with intuitive reasoning. Static (l/r3) fields depart from the ideal, but analysis removes them from consideration. Induction (l/r2) fields result from two equivalent sources, not one."
"Summary form only given, as follows. A correlation technique is used to detect frequency-modulation noise impulses. When implemented in an impulse-noise-cancellation system, this technique provides a 2-dB extension in the FM threshold. It also allows the impulse-detection system to be independent of the modulating signal level and frequency deviations."

"A tutorial account of the geometrical theory of diffraction is presented, and as an application of the theory the near field of a circular aperture antenna is calculated. This method is useful in calculating quite accurately the field in regions far from the antenna axis. The method finds appeal in its simple mathematical formulation which lends itself to obtaining numerical results with relative ease."
"The asymmetry in current density along the periphery of cylindrical scattering obstacles of both finite and infinite length illuminated by a plane wave electromagnetic field is discussed. In the Appendix the same problem for a spherical scatterer is considered."
"A numerical technique is presented that may be used to predict the current induced on a thin metallic body of revolution excited by an electromagnetic pulse. Examples are given. Introduced here is the use of the radiation condition in a finite difference solution. This development alleviates the requirement that finite difference techniques be applied to a bounded region of space."
"An analytic procedure is developed for the purpose of determining the effectiveness of ferromagnetic shields in shielding against magnetic fields. The basic approach is to separate the magnetization relation of a ferromagnetic material into regions in which each region is characterized by a constant permeability. Maxwell's equations are then solved in each time-varying geometric region (which correspond to the regions of the magnetization relation) and the solutions are matched at interfaces. This procedure permits solutions for nonlinear shielding problems to be readily obtained using linear techniques."
"The autocorrelation function for pseudorandom binary codes is such that these codes are ideal for suppressing unwanted reflections on antenna ranges. The method presented here depends on amplitude modulating the transmitted signal with a maximum-length linear recurring modulo-two sequence (PN code) and correlating it at the receiver with a delayed version of the code. In this way reflections whose path transit times are greater than 1 bit time from the direct path transmission time are reduced in amplitude by a factor inversely proportional to the length of the code word. Also presented is a simple means for generating the maximum-length shift-register codes using delay lines and mixers that makes this method especially practical for most antenna range applications."
"During intermodulation testing with diode mixers an increase of intermodulation interference was observed due to an increase of LO power incident to the mixer. This phenomenon conflicted with the theory that increase of LO power reduces intermodulation output of the diode mixer. In these tests the intermodulation decreased as expected when the LO power was further increased. Results of a theoretical and experimental study of how the level of incident LO power affects the intermodulation output levels emanating from the mixer are presented. The predicted results lead to the following experimentally verified conclusions. 1) A drop in power at some intermodulation frequencies occurs for an increase of LO power, depending on LO operating point and order of intermodulation. 2) Power at each intermodulation frequency will repeatedly increase, reach a maximum, and then decrease as power in LO signal increases, where the number of repetitions follows the orders of intermodulation. 3) The maximum intermodulation power at low-order intermodulation frequencies occurs for higher LO power than higher order intermodulation frequencies. LO power operating point is shown to be a significant factor in mixer intermodulation consideration. Application of these results to receiver intermodulation improvement is discussed."
"The accuracy of predicting spectra for pulsed AM systems is greatly improved by merely describing the time-domain signal with more accuracy. Specifically, a series of straight lines is used to approximate an arbitrary signal shape. Experimentally, a pulse-shaping network and spectrum analyzer were used to generate and record various time- and frequency-domain shapes. These results were compared to the theoretical plots generated by the straight line approximation technique. The improvement of this technique over the method of assigning a perfect square pulse is illustrated by plots and photographs. The theoretical results are good enough to almost eliminate the need for a frequency- spectrum signature if the signal can be observed in the time domain (by an oscilloscope)."
"Multiple and partial correlations between atmospheric noise levels at 105 kHz, 280 kHz, 1.6 MHz, and 2.9 MHz were examined. These provide a quantitative measure for the improvement in predicting the noise level at one frequency from the noise levels at a number of other frequencies rather than from that at just one frequency. The analysis also leads to the interesting result that atmospheric noise levels show properties of a Markov process in frequency domain."
"A spark may be used to ignite nonhypergolic rocket engine propellants. Broad-band radiated interference from the spark plug will be radiated through the thrust chamber throat and will limit the level to which interference can be reduced. Tests have been performed by Textron's Bell Aerospace Company to determine the extent to which the rocket engine thrust chamber attenuates radiated interference from the spark. Results indicate that, for small reaction control type engines, compliance with typical EMC specifications is a reasonable possibility."

   "This paper presents some new results on the subject of imagery analysis by transform methods. Two transform techniques are presented. The first is the Hadamard-Walsh transform and the second is an eigenvector expansion technique. Experimental results are shown in terms of the degree of imagery data compression that can be obtained for each method. Results are also presented from a simulation experiment of picture transmission in a noisy environment."
"We discuss orthogonal transformation as a method to compress frequency bandwidth for TV signals. We indicate that the slant orthogonal transformation derived from Hadamard matrix is most advantageous for compression of TV signal bandwidth. Results of simulation show that unweighted Sp-p/Nq rms of approximately 32 dB was obtained with 2.5 bits per sample on picture showing human face."
"Walsh functions are used in designinq a feature extraction algorithm. The \"axis-symmetry\" property of the Walsh functions is used to decompose geometrical patterns. An axissymmetry (a.s.)-histogram is obtained from the Walsh spectrum of a pattern by adding the squares of the spectrm coefficients that correspond to a given a.s.-number τ and plotting these against τ. Since Walsh transformation is not positionally invariant, the sequency spectrum does not specify the pattern uniquely. This disadvantage is overcome by performing a normalization on the input pattern through Fourier transformation. The a.s.-histogram is obtained from the Walsh spectrum coefficients of the Fourier-normalized rather than the original pattern. Such histogram contains implicit information about symmetries, periodicities, and discontinuities present in a figure. It is shown that a.s.-histograms result in great dimensionality reduction in the feature space, which leads to a computationally simpler classification task, and that patterns which differ only in translations or 90° rotation have equal a.s.-histograms."
"Walsh functions have become quite useful in the applications of image processing and feature selection. Due to their inherent efficiency of implementation, (they are a subset of the Reed Muller Codes and Hadamard matrices), they have become popular for coding, enhancement and other signal processing tasks. This paper will briefly describe applications in some of these areas with emphasis on a correlation analysis for justification purposes."
      "Generalized transforms for decomposing a signal in terms of discrete orthogonal transformation are developed. General relationships for factoring the transform matrices into a product of sparse matrices are derived. Efficient algorithms for fast computation of these transforms is a consequence of these sparse matrices. The flow graphs and hence the sequence of computations are identical for all the transforms with only the multipliers as the variables for the different transforms."
"Gray code is a natural way of ordering binary vectors in dyadic space, hence it appears frequently in connetion with Walsh functions. In Paley's definition of Walsh functions their sequencies are arranged in Gray code. Gray code also appears in a new Walsh function generation algorithm which obtains a function by locating all its sign changes. There are certain computational advantages in using Gray code rather than sequency ordering. Examples in fast Walsh transform, dyadic convolution and digital filtering are given. Methods of Gray code to binary conversion are discussed."
"The concept of a finite binary random sequence does not seem to be covered in the classical foundations of the theory of probability. Solomonoff, Kolmogorov and Chaitin have tried to include this case by considering the lengths of programs required to generate these sequences: a longer program implying more randomness. However this definition is difficult to apply. This paper presents a straightforward procedure using Walsh functions to determine the pattern in a binary sequence. A quantitative measure of randomness has also been proposed. This has been defined as the number of independent data (via the Walsh transform) required to generate the sequence divided by the length of the sequence. However at present this classification procedure is restricted to sequences of length 2k only. When extended to infinite sequences it yields results agreeing with those by the classical probability theory."
"The set of Walsh functions, wal(j,θ), is the character group of the dyadic group. For O≤j≤2k it is shown that they may also be derived from the character table of the abstract Abelian group Ck generated by k elements of order two. The method uses Slepians modular representation table[3] to compute the 2k irreducible representations (each of degree one) of Ck. The character table, K, is a 2kx2k square array of +1's and -l's and, considered as a matrix, the orthogonality relationships for characters show that K has the Hadamard property, [K][K]T = 2K [I]. In fact, for the proper ordering of the group elements in the construction of the modular representation table it is the Hadamard matrix, the entries of whose ith row take on the values of the Walsh function wal (i,θ) in each of θ/2k subintervals. In a similar way other permutations of the modular representation table define different functions taking on the values +l, -l, also orthogonal and in a one to one relationship to the Walsh functions. Since an n place binary group code with k information places is isomorphic to Ck,[3] each code can thus be used to generate real functions orthogonal over a given interval or period θ. In the special case of cyclic codes where the elements of the code interpreted as polynomials form an ideal in a polynomial ring of characteristic two, the group operation used in deriving the character table is of course, addition."
    "The purpose of this paper is to design and implement a resonant filter for Walsh functions driven by the proper type source to clearly indicate the resonant conditions. The basic filter consists of an inductor, two capacitors and a switch. The switch must open and close at a time necessary to cause resonance. The filter is driven by a sampled Walsh function which is converted to an impulse charge source."
"Correlation techniques provide a powerful means of extracting signals from noise and analyzing the spectrum of complex signals. The dyadic correlation function defined in Walsh-Fourier analysis is analogous to the usual correlation function in Fourier analysis. Circuits can be derived that produce this correlation function. The basic correlator circuit described here uses a dyadic shift register, which shifts a signal f(t) by modulo 2 addition into f(t ⊕ 𝒯), several multipliers and one integrator. A switching matrix composed of only singlepole single-throw switches is used to compute the desired dyadic translations of the input signal within the dyadic shift register. Furthermore, by partitioning the input signal into any desired number of binary partitions the principle of operation of a dyadic correlator can be economically implemented in digital technology using the properties of dyadic invariant systems. A binary timing circuit consisting of a cascaded array of flip-flops produces trigger pulses for the switching matrix to sequentially produce each dyadic translation. Hence, correlation based on Walsh-Fourier analysis can be implemented economically by digital circuits for signals that are partitioned into as many binary intervals as desired."
     "Discrete Walsh-Fourier transform (WET) have found increasing use in the area of digital signal processing and transmissicon. Assuming that the signal is amplitude-bounded, bounds on the WFT domain sample amplitudes are obtained. From an appropriately chosen group of sample amplitudes in the WET domain, corresponding set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsums in the signal damain can be obtained. From the knowledge of these subsums, amplitude bounds on the remaining WET domain samples can be obtained. The group of sample amplitudes in the WFT domain may be recursively chosen. This results into the partitioning of WET domain in various sets such that all the samples of a particular set have the same amplitude bounds. Two such recursive procedures are worked out. Set-dependent quantization transfer characteristics, restricteci within the dynamic amplitude range appropriate to individual sets, are proposed. Effect of both the set-dependent WFT damain quantization schemes on the reconstructed signal is analyzed. Efficient computational algorithms are developed. Appropriate signal characteristics for both the schemes are pointed out."
       "Walsh functions are potentially applicable to random-access communication provided that requirements for system synchronization and channel linearity are not too severe. This paper investigates the problem of detection of a desired Walsh-code modulated sinusoidal carrier in the presence of other signals for the case when synchronization is not achieved among the users of the system. It is shown that by proper selection of Walsh codes, the synchronization requirements can be alleviated considerably and it may be possible to operate the system asynchronously. The effect of hardlimiting and the problem of transmitting a number of Walsh signals through a power-law device are also considered."
 "The discrete two-dimensional Walsh transform is presented as a specific example of a generalized harmonic analysis approach to (visual) image classification. Certain known aspects of biological systems are briefly presented as motivation for this approach, and some computer experiments are referenced and offered as validation of the approach. It is suggested that the mathematics typified by the Walsh transform provides an appropriate description of neural interactions in the primate visual system."
"It is well known that the usual frequency filters based on sine-cosine functions do not require synchronization. Furthermore, sinusoidal electromagnetic waves of different frequency can be separated in mobile communication without any synchronization between the various transmitters and receivers, It is widely believed that this is a result of certain shift invariant features of sinusoidal functions that do not exist for other functions, The purpose of this paper is to show by means of simple examples that there are infinitely many systems of functions on which one may base asynchronous filters and mobile radio commnuication. The difference in the usefulness of these systems of functions depends only on the state of technology, no system is inherently better than others."

 "A statistical model for establishing the probability of being able to successfully communicate is developed. The model is based on requirements for meeting both a specific signal-to-interference criterion and a specific signal-to-noise criterion, and takes into account the correlation that exists in the variations of desired and undesired path loss."
"Measurements of local fields produced by simulated sources of conducted noise show good correlation with data from three theoretical models: a) an electric dipole, b) a magnetic dipole, and c) a parallel wire transmission line, depending upon the configuration of the source and its \"ground.\" The significance of the \"common-mode\" current below about 2 MHz is demonstrated."
"A model is presented for determining the transient currents and voltages induced within a long coaxial cable by a uniform plane traveling wave whose variation with time may be specified. The cable may be located above or within a half-space lossy dielectric with the wave incident from the half-space lossless dielectric. This results in a model for either aerial or buried cables with the source of the wave located in the atmosphere. A method is also presented for generalizing the approach to more complex cables encountered in communication systems. A demonstration of the applicability of this model is presented by analyzing the response of a 0.375-in coaxial cable for both aerial and buried situations. An incident electromagnetic wave with a rectangular time domain waveform is used to demonstrate the transient response. This waveshape is adequate to clearly indicate the transient phenomena. It is found that voltage enhancement results in both aerial and buried cables when the incident wave approaches grazing incidence. This voltage enhancement can be significant especially for aerial cables. Cable shield current enhancement also results for an aerial but not for a buried cable."
"The theory and instrumentation designed to measure the loop impedence of a power line are discussed. The theory of the system is derived first, followed by a discussion of the instrumentation, and finally an evaluation of the system accuracy is given."
"Short-term time characteristics of burst and quasi- continuous forms of atmospheric radio noise were investigated at Bangalore at a number of frequencies in the range 100 kHz-9 MHz and over a 300-Hz-16-kHz range of bandwidth. It was found that for all frequencies, bandwidths, and threshold levels the duration and spacing follow log-normal distributions. The duration of a pulse above a particular threshold is statistically independent of its spacing from an adjacent pulse. Further, the average duration varies approximately linearly with the threshold level. These results are expected to be of use in planning digital communications where atmospheric noise is the limiting factor in reception capability."

 "A review of some of the underlying reasons for crime is presented, together with a perspective-setting view of the present status of crime in the United States. A statistical analysis of the number of repeaters is presented as the basis for a crime control system consisting of a transponder carried by each convicted person after he is released from confinement. Real-time tracking of these transponders is done by a computer-radio system; when a crime is committed a quick check shows at least who was not involved. Countermeasures and some social implications are also covered."
"The radio frequency spectrum is becoming increasingly saturated and polluted due to intensified use and unnecessary radiations and is being taxed severely to meet man's communications-electronics needs. Additional corrective measures are necessary-improved standards, increased concern for conservation of the resource, greater emphasis on intersystems compatibility, increased research, better educational and training programs, and the inclusion of economic and social values in evaluating the uses to which the spectrum should be put."
"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the signal from an IR detector in a system employing a moving space filter. The space filter may be a reticle or simply a \"flying spot\" aperture. When the IR detector output is caused by background radiation, the Wiener spectrum description is presumed adequate. The linear scanning case is considered in greater detail. A calculation of the detector output spectrum is made, assuming a generally accepted Wiener spectrum and a scanning rectangular aperture."
"In this paper expressions are derived for the error in position measurement for the problem of estimating the position of an infrared target in a random background and the combined prob lem when white detector noise is also affecting the estimation. Space filters performing linear scanning, nutation, and rotation are considered. A linear scanning infrared system is then considered in greater detail. The noise on the error signal is calculated, taking into account both the estimation error, as discussed in the first part, and \"false alarms\" occurring in the scan area far from the target."
"Advancements in technology have led to increased demand for avionics in airborne applications. Although aeronautical system suppliers have implemented improved procedures and design approaches which are generally effective, challenges continue to exist. This paper explores several areas where overall aeronautical system design might be improved by proper emphasis on avionic subsystem design. The topics selected include standardization, weight impact, environmental control, maintainability, and avionic equipment growth. Comparisons are made in terms of ultimate cost to the aeronautical system user."
"A space diversity method of receiving and processing ILS localizer information has been developed and flight tested. Multiple lateral ly separated antennas are used which sense the ILS signal on and around the approach path. Combining these signals suppresses ILS beam distortion produced by multipath signal interference and provides much improved guidance information to the landing aircraft control system."
"The scattering effect of structures on Instrument Landing System localizer signals is analyzed in this paper. A generalized computer program results which can be used to determine the reflection from surfaces of most materials and orientations for which the radius of curvature is large compared with the wavelength. For most reflecting walls, a closed form solution is used and the computation time is short. The program will enable users to determine the placement of hangars, towers, etc., in airports and to find ways to reduce their effect on localizer facilities."
"A differential equation is developed for the orientation vector relating the body frame to a chosen reference frame. The time derivative of this vector is the sum of the inertially measurable angular velocity vector and of the inertially nonmeasurable noncommutativity rate vector. It is precisely this noncommutativity rate vector that causes the computational problems when numerically integrating the direction cosine matrix. The orientation vector formulation allows the noncommutativity contribution to be isolated and, therefore, treated separately and advantageously. An orientation vector mechanization is presented for a strap down inertial system. Further, an example is given of the applica tion of this formulation to a typical rigid body rotation problem."
"This paper discusses reliability aspects of a modular multiprocessor currently under development by the Naval Air Systems Command. The operating system, or executive, of this computer may be implemented in various ways. These include a totally software \"floating executive,\" one dedicated to a specific processor, or an executive consisting of special-purpose hardware. The objections to hardware executives, especially for avionic applications, include a supposed degradation in system reliability. This paper shows that under certain conditions this degradation need not occur."
"Linear systems with quadratic performance criteria typically lead to two-point boundary value problems. The numerical solution of such problems is often difficult because of roundoff and truncation errors. In this paper numerical methods for digital computer solutions are considered for a system described by a given second-order linear differential equation and the results are compared. The results show that where accurate analytic solutions cannot be obtained, the invariant imbedding technique yields more accurate results, for a given integration grid interval, than the other methods considered."
"The extended Kalman-Bucy filtering algorithm is applied to the problem of estimating the system parameters of a single-channel missile attitude control system. In particular, noisy observations of body angular rate, normal acceleration, and control surface deflec tion are used in the algorithm to obtain estimates of body angular rate, angle of attack, control surface deflection, air density, and missile velocity. Computational results obtained for this problem are presented. These results are evaluated to determine the applicapility of this estimator as a part of an adaptive control scheme. In addition, a general approach to the formulation of practical nonlinear estimation problems is suggested."
"This paper introduces a statistical filter (or, more strictly, a filtering algorithm) which has intended application in the area of nonlinear systems. Within this context, the filter enables one to investigate the convergence effects produced by varying the initial estimates associated with the respective state variables, together with the various system parameters. The present algorithm is not intended to replace the more powerful optimal statistical filters used in linear theory, but rather to provide a simulation tool which can readily be applied to a given nonlinear system. The application considered in this paper bears a similarity to a tracking problem which might be encountered by an optical device, where angular information is the primary observable quanity. In this particular application, angular observations are available, and statistical estimates are desired for a position variable, together with an unknown parameter. The application is introduced primarily for the purpose of demonstrating the behavior of the filter when applied to a relatively simple nonlinear system."
"Five important tracking filters that are often candidates for implementation in systems that must track maneuvering vehicles are compared in terms of tracking accuracy and computer requirements for tactical applications. A rationale for selecting among these filters, which include a Kalman filter, a simplified Kalman filter, an α-ß filter, a Wiener filter, and a two-point extrapolator, is illustrated by two examples taken from the authors' recent experience."

"The investment costs of long-haul, modern, radio relay and coaxialcable systems, as determined from data submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, are presented. Formulas to determine costs per voice-circuit-mile, and per television-channel-mile, are developed. The specific facilities investigated are the TD-2, TD-3, and TH radio relay systems, and the L-3 12-tube and L-4 20-tube coaxial cable systems. The radio relay systems are significantly, with one exception, less expensive than coaxial cable systems over their design capacity ranges. The L-4 20-tube coaxial cable system (32 400 voice circuits) and the TD-3 radio relaysystem (12 000 voice circuits) have approximately equal investment costs per voice-circuit-mile ($3.40) at full capacity."
"This paper presents a discussion of multipath disturbance of a satellite interferometer. A mathematical expression is developed, in which an upper bound of the error of the measured angle difference and position locations owing to multipath is expressed in terms of geometrical system parameters and the amplitude and phase of the multipath signal. Because diffuse reflection from a rough surface is predominant, the spectrum of multipath reflections is calculated. Multipath rejection by filtering is discussed, and curves for the position errors are presented."
"A system for measuring the attitude of a small scientific satellite is described. It consists of a magnetic aspect system and a solar aspect system, and has been flown successfully on two missions. The development was aimed at achieving maximum precision while observing the severe restrictions natural in a small satellite. The result is a set of instruments differing in several respects from previously existing hardware. The flight results have proved very interesting and are expected to yield useful technological experience."
"A problem f requently encountered by radar systems analysts is the evaluation of the \"double-threshold\" or M out of N detection process. Detection probabilities of this process are binomially distributed, making it difficult to obtain exact results for large values of the number of samples and for low probabilities of false alarm. In this paper, the M out of N detection algorithm is defined and detection performance is calculated for the special cases of the nonfluctuating target and Swerling cases I and 11 for false alarm probabilities of 106, 10-8 and 10-10."
"In an earlier paper, Maisel [6] considered two-channel detection systems using a sidelobe blanking logic when a nonfluctuating target was present. This paper is an extension of the earlier work to include fluctuating targets. The Swerling I, II, III, and IV models are considered when single-pulse detection is of interest. An adaptive threshold procedure is also briefly discussed whereby the probability of false alarm at any given resolution cell is maintained constant, even though the input clutter level may vary from cell to cell or from beam position to beam position. Useful data are presented for detection probabilities in the range 0.5 to 0.9, for false alarm probabilities in the range 104 to 10-8, and for a false detection probability of 0.1 for a sidelobe target yielding an apparent signal to total noise power density ratio of 13.0 dB in the main beam receiver."
"The off-axis angle indicated by a conventional monopulse radar is only the real part of a \"complex indicated angle.\" The presence of unresolved targets or multipath distorts the real part (causing an erroneous angle indication) and also produces an imaginary part, which can easily be measured by processing the normally unused quadrature-phase component of the difference signal. Under certain conditions the angles, amplitude ratio, and relative phase of two unresolved targets can theoretically be determined by meas urements of the complex indicated angle on two pulses separated by a short interval. In the special case of multipath, known relationships between the unresolved target and image theoretically permit determination of target elevation with a single pulse."
"The complex angle (CA) method for resolving a low angle target from its multipath signal is evaluated in the presence of system noise. It is shown that standard deviation improvements of around 3-to-1 can be achieved at a 20-dB signal-to-noise power ratio relative to a normal monopulse system without the CA. It is also shown that the CA method is unbiased, giving bias improvements of as much as 100 times relative to normal monopulse. Evaluation of the assumptions in the technique shows very little sensitivity to knowledge of the reflecting surface's conductivity or dielectric constant. However, the method is somewhat sensitive to knowledge of surface roughness."
"A method is described whereby a conventional non-Doppler radar may be used in the measurement and detection of atmospheric turbulence. The technique involves the measurement of the average echo power and the variance of the fluctuation spectrum in each of two separated pulse volumes, and corresponding measure ments of echo power and variance of the detected signals in a channel representing the predetection sum of the signals from those two volumes. It is shown that the variance of the sum channel is the power-weighted sum of the variances in the independent channels plus a term dependent upon the difference in mean radial velocity of the associated pulse volumes. Accordingly, the difference in mean radial velocity can be measured. When the spacing of the sampled volumes is adjusted to represent distance along an aircraft flight plan, the measurement is a measure of the turbulence to be experienced in traversing the space between those volumes. Specific systems for accomplishing the measure ment are discussed."
"This paper presents the concept, theory of operation, characteris tic equations, and error analysis of four wide-band monopulse techniques. The basic techniques described, which include pure amplitude monopulse, phase and amplitude monopulse (two-and three-channel configurations), and pure phase monopulse interferometer, are particularly applicable to monopulse direction finding systems that require frequency coverage over several octaves and open-loop angle bearing of several degrees. Sufficient detail and working formulas are included to permit a trade-off analysis to be made between the direction-finding techniques for selection in specific hardware applications."
"The problem of detecting a train of Doppler shifted pulses in a clutter-plus-noise environment is considered. The particular problem of the conventional video MTI radar with unambiguous range is discussed and the optimum Doppler filter obtainable by symmtrically tapering, or weighting, the received pulses is derived. The dual optimization criteria of maximum clutter-plus-noise rejection and minimum filter ripple in the passband are employed. Both equally and unequally spaced pulse trains are also considered."
"The probability is calculated of detecting coherent light in the presence of background light that has passed through a narrow-band filter of either rectangular or Lorentz frequency characteristic. Both signal and background fall on a photoelectric surface whose emitted electrons are counted and subjected to a randomized decision procedure that yields a preassigned false-alarm probability."
"The two-dimensional spectrum is used to compute the optimum low-pass filter bandwidth for the detection of a pulse in noise having an exponential variation of the spectrum level. A simple equation for the two dimensional spectrum of the input is derived. The resulting equations are used to compute curves showing the time variation of the optimum filter bandwidth and the variation of the output signal-to-noise ratio."
"A current-summing digital-to-analog converter can be constructed by combining a switched, binary-weighted resistor network with an operational amplifier. Contributions to total system errors from reference inaccuracies, resistor ratio tolerances, and operational amplifier errors can be held to less than one part in 105 and are normally far outweighed by error contributions from the switches employed. This correspondence describes a technique which reduces the switch error contributions to an insignificant level."
"The output mean and variance are determined for an analog cross correlator whose input signals have a delay which varies linearly with time. The output variance is seen to depend on the fourth-order expectation of the input signals. Examples are included to show how the varying delay could change the location of the correlation peak and, in some cases, give rise to multiple peaks. The output signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the output mean to the output standard deviation, evaluated at the correlation peak. For the case of low-pass, white, Gaussian input signals, and a correla tor using an ideal integrator as averager, the output signal-to-noise ratio is plotted versus integration time for various combinations of delay rate and input signal-to-noise ratio. For a constant delay, the output signal to-noise ratio increases monotonically with integration time; but for nonzero delay rates, optimum integration times exist. Also, for fixed input signal-to-noise ratio, the output signal-to-noise ratio, at the optimum integration time, decreases with increasing delay rate."
 "This correspondence carries out an analysis of the noise power generated by a saturating A/D converter when the input signal has an assumed Gaussian probability density function. Two noise powers are found to contribute to the output device noise, i e., one due to quantization effects and one due to saturation effects. The results of this analysis should have application to a broad class of radar and sonar problems."

 "Extraterrestrial radio sources, whose emission characteristics (flux density, spectrum, angular size) and coordinates have been firmly established by careful observations, have application in the measurement of the effective area (aperture efficiency and gain) of an antenna and its radiation pattern. The radio-emission characteristics of the strong discrete (celestial) radio sources, of the sun, and of the moon are presented. Problems encountered when the sensitivity is insufficient for complete radiation pattern determination , when the width of the radio source is comparable to the beamwidth of the antenna, when the illumination of the antenna aperture varies with pointing direction, or when the techniques are extended (after determining the gain of the ground-based antenna) to the measurement of the effective radiated power from a satellite are discussed."
"This paper develops the expressions for computing the footprint on Earth (i.e., power density contours) of a satellite antenna. The expression for determining the antenna pattern coordinate as a function of the Earth coordinates is derived. The antenna pattern operator which converts the pattern function into the available power density is obtained. In this case it is assumed that the Earth-based antenna is directed towards the satellite. The radar operator is also derived; this operator yields the power density intercepted by the Earth."
"It is shown that the errors associated with radio elevation measurements may be investigated systematically using a variational technique. The error occurring when spaced antennas are used is compared with that for a single directional antenna. Integral expressions are obtained for the refractive errors."
"This paper presents exact formulas and graphs to determine the root-mean-square error of prediction for position and velocity estimates of an object, based on least-squares smoothing. The prediction interval is taken from an endpoint estimate up to ten times the smoothing interval. The rms values may be used to determine how large a search volume must be to accommodate a substantial data dropout interval."
"Adaptive array receiving antennas can be designed to sense the external noise field and to optimize the array illumination function. A substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained with adaptive arrays when the external noise field is nonuniformly distributed in angle. The external noise process may be time varying and contain both discrete sources and continuously distributed sources. Two adaptive array implementations which maximize the signal-to-noise ratio are described in this paper. Expressions are derived for control-loop noise, i.e., the variance of the array element weights, and for the additional noise in the array output due to this element weight noise. It is shown that both the element weight noise and the array convergence rate are determined by the eigenvalues of the noise covariance matrix."
"This paper deals with the design parameters of a communications satellite which would be capable of providing domestic telephony, data, and television distribution services. Certain important aspects of the design are discussed, including satellite antenna beam coverage, transponder bandwidth, and transponder radiated power for a given weight range. A baseline satellite design is then presented which has 24 transponders (with 4000 watts radiated power on-axis and 34-MHz radio-frequency bandwidth) fully accessible from the 48 contiguous United States. The design uses crossed linear polarization to reuse the satellite transmit and receive frequency spectrum."
"Stretch is a passive, linear, time-variant technique for performing temporal operations on many classes of signals. The technique employs three dispersive networks and a mixer. Signal slowdown, speedup, or time reversal can be attained by choice of network slopes. These temporal operations are performed within a signal \"window,\" and the duration of the window is determined by the network time-bandwidth products. Both heuristic argumentation and rigorous analysis are presented, as are the results of a simple laboratory experiment."
"When a pseudo-random frequency-hopping signal is intercepted by a conventional receiver operating within the same frequency band, the interfering signal has the form of a pulse-amplitude modulated signal. Each pulse amplitude is dependent upon the hopping frequency and the selectivity characteristic of the victim receiver. The probability density function for the interfering pulse amplitude prior to demodulation is determined when the probability density function for the hopping frequency is uniform and the victim-receiver characteristic is 1) ideal flat bandpass, 2) single tuned, and 3) Gaussian shaped. It is shown that the average interfering pulse amplitude and interference power decrease as the frequency-hopping bandwidth increases with respect to the victim-receiver bandwidth. Fast Fourier transform computer techniques are used to obtain the probability density function of the interference amplitude in a Gaussian receiver when several (from 2 to 10) pseudo-random frequency-hopping systems are simultaneously using the same frequency band. The probability that the interference exceeds a prescribed threshold value is computed from the derived probability density functions. This probability may be used in signal-to-interference ratio calculations, to describe the capture effect, or to compute the expected number of clicks produced in an FM discriminator."
"A new method of measuring the attitude of spacecraft with respect to a reference beam of laser light or star light is described. The method uses the spatial coherence property of these beams and provides accuracies of ± 0.01 second of arc or greater. After giving a general description of the method, the feasibility of constructing such systems using presently available lasers and detectors is established. Finally, some aspects of the detection equipment are examined in detail."
"The difficult problem of synthesizing an optimal regulation scheme for linear time-invariant systems, assuming an integral quadratic cost functional, when the desired output is a constant nonzero vector and when the upper time limit approaches infinity, is studied in this paper. The problem is solved by properly redefining the cost functional, so that consistence with the stability requirement is achieved. The problem of the optimal closed-loop regulation of a singleinput/single-output system has always been an interesting topic for control engineers. The most common assumption is that the cost functional to minimize be of quadratic type, with infinity as an upper limit. The classical frequency domain approach, assuming the absence of initial conditions, suggests an optimal compensator in forward loop. On the other hand, the modern time-domain approach, based on the direct application of the maximum principle, yields a closed-form solution for the case in which the desired output is zero. This paper presents results which allow one to consider from a unifying point of view the two above approaches and, in addition, suggests a stable optimal scheme which is valid for any initial state and for any desired constant output."
"The rotation of a spin-stabilized satellite employing a turnstile antenna for reception and retransmission affects two-way Doppler range-rate measurements. Two different types of tracking systems are considered and, in both systems, the range-rate measurement is changed by the amount \\begin{equation*} |\\Delta \\dot{r}| = \\frac{|1 \\pm 1/k|}{2} \\lambda_{t}f_{s} \\end{equation*} where k is the turn-around ratio of the satellite transponder, Xt is the wavelength of the ground-based transmitter, and fs is the spin rate of the satellite. The positive sign is used if the turnstile antenna elements are connected to give the same polarization for both reception and transmission. If the antenna connections result in different polarizations, the minus sign is used and the magnitude of the effect is reduced."
"When a phase-modulated carrier of the form sin (wt+ϕ) is multiplied by cos (wt), the recovered phase modulation is sin (ϕ), which is a distorted version of . For small ϕ, the error is small, but is appreciable as A approaches unity or more. When ϕ is complicated (several subcarriers for example), the intermodulation can seriously degrade the system. This paper discusses distortion reduction by means of predistortion and postdistortion."
"This paper summarizes a drive system design for controlling the position and rate of solar power arrays on orbiting spacecraft. There are no gears or sliding contact elements used anywhere in the system and only low-speed bearings are needed. Such mechanization is particularly well suited to solid lubrication techniques, and wear rates are very low, so that the drive system can operate directly in the space environment for long periods of time. Three major components were developed for implementation of this design concept. They are: 1) a brushless dc torque motor; 2) a rotary power transformer; and 3) an offset-tooth shaft position and rate sensor. These components are combined in a hybrid system configuration in which the signal processing and logic functions are performed by digital and linear integrated circuits. A root contour and describing function analysis, confirmed by experimentation, shows that several modes of limit cycle generation can occur in the vicinity of null. Compensation circuits are given that inhibit or suppress limit cycling and provide controlled electronic damping of the system. The system offers relatively high stiffness and can be operated at indefinitely low angular rates with minimum power consumption."
"A design goal for miniaturization has long been the elimination of the magnetic circuit. In practice, the size/weight penalties are decreased by operation at higher frequency where core size can be effectively reduced. When microcircuitry is considered, the magnetic circuit is designed out. Either RC or active networks replace inductance, or it is externally added to the microcircuit. This paper will demonstrate that the microcircuit elements can be readily interconnected inside of ferrite pot cores. Linear circuits using the magnetic circuit to advantage can be packaged in the same volume as the transformer, inductance, or filter alone. The natural RFI and radiation shielding, as well as heat transfer capabilities, are inherent with this form of packaging. For illustration, a 2-kV, 20-μA power supply featuring a 60-kHz, class C oscillator; a 10-volt, 100-mA converter featuring a 300-kHz square-wave oscillator; and a 9.5-volt, 100-mA switching regulator are packaged inside ferrite pot cores. With this technique only functional input-output connections are necessary, since the microcircuitry interconnections are inside the pot core."
"Electrical characteristics of n-p silicon solar cells have been obtained experimentally over the temperature range of +28 to -175° and for illumination intensities from 140 to 1.5 mW/cm2. Critical parameters and their distribution are presented for several hundred solar cells from various manufacturers. The effect of cell selection either to a minimum power output at 28° at 5 mW/cm2 or to a minimum open-circuit voltage at -128° at 5.16 mW/cm2 upon the magnitude and distribution of the critical parameters is investigated. Considerable differences are noted, not just between cells, but also between lots from various manufacturers. Correlation analysis reveals no parameter which when measured at room temperature will predict the power output at low temperatures. This is due to a number of anomalies of the output characteristics at low temperature. These are a lack of the open voltage to continue to increase with decreasing temperature and a double break in the current-voltage characteristics. In addition, some cells show low shunt resistance which makes them have a poor performance at low intensities."
"This paper concerns the effects of modeling and bias errors in discrete-time state estimation. The newly derived algorithms include the effect of correlation between plant and measurement noise in the system. The effects of nonzero mean noise terms and bias errors are considered. With plant or measurement matrix errors, divergence can occur. The local or linear sensitivity approach to error analysis, where the sensitivity is defined as a partial derivative with respect to a variable parameter taken about the modeled value, will not show this divergence due to neglect of higher order terms. Approximate algorithms are presented which circumvent the problem inherent in the local sensitivity approach. These make use of a \"conditional bias\" concept which views system error as a bias, conditioned on knowledge of the state estimates. It is shown that the actual error in optimum estimation is orthogonal to the residue error for suboptimum estimation where the residue error is defined as the difference between the actual estimation error and the optimum estimation error. Two examples, one concerning an integrated navigation system, demonstrate the theoretical results."
"This paper discusses an approach to linear estimation through use of a \"control\" fed back into the system to cancel out the effect of disturbances or error signals. Although this approach has very restricted application, it has found important usage in integrated navigation systems where one subsystem is an inertial measurement system. This approach is shown to be suboptimal and is compared with the optimal with respect to estimation accuracy and sensitivity to modeling errors. The feedback approach to estimation is shown to be similar to error estimation and correction in which the error states of the system are estimated and external correction applied. For discrete estimation using the feedback approach it is shown that error variance and Kalman gains for one-stage prediction should be used. Two examples are considered which compare the feedback approach to the optimum estimation approach. The system of the first example is quite simple, but provides simple analytical comparisons of the two estimation approaches. The second example system consists of a single-axis inertial guidance system and an independent position measuring system. Accuracy and sensitivity to modeling errors are compared. Other advantages and disadvantages of the two estimation approaches are discussed."
"The performance of the modulation cancellation altimeter is investigated. Several sources of error are considered, specifically: 1) terrain averaging error; 2) output noise fluctuations; 3) errors due to phase shifts; and 4) acquisition ambiguities. The predominant parameters affecting these errors are investigated with a view towards optimizing the performance of the altimeter."
"A methodology for determining priorities in allocating test resources among the various subsystems within a large system is described. The methodology is based on concepts from applied decision theory. Two versions of the methodology are presented: a complete version, called the extensive form, and an approximate version, called the diminutive form."
"A system for distributing a frequency reference, which involves the use of geostationary satellites and two-way microwave transmissions, seems capable of stabilities exceeding those of primary atomic standards. The principal sources of error are instabilities in oscillators in the system, imperfect geostationary orbits, additive noise, and radio propagation effects. Even extreme assumptions of propagation phase instability lead to very small errors. Thus the limitations on stability seem to be imposed by the hardware."
"Despite recent advances in computational and experimental technology, many approximate methods are of considerable practical value in the field of radar cross-section (RCS) analysis. This is true particularly where time and/or funding is limited. Here we shall examine RCS data both in the high-frequency and in the lowfrequency ranges to illustrate some of the advantages which accrue from the application of more economical approximate techniques."
 "A comparison is made between the moving window and feedback integrator detectors for a scanning radar. Detection probabilities and position estimates are calculated by using a Monte Carlo simulation. The moving window is a slightly better detector than the feedback integrator: it provides 0.5-dB better detection capability and 8 percent more accurate estimate of position. However, the feedback integrator can be implemented more easily."
"The detectability of signals with burst-like qualities is investigated. Detectability is interpreted in terms of the performance of the optimum (likelihood ratio) detector for this type of signal. At low false alarm probabilities, long signal bursts interspersed by long periods of signal absence are found to be more detectable than short, rapid bursts. Essentially opposite results are true for shorter bursts."
"The normalization technique usually employed in \"analytic platforms\" in which quaternions are used to update the orientation of the vehicle is the one which divides the components of the quaternion by its magnitude. In this correspondence, it is analytically shown that this is the \"best\" normalization technique. A geometrical interpretation of this result is also given."

 "The Scientific Revolution of the twentieth century has been exploited and subverted in our country by the \"political-scientific\" complex. This complex has discarded our traditional system under which the planning and organizing of productive scientific ventures has been in the hands of responsible professional engineers whose first duty is to serve the best interests of the public. Instead, this complex originates and administers highly sophisticated sciencebased programs, whose open-ended deficit financing is rapidly undermining our American economic system. By this means America is gradually being committed to a system of centralized authority and to the eventual disappearance of human liberty and justice under law. This marks an historic turning point for the world and for all mankind. The scientific term for this process is \"technocratic petrification of freedom\" which ends in \"scientific despotism.\""
 "This paper extends recent work of Nishimura to consider velocity-aided Kalman filtering for one-dimensional motion under random acceleration. It is shown through examination of the steady-state solution and the transient time constants that estimates incorporating velocity observations can be significantly improved over estimates based on range data alone."
"An \"anti-system\" and a \"system\" approach : to building a new subway system in Detroit is presented, together with the alternatives imposed by the actual conditions as opposed to the ideal solution."
"One morning I awoke with the disquieting feeling that I had been here before; confronted with a war, a sagging economy, the prospect of a cut in research funds, and a generation gap. A look at past Anglo-American wars and recessions over a 300-year period shows that they occur every 25 years on the average, i. e., about every generation. There are signs that the rising generation will bail us out."
"A dynamic approach to the construction of an urban growth model for alternative evaluations is presented. Both urban growth theory and an attempt to couple computers and display technology into a new system are covered."
"Radio frequency spectrum management for the 1970's is discussed, with the role of IEEE's Joint Technical Advisory Committee defined."
"This paper considers optimum (MMSE) linear recursive estimation of stochastic signals in the presence of multiplicative noise in addition to measurement noise. Often problems associated with phenomena such as fading or reflection of the transmitted signal at an ionospheric layer, and also situations involving sampling, gating, or amplitude modulation, can be cast into such formulation. The different kinds of estimation problems treated include one-stage prediction, filtering, and smoothing. Algorithms are presented for discrete time as well as for continuous time estimation."
"The objectives of this paper are threefold. The first is to obtain a sampled data model of a gated phase-locked loop. Data from measurements made on an actual loop constructed in the laboratory are included, and the good agreement between measured and calculated results serves as a verification of the model. Second, with the aid of the model, some of the basic operating properties of the system will be presented. Third, comparisons will be made between gated and continuous loop operation."
"A sampled-data delay-lock loop (SDDLL) which tracks the arrival time of a biphase modulated, pulsed-envelope RF signal is described. A pseudo-noise (PN) code generator is used as the modulation source as in conventional delay-lock loop tracking devices. Time base shifting of the loop's local clock is performed by digital means. The technique permits the use of a stable-frequency clock to maintain accurate timing between timing correction instants. An expression is derived for the standard deviation of the timing error due to additive Gaussian noise at the SDDLL input. Experimental results are then given which include the effects of control-system quantization error on timing jitter. Assuming that the errors due to input noise and quantized timing corrections are independent and additive, the theoretical and experimental results agree to within approximately one decibel."
"Pulse-burst radar attempts to capitalize on the advantages of both low and high PRF radar while minimizing their disadvantages. Optimization procedures are applied to the choice of transmitter signal and receiver weighting. The results are compared to the use of Tschebyscheff transmitter weighting with an optimized receiver. The effects of various design and operational parameters are indicated. The performance of pulse-burst radar is qualitatively compared to that of conventional low and high PRF Doppler radar. It is concluded that pulse-burst radar offers the possibility of achieving a solution to the MTI problem under operational conditions where conventional Doppler radars fail."
"This paper considers the effects of slowly moving targets as they appear in the output of an airborne coherent side-looking synthetic aperture imaging radar. The image of a moving reflector is described, and two approaches to airborne moving target indication (AMTI) are summarized. It is shown that the effects of target movement are decreased as the radar scan rate is increased, and are increased as the (Doppler processed) compression ratio is increased."
"Optimal open-loop and suboptimal closed-loop controls for a VTOL aircraft in a minimum climb-to-cruise time transition are presented in this paper. The optimal open-loop controls are synthesized by a proposed gradient technique which provides for the selection of desired changes in physically meaningful parameters during each iteration step. The suboptimal closed-loop controls are synthesized as integral mean-square approximations to the optimal open-loop controls over the minimum time-to- climb interval. Piecewiseconstant feedback gains and switching times are synthesized for multidimensional control vectors which are linear combinations of observable states. Several computational results are presented for optimal and suboptimal minimum time controls with constrained and unconstrained terminal flight-path angles."
"The problem treated here is the analysis of a class of nonlinear sampled-data systems with a Gaussian input signal. The nonlinear element is a symmetrical limiter (memoryless device) that feeds the linear element. Preceding the limiter is a sampler and zero-order hold unit for data reconstruction. The analysis is predicated on finding an equivalent gain for the nonlinear element such that the mean-square error is a minimum. The nonlinearity is thus replaced by a linear component and the system is then analyzed by conventional techniques. It is also shown that for appropriate sampling rates the sampled-data system is equivalent to a continuous system due to the action of the sampler-hold combination. All calculations pertaining to the limiter input signal require the use of a transfer function that is interior to the feedback loop. However, in developing this transfer function, the overall system is considered so that the system output may be evaluated after the value of equivalent gain has been found."
"The design concept for thick film microcircuit dc-to-dc converter electronics used in the power subsystem of the Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft is presented. Microcircuits have been used in low power logic circuits for nearly ten years, but only recently have these techniques been applied to power subsystem circuits which operate at higher power levels. Thick film microcircuit techniques have been utilized in a dc-to-dc converter reducing weight by 70 percent, volume by 80 percent, and interconnections by 75 percent. The close piece-part spacing allowed short interconnections and lower dissipation, and reduced noise coupling. The developed microcircuit handled total power levels from one watt to twenty-five watts."
"This paper describes an algorithm which protects a three-gimballed inertial system against gimbal lock while preserving the inertial reference. One sample of the gimbal angles and gimbal angle rates for a torque-free dynamic vehicle provides the information needed to determine whether or not gimbal lock will occur at some later time. When gimbal lock is imminent, the inertial platform is commanded to a new \"safe\" orientation, and knowledge of the inertial reference is updated accordingly. By iterating this process gimbal lock protection is extended to a vehicle subjected to torques. The results of digital simulations using the Apollo Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System as a model are presented for various dynamic situations."
"Current and projected system requirements for inertial reference assemblies emphasize high accuracy, long life, and low power. An inertial reference assembly ( IRA) which embodies the aforementioned characteristics was developed recently. Pulse rebalanced gas-bearing gyroscopes were used to attain high accuracy and long life. Temperature compensation of gyroscope parameters (in lieu of temperature control) and dual voltage spinmotor operation helped achieve low-power operation. The latter two items represent an advancement in the state of the art and form the subject of this paper. These techniques were used in the construction of a three-axis IRA with an operating power less than 50 watts. It has achieved 0.1 percent scale factor accuracy over a 60°F range."
  "A microwave interferometer which permits the measurement of phase shift in a plasma independent of propagation path attenuation over a 30-dB dynamic range is described. Results are presented from an experimental evaluation of measurement accuracy of the interferometer instrument."
"A recent work calculated the probabilities of detection and false alarm for the mean and median detectors for the log-normal and contaminated-normal descriptions of sea clutter. This correspondence extends the previous work by first calculating the performance of the trimmed-mean detector and then calculating the detection performance of all three detectors when the target exhibits Rayleigh fluctuations. Finally, a simple example is used to show that the optimal beamwidth of a radar need not be the smallest obtainable beamwidth."
"A numerical method is developed for the calculation of steady-state FM distortion in a linear passive network from the character of the FM signal input and the steady-state transfer characteristics of the network. The method of calculating FM distortion requires the solution of a finite set of linear equations which is accomplished readily by a digital computer. To illustrate the use of the method, the FM distortion introduced by a Chebyshev-response bandpass filter is calculated for a range of network and input signal parameters."
 "Variations in apparent target direction, or glint, as sensed by an amplitude monopulse tracking antenna are analyzed for several cases when a nonuniform wave is incident on the antenna. Results are given for a target consisting of two isotropic scatterers, and compared with results previously obtained for the case of a locally uniform wave incident on the antenna."

 "Outdated and rigorous curricula are not only producing engineers unsuited to the challenges of the 1970's, but they are scaring off many of the most creative and intelligent students. Engineering education has become an endurance test; the excitement has been lost. Most students strive only to get out. Engineering schools have not yet realized the importance of the involvement of engineers in current environmental problems. They continue to present only the dry technical courses and seem unconcerned about the student's sense of social perspective or his motivation. This paper proposes a freshman awareness seminar plus project oriented learning in the following years as a remedy for this sad situation."
"A practical method of allocating the system maintainability (M) requirement to lower functional equipment levels is described. The use of this method minimizes trial and error in establishing values for each equipment item and the amount of tradeoffs required in apportionment relative to equipment complexity and M design characteristics. It has flexibility in application in that it can provide initial allocations at the conceptual design stage and updated allocations at various stages of design when more is known about a given system. The method will prove practical if the system requirement is practical and if the basic k factor tables are reasonably correct. If the system requirement is unrealistic, no method of allocation could make it realistic."
"The electronic communication technology available today offers the possibility of changing many patterns of information transfer in urban areas. There are three major trends which are converging to make this change possible. These are: 1) the technology to permit wideband information transfer manifested in the existing 2300/CATV/Cable System and in modification of the Bell network for wideband services; 2) the potential demand for a vast range of new services to persons operating in the urban areas; 3) the increasing demands for meeting mobile information transfer needs in the urban areas through radio systems operating in the 100 to 1000 MHz part of the spectrum. The extent to which these trends are allowed to converge will be a function of the quality of telecommunication policy formulation and execution. In order to formulate policy, it is necessary to have a vision of the future toward which to work. This paper will discuss the types of services possible with the technology presently available, which will have impact on future policy decisions."
"A review of activities in the solar cell field by the European manufacturers and agencies is presented. These activities include considerable efforts in research, development, and production of solar cells, covers, and solar cell arrays. Details of the qualification and use of European cells and covers on the Intelsat IV program are presented."
"Several different types of small silicon solar cell arrays mounted on lightweight honeycomb panels and on flexible substrates were subjected to long-term thermal cycling tests between -160 and 600C in dry nitrogen. Other tests included immersion in liquid nitrogen and vibration fatigue tests in excess of one million cycles. The arrays experienced a reduction in output caused by contact failure, fracture in the silicon and cover slide, and disintegration of the honeycomb. Failure modes caused by different cell and interconnect constructions are compared."
"The principle of parameter optimization of a linear time-invariant system via the second method of Liapunov is applied to optimize the parameters of a nutation damper suggested recently. Numerical results are derived, and it is indicated that the present values of optimum parameters agree closely with those obtained earlier by an approximate method."
"The error equations for a space-stable inertial navigation system are derived. This is done by directly perturbing the mechanization equations in the inertial frame and then transforming in open-loop fashion to the local-level frame. A rotating inertial platform and velocity and altitude damping are considered. The relations between errors in space-stable and local-level systems are noted. Numerical results are presented for certain random error sources."
"The resolution properties and clutter performance of a simultaneous Doppler and acceleration measurement are investigated in detail with particular emphasis given to coherent pulse trains. The analysis is based on the concept of a matched-filter receiver, although receiver weighting of the type that reduces Doppler sidelobes is also analyzed in detail. Near the main lobe of the acceleration response is a pedestal-ike sidelobe region, the height of which is about 1/N of the main response lobe power where N is the number of pulses in the train. The extent of this pedestal along the acceleration axis is proportional to N. The acceleration measurement in a clutter environment is best performed when both targets and clutter are confined to this pedestal region, since some response sidelobes outside of this region are extremely large."
"This paper represents a study of the trajectories of an ideal missile homing on a target according to the proportional navigation law. A qualitative study is performed and conditions are determined which enable one to demonstrate that: 1) the missile always reaches the target regardless of the initial conditions at launch; 2) the rotational rate of the line of sight is decreasing at the pursuit end."
"A method based on Hermite polynomials is developed for analysis of the output resulting from passing Fourier expandable signals and noise through general zero-memory devices. New results are developed for the output time and autocorrelation functions. Special results are generated for an ideal clipper. Techniques for obtaining results for practical cases are discussed. The method itself can be modified and applied to non-Gaussian noise and general nonlinear devices with nondeterministic signals."
"The derivation and the statistical properties of the maximum a posteriori probability phase estimator of a sinusoidal signal in white Gaussian noise are considered. The probability density function of the phase estimate is developed. The estimator efficiency and performance as a phase synchronizer in a partially coherent receiver are calculated and compared with a first-order phase-locked loop phase estimator."
"In linear transversal filters for signal processing, the impulse response of the filter is syntheszed in a sampled form by means of a tapped delay line with weighted and summed taps. The synthesis procedure consists of sampling the specified impulse response at appropriate intervals and using the sample values as the tap weights. A nonuniform sampling procedure for the synthesis of the impulse response is introduced, which can produce results more conveniently than the classical Shannon sampling procedure because of the simplicity of the transversal filter implementation. According to the new procedure, in the time domain the samples are taken at points where the instantaneous phase of the impulse response is a multiple of ir radians. The spectral distribution which ensues in the frequency domain consists of a series of spectra all having the same fractional bandwidth. The transversal filters synthesized by this sampling criterion are referred to as phase-sampled impulse response (PSIR) filters. An important application of PSI R filters is to the generation and matched filtering of a large class of AM and FM waveforms."
"Recursive methods are drived for computing detection probabilities for general fluctuating targets in Gaussian noise. For the generalized chi-square family of fluctuating targets, very simple and convenient recursive algrithms result. The methods are also extended to cell-averaging CFAR. Although the detection probability is expressed iw: terms of an infinite series, a convenient expression is derived for the resulting error when the series is truncated. Cell-averaging CFAR results are computed for nonfluctuating, Swering case I, and Swerling case II fluctuating targets."
"The coherent pulse train has good clutter suppression performance because the energy in its matched-filter response is essentially concentrated within sharp ambiguous spikes. However, this is so only when the Doppler distortions are neglected, so that the Doppler effect is taken as a simple translation of the carrier frequency. This paper analyzes the consequences of Doppler distortions on the resolution performance of pulse trains. It is found that Doppler distortions widen the Doppler ambiguities of the pulse train response, with the widening factor proportional to the order of the Doppler ambiguity. This reduces the interval between Doppler ambiguities, and hence the Doppler width of a clutter space that can be accommodated without severe clutter interference. For an operation in a Doppler-ambiguous mode, it also degrades nominal Doppler resolution performance. A detailed analysis of the effects is presented, and numerical results on the widening of the Doppler ambiguities are obtained."
"A suboptimum self bit synchronizer is considered that matches the signal shape, i. e., operates making a clever use of the knowledge of the signaling waveform. The noise performance of this system is analyzed for high signal-to-noise ratios, and an expression is obtained for the variance of the timing errors. This variance is compared with that of systems proposed by other authors on the basis of equal closed-loop noise bandwidth and equal signal shape. It is found that the use of this matched synchronizer enables appreciable timing jitter reductions."
   "The properties of an adaptive array antenna, including transient response rate and control loop noise, depend on the intensity of the external noise field. This dependence can be reduced by envelope hard limiting in the control loops, without degrading the performance of the adaptive array."
"The dynamics of an aircraft following a fixed course line using Loran-C for position fixing are shown to interact with Loran-C receiver dynamics to result in cross-track aircraft positioning errors that are smaller than cross-track Loran receiver errors. In a particular case considered, this error reduction is on the order of 50 percent."
 "The Siebert and the Dicke-fix CFAR radar detectors, used to maintain a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) in radar receivers under very similar circumstances, are considered. The Siebert detector represents the maximum-likelihood detection procedure for a signal in Gaussian noise of unknown power level, whereas the Dicke-fix makes use of a bandpass limiter to normalize the input and thus ensure a constant false alarm rate. The detection performance of the two detectors is determined and a comparison shows that over a wide range of parameters, the Dicke-fix introduces a loss which is approximately 1 B larger than for the Siebert detector."
"In a recent correspondence1 a calculation of the optimum bandwidth of a low-pass RC filter for the detection of a pulse signal in nonstationary noise was presented. The purpose of this correspondence is: 1) to point out additional references to the work which has been conducted in the stationary noise case, and 2) to present an interesting alternate derivation of the expected output noise power for the nonstationary noise case."
"Range acceleration introduces a coupling between range, Doppler, and range acceleration, with potentially severe consequences on radar performance. The following analysis of the effect shows that it is serious only when the radar uses a constant-carrier pulse or a waveform with small time-bandwidth product."
"The well-known relationship between the radar cross section and the volume of the target for Rayleigh scattering situations is extended to permit the direct estimation of the target's diameter for a variety of shapes. It is concluded that for objects of length-to-diameter ratios between one and five and for aspects within 300 of \"nose-on\" the diameter should be determinable to within at least 50 percent if the frequency is selected in the Rayleigh region for the target being observed."
"The analysis presented in a correspondence by Park1 contains a fundamental error in both the integrate-and-dump and the band-limit/sample detectors. In essence, the effect of intersymbol interference is disregarded on the basis that its average effect is not of concern here. It is the average probability of bit error that is important, where the average is taken over the error probabilities resulting from all possible combinations of a string of 2N pulses, N pulses on each side of the pulse under detection, regardless of how large N is. That is to say, if Pe is the average bit-error probability, Pei is the bit-error probability for a specific bit pattem, n is the noise, and Si is the specific pattern, then Pe = Pei(niSi) where x is the expected value of x. But this is definitely not equal to Pe(niSi), as is claimed by Park."
"The transient performance of a phase-locked loop on board a tumbling satellite is discussed. The probability of maintaining the in-ock condition during the tumbling mode as a function of time is presented in graphical form as a function of the following parameters: signal-to-noise ratio, the fade modulation factor, and the loop bandwidth."

   "Technology's prime mover in our culture is that special combination of management and engineering talents called the entrepreneur. The name is usually applied to the individual who has already made his move into organizationally independent status. The latent entrepreneur is here defined to be the same type, but one still buried in his parent organization. This paper discusses ways in which industry can foster and use the special self-motivating characteristics of such individuals during their latent stage. Entrepreneurship is a combination of full personal commitment to exploiting a perceived opportunity, the vision of a service to provide to society, and the placing of higher value on the free exercise of talents than on security. When employed in management of an existing company, the \"captive entrepreneur\" is the one who moves out against the organizational boundaries, and stretches his limits of authority. If his career satisfactions are not sufficient to him, he will bolt. The challenge to industry is to use this entrepreneurial drive. There appear to be sufficient advantages to industry to make the effort one of \"enlightened self-interest\"."
"Various solar cell interconnector designs are analyzed for fatigue failures under extended temperature cycling. Test results are presented for several configurations. The stresses and failures of the solder joint between interconnector and silicon cell are discussed in light of test results, new long-term cycling data showing much greater incipient failures than previously expected based on extrapolation. Data are also presented for solder creep strength at elevated temperatures. A comparison between soldered and welded joints shows that both approaches have their weaknesses. The bonding method of cells to substrate must be integrated with the interconnector design to obtain optimum performance, mechanically as well as electrically."
"The prime purpose of this paper is to describe the advances in Zener diode transient suppressors for ground vehicle and aircraft application. The evolution of the transient suppressor development for the U.S. Army is presented with emphasis on space, weight, and cost considerations. Improvements including an electronic thermal switch and a \"battle override\" switch are also described. A futuristic transient suppressor of modular design developed for use as an integral part of the equipment being protected is functionally described."
"The general (nth order) phase-locked loop is analyzed, of which the amplitude is not constant. The input carrier signal is amplitude-modulated by wide-band stationary Gaussian noise, and the signal, superposed with the additive white stationary Gaussian noise, enters the nonlimited phase-locked loop. Under the above assumptions the loop can be shown to constitute an n-dimensional vector Markov process, so that the process satisfies the n-dimensional Fokker-Plank equation. The probability density function depends on the effective loop signal-to-noise ratio and the effective modulation power."
"Radio direction-finding techniques that use amplitude-trigonometric interpolation between signals received at a circular antenna array are reexamined. The accuracy of this class of direction-finding system is limited by interpolation, gain mistracking, and additive-noise errors. The channel gain mistracking error is shown to be significantly lower than previously estimated. Typical calculations show that the trigonometric interpolation technique is an order of magnitude more accurate than previously supposed."
"A survey of the subject of unified control systems for the guidance of unmanned vehicles, such as pilotless aircraft and satellites, is presented. Unified refers to the fact that the tracking, telemetry, and command functions are all performed using a single RF channel and, at least ideally, a single set of equipment. The principles are outlined, followed by descriptions of several novel applications to the control of multiple vehicles. Examples based upon existing systems also are provided."
"This paper presents a detailed development of the equations of motion for the stable member of a three-axis platform. Kinematic relations are presented for an x, z, y Euler sequence. This development includes the effects of friction, inertia, and torque motors. A set of six first-order differential equations of state are presented representing the equations of motion of the system members. These equations may be integrated and the resulting Euler angles and rates used to describe the stable member motions. When combined with the servo loops, the motion of the stable member represents the angular motion environment of the stable member mounted instruments."
"This paper considers the problem of guiding N interceptors so that they intercept or rendezvous with N targets at the same time T. It is assumed that the interceptors and targets are described by linear time-varying differential equations (deterministic or stochastic). Under certain assumptions both the optimal (static or dynamic) interceptor-target allocation and the guidance of each interceptor for the optimal allocation can be obtained with modest real-time and storage computer requirements."
"The computed performance of four different types of glide slope transmitting arrays sited over idealized ground planes consisting of one-dimensional perfectly conducting strips of various lengths in free space is presented. The idealized ground plane approximates the practical case of a site consisting of an expanse of relatively flat ground plane ending in a precipitous dropoff or in rough diffusely reflecting terrain. The computed results show several phenomena which have repeatedly been observed."
"Recent interest in direct-ranging navigation methods has prompted new research into practical receiver structures which provide improved signal processing. Maximum likelihood receivers are compared with conventional phase-locked receivers by theoretical and simulation methods as phase estimators based on signal measurements only. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement is examined and filter recommendations made. An adaptive maximum likelihood receiver is then developed which uses both signal measurements and a priori data to improve phase estimation accuracy. Simulation results indicate a 33.3 dB processing gain yielding a ranging error standard deviation of ±15 feet for zero dB received SNR. Nonadaptive and adaptive receivers are fabricated, flight tested, and experimental results reported."
"Doppler satellite navigation relies on an initial position estimate with an iterative solution. A closed-form solution of this problem, which forms the basis of a complete analytic treatment, is presented. The solution is exact for arbitrary satellite orbits with an ellipsoid Earth model."
"Considerable progress has been made in the past few years toward understanding and solving the spacecraft communications blackout problem caused by the reentry plasma sheath. A summary of the causes and effects of the reentry plasma sheath is presented, together with a discussion of reentry plasma diagnostic techniques, proposed methods of alleviating the communications blackout, and a review of the reentry flight experiments performed to better our understanding of the reentry plasma."
"The tracking of synchronous satellites to provide propagation delays for the synchronization of clocks is described. The tracking is accomplished by range measurements to the satellite from three stations using signals transponded by the satellite. These same signals also functioned as the timing signals for the synchronization of other stations' clocks. Although the range measurements were of low resolution by usual standards, approximately 3000 meters, they provided the delays necessary to synchronize clocks to 40 microseconds or better. These results were obtained over a 4-month period using two satellites with measurements from five stations in the United States and South America."
"The Walsh spectrum of a sinusoid of frequency f = p/2q with p odd consists entirely of lines at orders s that are odd multiples of 2/2q, and the Fourier spectrum of a Walsh function of order 2p/2q consists entirely of lines at frequencies that are odd multiples of 1/2q. For all other frequencies or orders, the spectrum contains no lines, but the power spectral density takes all values in the range [0,oo] in every interval, however short, while being almost everywhere zero. For detecting the presence of a sinusoid by means of Walsh analysis, the time scale should therefore be chosen so that the order of the Walsh function is a power of 2 and the Walsh function is a Rademacher function, i.e., a hard-limited sinusoid of the frequency being sought."
"The performance of several sequential procedures for the following multiple-decision problem is investigated. Samples from k random processes (or populations) are available, k at a time (one from each process), to a receiver or data processor. One process contains a signal; the other k - 1 are statistically identical noise. The receiver is to select the odd process (locate the signal), with prescribed probability of error. The optimal receiver makes the selection in minimum average time. Analytical and Monte Carlo computations were performed under the hypothesis that the processes sampled are Rayleigh; however, a method for extrapolating results to other cases is given. The parameter k is allowed to vary from 2 to 1000."
"This paper develops an analytical, algebraic formalism that predicts effects induced in ring lasers by phase modulation, corresponding both to mode-decoupling mechanisms deliberately incorporated in the ring laser and to naturally occurring periodic or random angular or linear accelerations. The analysis is based on an approach that seems potentially convenient in the analysis of other systems that are physically stable but mathematically nonlinear."
"The influence of increasing range resolution on the detectability of targets with dimensions greater than the resolution cell is studied. An N-cell target model is assumed, which contains k reflecting cells, each reflecting independently according to the same Rayleigh amplitude distribution. It will be referred to as the (N,k) target. Detection based on one transmitted pulse is performed against a background of white normal noise. Detection in stationary clutter is also considered. The optimum detector is obtained but, in view of its complexity, the performance of a simpler detector, the square-law envelope detector with linear integrator (SLEDLI), is analyzed, and a formula for the probability of detection is obtained. Graphs are presented which show the probability of detection as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (\u007fSNR) for various values of N k, and false alarm probability. For N/k not too large it is shown that the SLEDLI is near optimum."
"A periodic FM altimeter is postulated and its illuminated area target modeled as an array of elemental scatterers. A computational form is then developed expressing the desired post mixer spectrum as a sum of spectral components corresponding to the individual scatterer returns. Application of the model is made to the case of a triangular linear sweep FM altimeter and samples of the calculated post mixer spectrum presented, illustrating the effects of antenna beam geometry, target surface properties, and modulation parameters."
"A nonparametric procedure used in a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) radar extractor for detecting targets in a background of noise with unknown statistical properties is described. The detector is based on a generalization of the well-known two-sample sign test and thus requires a set of reference noise observations in addition to the set of observations being tested for signal presence. The detection performance against Gaussian noise is determined for a finite number of observations and asymptotically, for both nonfluctuating and pulse-to-pulse Rayleigh fluctuating target statistics. It is noted that the performance loss, as compared to the optimum parametric detector, depends critically on the number of reference noise observations available when the number of hits per target is not large. In the same case a much larger loss is also found for a pulse-to-pulse fluctuating target even though the asymptotic loss is the same as for a nonfluctuating target. A comparison is finally made with a detector based on the Mann-Whitney test, which usually is considered to be one of the better nonparametric procedures for the two-sample case."
"The detection of signals in an unknown, typically non-Gaussian noise environment, while attempting to maintain a constant false-alarm rate, is a common problem in radar and sonar. The raw receiver data is commonly processed initially by a bank of frequency filters. The further processing of the outputs from the filter bank by a two-sample Mann-Whitney detector is considered. When the noise statistics in all filters are identical, the Mann-Whitney detector is distribution free, i. e., the false-alarm probability may be prescribed in advance regardless of the precise form of the noise statistics. The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the potential advantage of nonparametric detectors over conventional detectors. The signal detection performance of the Mann-Whitney detector is compared to that of an ordinary linear envelope detector plus integrator in the presence of Gaussian and several hypothetical forms of non-Gaussian noise. This comparison is made for both uniform and nonuniform distributions of noise power across the filter bank. Besides providing a much more constant false-alarm rate than the conventional detector, the Mann-Whitney detector's signal detection performance is found also to be much less sensitive to the form of the noise statistics. In one case, its detection sensitivity is found to be 11 dB better than that of the conventional detector. Even when the noise power density is made moderately nonuniform across the filter bank, the detection performance of the Mann-Whitney detector is found not to be significantly affected."
"The analysis and design procedure of an antenna for a CW Doppler radar system being developed for pilot warning of midair collision hazards is presented. The antenna consists of two vertical arrays of half-wavelength dipoles mounted near a circular conducting cylinder. Each vertical array is composed of three vertical dipoles. Each array provides relatively uniform illumination (2-3 dB) in the forward 180 angular segment of the horizontal plane and approximately + 10-150 coverage in the vertical plane. The antenna could be used in a two-mode operation, either in a standard monopulse radar system (sum and difference amplitude patterns) or in a system where amplitude and phase are the measurable quantities."
"A finite memory smoother which can be described by a set of weighting coefficients on the input measurements is derived. The smoother is a very simple structure incorporating all the sophistication of the underlyirig Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms. The limitations of the smoother are outlined. It is shown how the simple smoother structure can be exploited in performing straightforward smoothing sensitivity analysis. An application of applying the finite memory smoother to the evaluation of ship's inertial system velocity errors is described."
"The MULTIPAC is a central data system developed for deep-space probes with the distinctive feature that it may be repaired during flight via command and telemetry links by reprogramming around the failed unit. The computer organization uses pools of identical modules which the program organizes into one or more computers called processors. The interaction of these modules is dynamically controlled by the program rather than hardware. In the event of a failure, new programs are entered which reorganize the central data system with a somewhat reduced total processing capability aboard the spacecraft. As an example of one MULTIPAC configuration, a 16-watt system with 12 288 words of memory would have extensive data processing capability for variable data formatting, data sampling, converting analog information from experiments, and performing data reduction on experimental data to improve information transfer on a limited capacity telemetry channel. Emphasis is placedon the evolution of the system architecture and the final overall system design rather than the specific logic design."
"A major development in test philosophy of aircraft being built today and those being designed for the immediate future is the incorporation of on-board, computer-controlled \"built-in\" testing (BIT) into the airplane as part of the avionic subsystem. A requirement being imposed by today's specifications is a probability of 0.95 or better that the BIT function will detect a failure. The discussion presented in this paper will show that a single specification of BIT capability is insufficient to completely define the requirements for BIT. The proof of this conclusion is offered in the form of an analysis of the conditional probabilities involved in the occurrence and reporting of subsystem failures. As a result of this analysis it is imperative that the customer be cognizant of the significance of the BIT requirements levied on the contractor and that the designer be allowed more latitude in his BIT requirements so that an optimum product will be obtained."
"Properly designed phase-locked loops play a key role in deep-space communication links. The interrelationships among the loop band-width, acquisition time, and the loop signal-to-noise ratio are established for a given probability of acquisition. The Doppler rate tracking capability of the second-order loop is considered. The probability of time to lose lock is derived by the Fokker-Planck techniques. The results of the study are used to determine the loop bandwidth and the signal-to-noise ratio requirements of Venus and Jupiter probes' communication links."
"The effect of coefficient rounding in digital filters using floating-point arithmetic is analyzed. An error is defined as the difference between the output of a digital filter realized with a finite number of bits and the output of the same filter using infinite number of bits. It is shown that this error consists of two uncorrelated components. One component is due to the rounding of the arithmetic operations alone, and the other component represents the additional error due to coefficient rounding. Expressions are derived for the mean-square value of the error for the three canonical programming forms. The stability problem is studied by examining the shift of the pole locations due to the coefficient rounding. The mean-square value of the shift is calculated. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results is obtained."
   "The rms bearing error for simultaneous or sequential lobe comparison is found for a nonscanning, nontracking receiving system having two antenna (or transducer) lobes of arbitrary shapes. Simple, useful approximations are found for bearings both away from and near a null of one of the lobes."
"The above paper contains a misleading calculation of the mean of the output of a logarithmic detector whose input is a sine wave plus Gaussian noise. In this correspondence the nature of the inaccuracy is described, an exact expression for the mean is derived, and asymptotic expressions for the cases of low signal-to-noise and high signal-to-noise are obtained and compared to the previous result."
"From measurements of pulse amplitudes and normalized error signals made with a conventional monopulse radar it is possible in theory to determine the angular coordinates of the midpoint of two unresolved targets and the slope of the line joining them. Under special conditions it is also possible to determine the angular locations of the individual targets."
"A formula is derived for the probability of pulse coincidence in an arbitrary radar environment. From this, the frequency of occurrence of composite pulses is found."

"Consider γ as the angle between the beam and boresight of a phased-array radar. A simple explanation is given of the beam broadening along γ, and in proportion to secant γ. This leads to a concise consideration of polar sin γ space, sine-squared space, and some associated properties. Physical relationships are depicted, without unnecessary mathematical vigor."
"This paper discusses the concept, design, and design verification of the White Sands Range and Range-Rate System. Development of the system has been completed only through the design phase. The system is designed to meet requirements for high-accuracy midcourse tracking under severe target dynamics at the White Sands Missile Range. It is a multistatic Doppler and range tracker which operates at X band and incorporates transmitter, transponder, receiver, and baseline subsystems. The transmitter includes specially designed digital circuitry to synthesize test signals for target simulation during checkout of the system. The transponder signal is processed by a receiver which has been established theoretically to be the optimum realizable processor of continuous tracking data. The receiver incorporates specially designed carrier acquisition circuitry and digital VCO, and directly provides digital Doppler and tone phase data to facilitate real-time processing. The system utilizes data from other tracking systems at the Range for spatial acquisition, for aiding carrier acquisition in the receiver, and for resolving range ambiguities."
"Radar measurement and resolution performance, as well as target detection in clutter, depend largely on the transmitted waveform. This explains the sizable effort that has gone into studies of radar waveforms, including attempts at the synthesis of optimum waveforms. This paper shows that, despite the unlimited variety of radar signals, waveform selection is a straightforward process. There are only four classes of waveforms, each with distinct resolution properties. When the target environment is analyzed for a particular application, it is rather evident which of these classes will fit the situation best. Choice of the specific waveform within the selected class then is merely a matter of practical implementation. Although the facts used in developing the unified theory of this paper are not new, it is demonstrated that these facts can be combined into an extremely simple theory of waveform design. Much of today's work is guided by past approaches to a particular problem, and when a design is completed there may be a question as to how close to the optimum it is. The theory presented here permits a systematic approach to waveform selection, with the important benefit that the designer knows exactly where and how much he may have deviated from the best design, and why this was done."
"The utility of Barker-type phase-reversal codes is extended by the use of sidelobe suppression techniques that can be easily implemented in digital form. It is shown that sidelobe suppression techniques can be found where the tapped delay line used to reduce the sidelobes has only a few distinct tap weights, in which case the complexity of the digital processor is greatly reduced. An example is given where the technique is applied to Barker codes with positive sidelobes, specifically, the 13-element Barker code. If higher pulse compression factors are desired than are obtainable with Barker codes, multistage Barker codes may be used. The sidelobes then may be suppressed for any one or all of the different coding stages."
"The clutter performance of coherent pulse trains is examined when the duration of the pulse train is increased to values for which range acceleration effects must be taken into account. The problem of target detection against a clutter background with differential Doppler is studied in terms of the range acceleration effects on the conventional Doppler response. Specifically considered are the consequences on the sidelobe level and width of the main Doppler lobe. The analysis shows that the sidelobe level remains essentially unchanged when the range acceleration mismatch becomes significant. However, the main Doppler response broadens in proportion to the magnitude of the acceleration mismatch. Thus, an increase of the signal duration for better Doppler resolution is useful only until acceleration effects spread the Doppler spectrum of the clutter and eliminate the differential Doppler between targets and clutter."
"Detectability of periodic and synchronously recurrent transient signals in a noisy environment in which the noise power is time varying is investigated. For at least one noise model, it is shown that the basic nonlinearity of the optimum detector is a limiter. Performance of this optimum detector is compared with analog cross-correlation and clipper cross-correlation (CCC) detectors. It is shown that the CCC performs nearly optimally, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios, and that its performance is significantly better than that of the analog cross correlator."
"The problem of scheduling radar tracking pulses in a dense target environment where the position estimation error must be constrained to avoid false return with track correlations is considered. The problem is to schedule n fixed energy pulses such that the rangerate error is minimized at some final time subject to the constraint that the position error will be smaller than some value for the whole time interval. For a fixed time interval, the problem of finding the minimum number of radar measurements required to satisfy the position estimation error constraint is solved. A closed-form solution for the optimum schedule is given in the case where the number of pulses is equal to the minimum number of pulses. For cases where one extra pulse is available, a solution method is described and an algorithm is derived."
"The usual methods of reducing multipath angle errors in monopulse tracking radar achieve only limited success because they do not attack the root of the problem. A more correct approach is to accept the multipath signal as a second target and utilize a two-target signal processor which angle tracks both wavefronts. The processor will decouple the return signals so that relatively interference-free data on both waves are obtained. In this paper a signal processor for separating signal from (N - 1) multipath components is developed. The processor is then specialized to the case of only one multipath signal and evaluated by a computer simulation. Data show that large improvements are possible as compared to the usual monopulse tracking system. In particular, the usual large bias errors at low elevation angles are eliminated. Tracking precision compares favorably with the theoretically best possible for two-target tracking systems."
"Two methods of measuring the drag of bodies in a low-density gas stream are described. The supersonic stream had a mean free path as great as 4 cm, and the drag forces were small. A drag balance was adapted from an electrical analytical balance to measure forces up to 70 dynes with less than 1-percent error. With this balance, the drag of spheres was measured for the Knudsen number range from 1.0 to 5. The freedrop trajectory method yielded drag coefficients in the range of Knudsen numbers from 2.5 to 30. These tests demonstrated the feasibility of making accurate drag measurements under the free-molecule conditions that can be generated by exhausting a gas into a cryogenically pumped vacuum chamber."
"A comparison of the error propagation in a local-level reference frame is derived for two inertial navigation systems; one has a local-level configuration, and the other has a space-stable configuration. The error propagation is shown to be equivalent for the two cases considered. This equivalence is demonstrated by starting with the error propagation equations for the space-stable system and transforming them to a local-level reference frame. The transformed equations are then compared with the classical local-level error equations, and the equivalence is noted. The specific implementation used in each case considers velocity damping but not altitude damping."
"Inertial navigators determine inertial altitude and vertical velocity by a closed feedback loop in which the vertical accelerometer output is mixed with a pressure altitude reference. Pressure altitude is determined as a function of presure based on the standard atmosphere models. Since the atmosphere is almost always nonstandard, large inertial altitude and vertical velocity errors may result. A unique algorithm has been devised to compute a dynamically corrected altitude reference by numerically integrating the physical relation for a column of air as a function of pressure, gravity, and absolute temperature. The new algorithm has been flight tested and has been shown to yield accurate results."
"The design concept for the traveling wave tube amplifier converter for possible use in the Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft (TOPS) is presented. An unusual combination of semiconductors and magnetics were utilized to achieve very stable voltage regulation on a number of separate outputs to satisfy the requirements of a high-power traveling wave tube (TWT), and at the same time operate at an efficiency of better than 90 percent from a 30-volt source. The circuitry consists of an output filter, an auxiliary Jensen oscillator driving a high-reactance transformer to provide current limiting to the heater, a variable time delay, a main Jensen oscillator driving the power transformer with a maximum step-up ratio of 120 to 1, and series transistorized post regulators to provide precise voltage adjustment and low output impedance. This paper discusses the design of the high-reactance transformer and the high step-up ratio transformer, as well as the high-voltage series regulators that are limited in range and operate at the top of the unregulated output voltage. Test data is presented, and details of current transients caused by charging the filter circuits, input current ripple, and output voltage ripples are considered. The circuit provides better than 0.5 percent regulation against load change, input voltage change, and over-operating temperature range of from -20 to + 80°C, with output ripple voltage of less than 2 volts peak-to-peak on top of the 3600-Vdc output. The measured efficiency was typically 87 percent. and recommendations are included to improve this to in excess of 90 percent."
"The transcalent rectifier can dissipate power losses while rectifying 250 amperes; it rectified 60-Hz alternating current at conduction angles of 180°, 120°, and 60°, and at frequencies varying from 200 to 2600 Hz at a conduction angle of 180°. It was surge-current tested to a peak of 6500 amperes, life tested for 4108 hours, and cycle-life tested for 10 867 cycles while rectifying 250 amperes of current. The transcalent rectifier dissipates heat more effectively and at lower junction temperature than conventional rectifiers as heat is transferred isothermally by vaporization of liquid in the heat pipe. Operational characteristics are: a thermal impedance of 0.030 C/W between junction and fins; a thermal impedance of 0.21 C/W between fins and ambient; a junction operating at 1300C; size less than 14 cubic inches; and weight less than 10 ounces."
"Many future satellite configurations will require the transfer of signals and power across rotating interfaces. Satellite systems are particularly cost effective for both commercial and military communications applications if their useful lifetime can be demonstrated to be greater than five years. The rotary transformer has the desireable characteristics of high reliability and low noise which qualify it as a potential replacement for slip rings. This paper describes the development of a rotary transformer for typical spacecraft applications. The transformer is built in modular sections, each capable of transferring 500 watts across a gap at efficiencies greater than 88 percent, dc to dc. The design effort included a study of pertinent electrical characteristics required for typical spacecraft configurations, electrical design and analyses of the overall dc-dc converter, mechanical design of the transformer cores and their assembly, and a study of transformer core and winding characteristics. Breadboard test results have demonstrated the desired level of efficiency, satisfactory operation over temperature, and satisfactory electrical characteristics."
"Power hybrid microelectronic design techniques have been developed to satisfy the requirements of 10-ampere 100-watt series voltage regulators. Application of these new techniques has resulted in a package occupying roughly the same volume as a TO-63 power transistor, yet containing two 30-ampere power transistors, selectable external components, and associated control circuitry."
"A method is presented to calculate the output of a hard limiter if the input consists of a superposition of three phase-coded signals. A detailed investigation is made of the case where the limiter input signals are phase reversal modulated according to a maximum length linear code. It is shown in this case that a false target signal is generated at the limiter output. The amplitude distribution of the false target signal is investigated along with the distribution of the captured true target signals. A digital computer simulation confirms the theoretically predicted effects."
"Aspects of high-power high-voltage power conditioner design and weight estimation relevant to space subsystems are discussed. Weight has become an increasingly important parameter with the advent of larger and more sophisticated spacecraft, especially those for high-power communication. A computer program for estimating the weight of a high-power dc-to-dc power conditioner as functions of output power, operating frequency, input voltage range, maximum input voltage, and efficiency, respectively, is described, including computer-aided design of inductors and transformers. Curves of typical power conditioner weight as functions of the preceding parameters, derived from the power conditioner weight program, are presented."
"An analytic solution is obtained for the three-dimensional heat diffusion equation applied to a model for a multifinger power transistor. It predicts that the thermal instability takes place based on localized heating and positive feedback. The condition of thermal stability found by Navon and Miller [1] differs from that encountered in this paper."
"Both uniform temperature distribution and crowded temperature distribution for a large-geometry power transistor are studied. Different concepts are used for calculating these two types of temperature distribution. In the first instance, in order to calculate the uniform temperature distribution, it is assumed that the power is uniformly dissipated over the entire emitter surface. In the second instance, in calculating the crowded temperature distribution, the power dissipation is assumed to be concentrated at the edges of the emitter. The time-dependent diffusion equation is solved to calculate the temperature rises in these two cases."
 "Photocount distributions for a narrow-band laser receiver in thermal background radiation are developed in a parallel sense to the envelope density functions for radio frequency radar. While classical detection performance is dependent on the received signal-to-noise, the results show that narrow-band photocount detection additionally depends on the absolute levels of the received signal and noise."
"An anechoic chamber used for missile test or simulation inherently adds boresite error, generally as a result of sidewall reflections. A simple method of analysis shows this error depends on the sidewall angle of arrival through the antenna difference pattern and the bistatic reflection coefficient of the sidewall material. This material coefficient which is seldom measured is of critical importance."
"A synthetic aperture radar system is described which is suited to the target classification role and has a minimum data storage requirement. The corresponding data processor can employ the fast Fourier transform technique."
"From a set of N statistically independent Gaussian random variables, N correlated log-normal random variables may be generated to represent the amplitude of correlated clutter signals. Means are developed to realize specified mean value and covariance matrices of the desired clutter correlated log-normal variables. The realization is in the form of a weighting matrix to produce a set of correlate Gaussian random variables which become log-normal after a suitable nonlinear transformation."
"A simple criterion is defined which allows a quick estimate of a radar's capability to resolve two targets with differential motion. The criterion is applicable to general types of target motion, and hence will yield nominal resolution performance for arbitrary systems that utilize relative motion, such as synthetic aperture radar or inverse synthetic aperture radar, Doppler filters, systems that make use of target spin, and so forth. The criterion is considered both for weighted and unweighted signals."

     "Evidence gathered from experiments with bulk InP shows that both domain and higher frequency, current controlled, instabilities can occur. Device results show typically broad tuning ranges centred on a frequency well above the domain frequency suggesting that the mode of operation of devices relates more to the higher frequency modes observed in bulk material. Theoretically, domain inhibition can result from a three level transfer mechanism, and accumulation modes seem naturally favoured. However, no direct confirmation of three level transfer yet exists. Devices have operated under pulsed conditions at frequencies up to 40 GHz; with efficiencies up to 8% at X band and 2% at Q band and CW operation has been obtained at Q band. These results suggest reasonable device prospects for InP."

The inclusion of broadband matching networks in the transistor package has yielded power amplifiers with several hundred MHz bandwidth. Solutions for some of the reliability problems; e.g., hot-spot formation, power imbalance, and metal migration, have been found."
 "With the recent advent of transistors which are capable of operating in the microwave frequencies, both bipolar and field-effect transistors are used to replace other microwave amplifiers. In this paper, the broadband design theory and some experimental results of microwave field-effect transistor (FET) amplifiers are presented. The basic elements used in these broadband amplifiers are microwave silicon and gallium-arsenide Schottky-barrier field-effect transistors. Analytical broadband matching techniques are used together with computer-aided optimization techniques in the design of these broadband microwave FET amplifiers."
   "The theory of array antenna design has matured such that the tools are now available to design elements with predictable performance and to verify this performance with high confidence. The antenna feed is of equal importance to the antenna element. Multiple reflections in a poorly designed feed may generate spurious responses in the array antenna pattern. Space feeds offer economy and simplicity but tend to be limited in instantaneous bandwidth, flexibility of amplitude tapers, and ability to form clusters of beams. The near field off-set fed Gregorian reflector system appears to eliminate much of the inflexibility of the more conventional space-fed systems. This system is an attractive potential feed for the all-solid-state, phased-array radar. The all solid-state phased array radar typically will have a larger aperture relative to its vacuum tube counterpart. This large aperture increases the likelihood of the need for time-delay steering and clusters of simultaneous receive beams."
   "The radiation performance of an experimental phased array has been investigated. The antenna system consists of a nine element X-band linear array, digital phase shifters and a beam steering computer. Beamwidth, gain and beam direction error have been evaluated versus scan angle for 3- and 4-bit phase approximation. Results for E- and H-plane scan are compared. A phase monopulse tracking system has been added to the antenna and beam steering logic. With this system tracking of several independent targets is possible. Search and track information may be displayed simultaneously. Examples of tracking performance with digital beam steering are given. The work reported is a part of a research program jointly carried out by the MI Division of L M Ericsson in Mölndal and the Division of Network Theory at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden."
   "The use of an hourglass reflector phased array is proposed for electronic despin of the communications antenna on a spin stabilized satellite. An analysis based on physical optics approximations is given, and calculated results presented for both half and full reflector cases. Measured patterns for a prototype with one feed element are compared with calculated results."
  "Tubular antennas derived from arrays of gaps in circular waveguide can be designed by a computer program operating on the gap interspacings and gap widths, and taking into account realistic features like external mutual coupling and finite tube wall thickness. Linearly polarised radiation makes these antennas candidates for radar applications and for microwave television transmitters."
                  "Measurements have shown that it is possible to increase the gain of the short backfire antenna significantly in different ways: 1.By increasing the size of the reflectors. 2.By placing extra reflectors in multiples of a half wave-length from the surface wave reflector. 3.By placing a quarter-wave ring in front of the surface wave reflector. The surface of the ring is perpendicular to the reflector and the ring has the same diameter as the reflector. The distance between the ring and the reflector giving maximum gain depends on the size and the number of reflectors. The choice of parameters (size of reflectors) was based on numerical calculations using a theory developed by Dragø Nielsen and Pontoppidan at this laboratory. Measurements have shown a decrease in impedance bandwidth when gain is increased. It is, however, possible to increase the gain-bandwidth product. The backward radiation is increased, too, but due to the quarter-wave ring the backlobe level is kept at an acceptable hight. The beamwidths in E- and H-plane tend to be equal with increasing gain. This is an advantage if circular polarization is wanted. The modified short backfire antenna seems to have a higher gain than any other backfire antenna of the same size (same length and diameter of the surface wave reflector)."

"This paper reviews the state of the art of methods and techniques suitable for use in the automatic optimization of microwave circuits by digital computer. A number of significant recent developments in the rapidly developing area of computer-oriented circuit theory and design which may be directly applied to high frequency or distributed circuits are emphasized. A fairly extensive classified bibliography on optimization methods and on some applications, primarily in the microwave area, is included. The principal aim of this paper is to bring the microwave circuit designer up to date with developments in computer-oriented optimization methods and techniques and their application to microwave circuit design. To achieve this, the state of the art is reviewed in a tutorial manner, highlighting the talk with material taken from a variety of recent research papers, published during the last year or so. Promising areas for future work are indicated. A fairly extensive classified bibliography on optimization methods and on some applications, primarily in the microwave area, concludes the paper. Papers and books not necessarily in the microwave area are referenced if it is felt that the subject matter is, nevertheless, relevant. The first question that a microwave circuit designer might have is what material should he read to convince himself that he can solve a wide variety of design problems using optimization techniques. Five articles [1]-[5] are referenced under the heading of Reviews of Network Optimization which should probably be found most useful."
            "This paper considers the various design procedures for microwave bandpass channel filters which are of sufficiently narrow fractional bandwidth such that they may be designed directly from low-pass prototypes. Initially, the more conventional forms are considered e.g., (Thompson, Butterworth, Chebychev, Elliptic Function etc.) and typical physical realizations are presented. However, for high capacity systems with narrow guard bands between channels, it is essential to turn to non-minimum phase structures to minimise distortion. Historically, the inclusion of all-pass delay equalizers in addition to the conventional minimum phase filters were the first practical non-minimum phase microwave devices. Recently, however, superior design procedures have become available with compact physical realizations in the microwave regions. These structures are considered in detail including very recent design work relating to the optimum design of channel filters for arbitrary modulated carriers. Experimental results verify that theoretical specifications may be met in practice with only a small increase in size and cost over unequalized conventional filters."

   "Many who handle electrical equipment mistakenly believe their tolerance to electric shock is related to their ability to withstand the pain of the shock. Actually, the lethal incidence is a function of current passage through the heart region, where there are no sensory nerves to detect pain. Additionally, the onset of possibly lethal currents is only marginally higher than those ranked just painful and well within the range of industrial low-voltage power systems. While asphyxiation is the physiological result of the first zone of over-painful shock, the second zone results in heart ventricular fibrillation, or heart disfunction. Not only is the latter nonself-curing on cessation of the current, but it is generally lethal within about 3 minutes. Constant awareness and specific safety instructions to those involved with electrical or electrically driven equipment, together with vigilant policing of the safety aspects of the equipment, are hallmarks in preventing personnel shock."

A brief discussion of each example is given, and typical results are described. Details are not given since that would require a separate paper for each example."

However, because such a plant is usually tied to a very weak power line, a motor selected by conventional methods is seldom acceptable. Such a motor would produce power surges intolerable to the utility. By using a wound-rotor motor, and by selecting the right combination of motor horsepower, inertia, and number of knives, it is possible to achieve the highest rate of production which does not produce unacceptable power surges. A method is presented to achieve this through simulation of the transient behavior of the chipper on an analog or a digital computer. Comparison of computer results against tests conducted on a long-log chipper shows good agreement."
"Optimal control of an actual plant is achieved without using computers or any instrumentation other than the basic minimum normally required for closed-loop control. Pontryagin's principle is found superior to dynamic programming in such applications. This principle is presented as a practical tool rather than a theoretical concept; and its use is extended to cover the infinite optimizing interval case. A practical example is described in which the optimizing controller is an inexpensive collection of commonly available electronic elements. The presentation is intended for the professional control engineer rather than the theoretical control scientist."
"The major differences between U.S. and foreign industrial control apparatus arise from differences in national standards. Some of these are a result of different electrical systems, and others because of different installation and service requirements. There are only minor differences between national standards of European nations for industrial control apparatus where such standards exist. The IEC recommendations are being generally adopted by most foreign nations, and while they have not yet been incorporated in U.S. standards, they will have a strong influence in the future."
"The need for conditioning the air in electrical control rooms by lowering the temperature and humidity and eliminating corrosive elements is emphasized. It will be shown how environmental control of this kind will increase the reliability of the equipment and extend its life expectancy. Certain electrical and mechanical considerations are presented to dramatize the various environmental conditions that exist in pulp and paper mills. A cost comparison is then developed for a typical control room based on three different approaches."
"The oscillator described provides a three-phase, variable-frequency output of reversible phase sequence. The output frequency can be continuously varied from 0 to 60 Hz, and the range may be easily increased to any desired value. The device has been used as a reference source in a cycloconverter scheme for the speed control of a 30-hp squirrel-cage induction motor. The oscillator can be directly used to control the speed of small ac motors. It can also be used in conjunction with cycloconverters or inverters to control the speed of large ac motors."
"The control by computer of the electrical demand due to two-position process ensembles of finite magnitude is discussed. The purpose of the computer control is, first, to minimize the total kW demand upon the generating equipment and, second, to maximize the generating plant utilization, as defined by the load factor (average load/maximum load). Where these two requirements conflict, the former is to take precedence. A mathematical analysis is given for a computer strategy where the incidence of the individual loads is symmetrically staggered to minimize the maximum demand. The number of processes to be controlled is in the range of 2-10, where the incidence of individual loads may be precisely defined, thus eliminating statistical considerations. In order to keep the analysis perfectly general, certain constraints have to be applied which in many cases are justifiable and realistic, although some plants have special requirements dictated by the process which require individual treatment. The constraints imposed are detailed within the text."
"Electrical distribution equipment is usually an integrated assembly containing various components, each with short-circuit ratings obtained under individual conditions but perhaps not valid in the actual application. It is difficult to obtain and properly evaluate all the ratings to ensure that the equipment is adequate for the system available fault current. Integrated equipment short-circuit ratings obtained from realistic testing of the complete equipment should be provided."
"Experimental work was carried out to determine the feasibility of detecting flames by means of an insulated wire grid placed over the entire surveillance area thus eliminating expensive individual detectors. By maintaining the umbrella grid at an electric potential, charged particles and ions are \"extracted\" from the flames. As they move toward the grid, they are deposited on the interposing surfaces and their accumulation is detected in the form of an electric current. To eliminate the effect of ambient ions which also act as an electric charge deposited on the same surfaces, as well as large charge accumulations due to the flames, the polarity of the grid potential is switched periodically. It is believed that the system would find applications in one-story residential homes with the grid mounted in the attic or roof. It would be energized only at nighttime because some of the appliances used during the day in a home may trigger the alarm."
"A new variable speed commutatorless electric drive system has been developed which has a speed-torque characteristic similar to that of a dc series motor. Efficient use of active material was attained by series connecting rotor and stator windings of the rotating machine and by achieving control over the torque angle relationship between rotor and stator MMF waves. Stabilized operation results from sensing shaft position (at any speed) by use of magnetodiodes and, through semiconductor logic, gating the thyristors of a 400-Hz three-phase half-wave cycloconverter in such a fashion as to maintain an essentially constant MMF torque angle. Energy return to the power system during the generating portion of each half-cycle was attained using magnetodiode current sensing and semiconductor logic. Experimental results obtained with a 5-hp machine correlate with analytical predictions."
"A fixed frequency pulsewidth modulated chopper scheme is utilized to obtain a variable dc voltage from a constant dc voltage source. The steady-state performance of a separately excited chopper-fed dc motor is analyzed by four different methods based upon the following assumptions: 1) negligible commutation interval; 2) negligible ripple in the armature current; 3) constant current during commutation; and 4) direct solution of the governing differential equations. The effect of increased armature circuit resistance due to pulsating armature voltage on the characteristics obtained is discussed. The results by method 4) are found to show good agreement with experimental values."
"Since in many applications of dc machines an accurate knowledge of the dynamic mathematical model is necessary, it is desirable to have simple measurement methods to obtain the different parameters required. A new approach of defining the electrical parameters of a dc machine is shown. The measurement techniques provide dynamic resistance and inductance characteristics which are shown to be very much off the usual values taken from a linear approximation. Resistance values are measured by modified voltage drop methods, and inductance values are measured by load current variations. In case of transient behavior, like sudden short circuits or sudden load variations, the linear model cannot be applied, and the dynamic resistance and characteristics used in the nonlinear differential equations describing the system provide a good model within experimental error. The results show in particular how the armature inductance is dependent on the load as well as on the speed of rotation."
"A mathematical analysis of coupled heat transfer and natural convection in an all-electric glass furnace was conducted using a two-dimensional computer model. The model simulated numerically the complex interactions which occur among energy, mass, and momentum transfer in a vertical plane section through the melter. Computer-generated isotherm and streamline contour maps are presented for each of twelve different cases of vertical and horizontal rod-electrode pair configurations on the centerline section of a hypothetical all-electric glass furnace. The total electrical power consumption was held constant in all cases to establish a basis for comparison of the results. It is shown that both the temperature distribution and the circulation flow pattern in a glass melt can be markedly influenced by the power density distributions associated with electrodes of different length and orientation."
"Only recently have SCRs become available which allow the economical design of power controllers at the current levels required for direct coupled booster melting in glass furnaces. Two electric booster melting systems utilizing these high-power SCRs are described and some of the advantages obtainable from their use, certain of the design criteria involved, and some operating experience over approximately 1 year of service are outlined."

"In this tutorial paper the authors review the interactions of man with machines from a hierarchical point of view. These interactions have been principally associated with utilization of machines until the last decade. During this latter period, the development of computers as data-processing and information-retrieval devices has evolved to a higher level of interactions. Several pertinent accomplishments and seemingly inherent problems associated with these developments are presented."
"Power-system analysis primarily consists of the techniques used to predict or improve the performance of an existing or proposed power system under specified conditions. These Techniques, when applied to industrial power systems, can contribute heavily to fulfillment of the goals of industrial-system design, such as safety, reliable service, high-power quality, and low initial and operating costs. Principal types of industrial-system studies include short circuit, protective device coordination, load flow, transient stability, motor starting, grounding, transient overvoltage, power-factor improvement, and miscellaneous design and application studies including combinations of the above. Power-system analysis should be applied whenever a new or revamped power system is being planned, when the load or capacity of an existing system is markedly changed, or when the existing system requires trouble-shooting."

"Polyphase induction motors used in static variable frequency drive systems are versatile torque transducers having operating characteristics and features which meet the requirements of modern variable speed drive systems. Some of these characteristics are the capability for operation at very low and high speeds, at high-torque overloads, in a constant horsepower versus speed mode, and in the negative torque range for regenerative and dynamic braking. Attractive features include the easy availability of wide ranges in horsepower, voltage, and speed ratings as well as varied construction configurations. Additionally, induction motors have size, weight, torque-to-inertia ratios, and certain cost advantages when compared to dc drive motors."
"Many characteristics of high-intensity discharge lamps such as arc luminance, color variations, the effects of operating position and ballasting, and the interaction of lamp and luminaire properties are important for system design and testing. However, these data are not as readily available as the normal lamp descriptions of luminous flux, physical size, etc. This is a tutorial paper that discusses the less frequently mentioned characteristics that are important for the proper use of high-intensity discharge lamps."
"The advantages and characteristics of sleeve bearings that make them the most frequent choice for large ac motors are discussed. Important considerations for selecting a bearing type are presented and discussed with the objective of providing helpful information to users of large ac machines."
"Many of today's specifications continue to limit the use of ball bearings on induction motor drives to on or below 200 hp. Advances in bearing technology and manufacture, along with increased bearing selection and application knowhow, have greatly increased the horsepower range over which ball bearings may be reliably used. Many performance and operational advantages are enjoyed through the use of ball bearings. With proper bearing selection and application, ball bearings can and are being successfully applied to motors as large as 2000 hp running at 3600 r/min with excellent results in bearing performance. With increased confidence in ball bearing reliability, acceptance of motor drives with these types of bearings should be greatly expanded in the immediate future."
"Effectiveness of supervisory control systems for pipeline application is discussed. An industry survey of 74 existing systems shows the relationship between costs and effectiveness. The results of the survey are discussed and compared to several reference articles on electronic system design and performance. A plan to predict cost effectiveness is shown. Improvements in supervisory control equipment performance could come from 1) integrated circuits, 2) parallel low-speed data paths, 3) code structure compatible with standard computer-communication interface practices."
"Control of the starting torque of textile machinery drives has become an important factor in the effective performance of textile machinery. Increased operating speeds to achieve greater production requires more precise acceleration of machine components to ensure efficient operation. Controlled acceleration also eliminates premature failure of the machine elements. Many factors must be considered in determining the optimum system for a given machine. Some of the applications in which controlled-torque systems could be used advantageously and some of the controlled-torque systems that are available are investigated."

Only a small percentage of the particles are charged directly by means of a light carriage supporting a grid of alternate corona and ground potential wires and traveling back and forth through the smoke and dust cloud."
"Torque pulsations in induction motors would have an average value of zero and therefore are generally neglected by inverter induction machine system designs. A simple equivalent circuit method is presented for estimating the magnitude of torque fluctuations under steady-state operating conditions based on single-phase equivalent circuits. The method indicates that torque fluctuations are due mainly to the interaction of fundamental flux in the air gap at harmonic rotor currents. Inverters producing a 6-stepped voltage waveform, the predominant pulsating torque is at the sixth harmonic and the magnitude of the fluctuation is independent of operating frequency, provided that constant volts per Hz is maintained. The method is extendable to PWM inverter-machine systems with similar conclusions with respect to variation of torque over the input frequency range. However, for the PWM inverter with a fixed number of pulses per cycle, the torque pulsations can approach or exceed full-load average torque. The method outlined is simple and amenable to hand calculations."
"A number of practices have been used to improve voltage regulation of electrical systems and equipment performance on farms. An increase of secondary voltages from 240/120 to 480/240 V would provide an even greater improvement and substantially reduce costs of secondary services for large installations. Farmsteads with large loads, long feeders and branch circuits, and those with scattered utilization points will receive the greatest benefits from higher farmstead voltages. Conductors, service equipment, and many utilization devices are commercially available for 480/240 V. Several types of three-phase and single-phase systems may be used with the higher voltage secondary system. Dry-type transformers would allow operation of present utilization devices requiring 240/120 V."

These laws impose various operating conditions. Some problems connected with the application of these synchronous actuators in speed control systems are discussed."
"Increasing awareness of industrial noise pollution and the sparsity of published literature on noise control of electric motors indicate the need for a comprehensive review of the problem as well as its solutions. Fundamental concepts of noise generation, propagation, and measurement are presented and historic limits are referred to.

The discussion covers the operational benefits of the fluidic systems under actual operating field experience."
"As the demand for crude oil and natural gas increases, the petroleum industry must endeavor to attain maximum producing capabilities at a reasonable operating cost. To achieve these results, computers are being employed in the field. Problems with early computer systems have generally occurred in the performance of end-element devices such as positive displacement meters, liquid level devices, and other conventional field equipment. New equipment concepts may be necessary to resolve some of the more troublesome problem areas."

Capability includes casualty prevention routines which monitor drilling parameters and provide alarms for prevention of blowouts, twist-offs, and stuck pipe."
"Utilizing electrically operated shutdown instrument systems on magneto powered gas engines has long required design compromises that affect reliability and safety. Utilizing magneto power to operate regulated dc power supplies, which in turn operate shutdown systems, is discussed. Using magneto driven dc power supplies, as compared to magneto energy directly, offers numerous operational and safety advantages."
"The application of modem electronics and computer technology to the automation of oil and gas producing operations has resulted in a tendency in many instances to \"over engineer\" the project designs. This has been a result of an attempt to take complete advantage of all the capabilities of these modem systems. The actual requirements of these systems as they are applied to oil and gas producing operations are placed in context. Based on a discussion of the data acquisition system and the petroleum environment, a conceptual approach to oilfield automation is presented."

"For wire-to-plane coronas in ambient air, the lateral distribution of current at the plane has been measured. To a first approximation, it has been found that for positive dc, negative dc, and 60-Hz ac coronas 1) the shape and width of the distribution curves are independent of polarity; 2) the shape and width of the curves are independent of current between 3 and 35 AA/cm; and 3) the width of the current distribution is directly proportional to the wire-to-plane spacing S. Specifically, if the \"beamwidth\" W of the current distribution is defined as the full lateral distance subtended at one half of the peak current, then W = 1.4 S."
"Pilot plant precipitators can usually operate at much higher voltages than the equipment they are meant to simulate. A possible reason for the difference in the sparkover voltage is the difference in the capacitance of the electrode systems. Experiments are carried out with apparatus which simulates the events leading to sparkover in an electrostatic precipitator. Curves of the relationship between sparkover voltage and capacitance are shown."
"Experiments were conducted to study the effects that a mechanical collector might have on sparkover voltage in an electro-static precipitator located downstream. The test equipment for determing sparkover voltage was designed to simulate the corona wires and collector plate of an electrostatic precipitator. The flyash that was used in all sparkover tests was collected from precipitator hoppers in systems where no mechanical collector had been installed."

"The electronic transformer is a device which behaves in the same manner as a conventional power transformer in that it steps voltage levels up or down while providing isolation and can accommodate load current of any power factor. It contains thyristor power switches which convert the low-frequency (dc to 400-Hz) voltage wave to a high-frequency (in the order of 10 000 Hz) wave. A comparatively small magnetic transformer then provides the voltage level transformation and isolation functions. Similar thyristor power switches then reconstruct the original low-frequency wave at the desired output voltage level. This device can incorporate additional features not found in a conventional transformer, such as current limiting and current interruption. The theory of operation is presented and confirmed by experimental data."
"Over a decade has passed since process computers were first applied to control parts of the cement manufacturing process. The path from there to the present has successes-and failures-along its way. Over 30 cement plants have installed such computers as part of their efforts to keep profit margins from shrinking. Progress in using these process control techniques has been largely evolutionary. Certain factors can now be identified more certainly as essential ingredients for success. Among these are the following. 1) \"People factors\" of the cement manufacturer stand as first in importance. These include management support, process know-how, training and supervision of operators, and an inner confidence and determination that \"we can make it work.\" 2) Well-done interface jobs of adapting control room design and operators to each other, automation components with the process and its machinery, and plant design to fit automatic control fundamentals. 3) Designing the process to really be controllable. 4) Control hardware and software which fit the nature of this industry. Each of the foregoing factors is expanded with emphasis on how recent developments of better understanding, control functions, hardware, software, and of process and plant design are merging to help shape the future of automation in the cement industry."
"Some useful techniques for the process analysis of cement kilns, related experience, and theoretical considerations are discussed in this paper. In the practical application of process analysis techniques-i.e., autocorrelation, spectral density analysis, crosscorrelation, scatter diagram, and estimation of impulse response by the use of the least-square method-the most important problem is how to treat the data prior to data analysis in order to minimize the effect of noise. The data gathered directly from a kiln contains, in many cases, two kinds of noises-trend and high-frequency noise-and the most useful information lies in the medium-frequency range. In our process analysis system, the high-frequency noise within the range 0.01-60 Hz is eliminated by the use of non-linear analog filters specially developed during the data acquisitions. Remaining high-frequency noise and trend are eliminated by digital filters, i.e., high-pass and low-pass filters, respectively. If these filters and process analysis techniques are applied properly, remarkably clear relationships are obtained among the kiln data, notably: clinker quality, burning-zone temperature, kiln drive torque, secondary air temperature, etc. In the technical theory it is proved that the application of filters does not alter the estimated process characteristics when the same filter is applied to both input and output data of the process to be analyzed. Concerning the estimation of the impulse response, very important considerations are the selection of the data sampling interval, the length of response to be estimated, and feedback loops contained in the process itself."
"Induction motors with variable frequency are becoming more widely used for variable speed drives. These motors may operate over a wide torque and speed range. By an adjustment in voltage and frequency, a motor can be made to operate at the minimum loss for any torque and speed. Equations and curves are developed to find the voltage and frequency to produce the minimum loss, and also to find the value of the loss. It is shown that for a typical motor, the slip speed should be allowed to increase slightly as required torque increases if minimum loss is to be attained."
"Some working modalities of a three-phase bridge inverter, where the first-harmonic amplitude of the generated voltage varies by means of the output voltage choppering are presented. The variable-frequency inverter is used most often in induction machine speed control. The types of inverter proposed are compared with the most common type having a variable supply voltage, as to the circuitry complexity and the alternating torque generated in the induction machine. The driving circuits of the two choppered inverter are described in the Appendix."
"A method is described for automatic recording of induction motors torque-speed curve M = f(n), both under steady and dynamic states, which is more rapid and accurate than presently known methods. The controlled dynamic state of recording is discussed. Experimental results are given."
"Evolution of the integrated circuit technology into the era of large-scale integration (LSI) has already resulted in a dramatic improvement in device density. Indications are that this improvement will continue for some time to come. This increased device density, with its promise of decreased cost, size, weight, power dissipation and increased reliability, has made many equipment designers eager to design with LSI. Although the literature abounds with articles on the various aspects of LSI, there appears to be a shortage of papers which tie all the tradeoffs inherent in LSI together to provide a useful tool for the designer. This is attempted by looking at LSI through the eyes of an equipment designer who has not previously designed with LSI. A background is provided which will aid the designer in evaluating the many tradeoffs inherent in making a design \"LSI-able.\""
"A new quantity for predicting the subcycle surge current ratings of silicon diodes and thyristors is presented. The quantity I2√t is shown to be much more valid than the more conventional I2t rating in coordinating power semiconductors with fast-acting current-limiting fuses. The requirement of the device to block reverse voltage on the next half-cycle following the surge current is reviewed and shown to be quantitatively significant in the subcycle current capability of power semiconductors."
"Three-step switching by SCR at the line current zero points between different three-phase voltage sources causes significant line current phase shifts during the switching process, even for balanced resistive loads. It also causes a period of no current flow on one of the three-phase lines during the switching process. The phase shifts caused and the duration of the no current flow period is developed for various voltage ratios for balanced resistive loads. Extension of the results to reactive loads is addressed."
"An electrothermal model of the behavior of an ac plasma torch is developed using the concept of an \"equivalent magnetic field\" to account for effects due to the. gas flow field. The thermal characteristics of the model are shown to be in close agreement with empirical results obtained by other workers. The model is of direct and practical importance to the efficient design of electrode configurations for both ac and dc plasma torches and to the development of control strategies for these devices."
"A dynamic lightmeter is described. It has high gain, fast response, and is linear over a range of several decades. It is useful to present instantaneous light values on an oscilloscope or average values on a dc voltmeter. The instrument uses photodiodes in a differential circuit which balances the variation of dark current with temperature. In the high-gain position the overall frequency response is 125 kHz. Its sensitivity can be varied from 2 to 20 mV/fc. The application of the lightmeter is demonstrated on a special-purpose fluorescent ballast, operating from a 25-kHz square-wave source. The meter is used to observe start and decay times and steady-state operation of the lamp. Suggestions are made for calibration of the instrument and its application for closed-loop control."
"New NEMA standards for dc motors for use on rectified power have established new rating and performance criteria in response to the radical change from motor-generator power to rectified power from thyristors. Effective communication and understanding among motor and control designers and users is thereby promoted. Economies in design and manufacture are encouraged."
"The brushless dc motor described consists of a synchronous motor with a rotor position sensor and a three-phase bridge inverter. The commutation in the inverter circuit is performed by the induced voltage of the armature windings. In this situation, since auxiliary commutation devices such as capacitors, inductors, and auxiliary thyristors are not required, the simplest inverter circuit is obtained. However, the commutation ability decreases at low speed and starting difficulty results. A novel starting procedure is described whereby the chopping of the rectifier output voltage is accomplished by control of the delay angle. In order to obtain a rapid interruption of the main circuit current, an auxiliary thyristor antiparalleled to the smoothing reactor is used. Finally, a new method of speed sensing that eliminates the need of a tachogenerator is proposed. Speed stabilization with an accuracy about 5 percent in a speed range of 10:1 is perforned with this new control system."
"The electric demands generated by modem office/commercial buildings invariably require the installation of a multiple number of transformers in close proximity to the building. Many new buildings have power supplied at two locations, one beneath the side-walk and the other up in the building or perhaps on the roof. Any of these installations could provide up to 6000 kVA at 208 V or up to 15 000 kVA at 460 V, at one point of service. Design of major network installations breaks naturally into two parts. First it is necessary to establish the utilization voltage, number of transformers, and number of service points. Only then can we mate the company standards with the customer's building design. The challenge is derived in satisfying company requirements, customer requirements, and municipal regulations within a framework of economics. Underlying the design is also the ability to install, maintain, or replace any component of the supply system without interruption of service. This ability is really the backbone or definition of network design."
"Three-phase motors can be satisfactorily operated with phase converters on single-phase power at full load and with good phase balance if the converter is properly selected and applied. The correct phase converter installation is important, and allowance must be made for the changes in the motor-torque characteristics which occur. Data are shown for the torque characteristics of a motor operated on two typical phase converters compared with three-phase operation and the effect of capacitance on the torque characteristics."

 "The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit System (BART) is the first automatic rapid transit system in the world. It employs the latest state-of-the-art design in electronic automatic controls. This fully automatic rapid transit system will soon enter its first phase of revenue service. The automatic train control system is discussed, beginning with the system requirements and the types of automatic control systems employed. The way in which they function in relation to each other is then shown. Finally, a typical car progressing down the track is described, showing how the vehicle performance is monitored, displayed, and adjusted to meet the system requirements."
"Control systems with transport lag are commonly encountered, and the presence of nonlinearities in such systems makes stability analysis difficult. Parameter plane equations for such systems are formulated and used to map the imaginary axis of the s plane onto the parameter plane. Stability conditions are studied for a system with transport lag and one single-valued nonlinearity and also for a system with transport lag and a hysteretic-type non-linearity. In both cases the existence and characteristics of limit cycles are studied. Application of the method is made to an aircraft pitch control system."
"Technological advances have made possible new and improved electrical systems for rapid transit railroads. Two new circuit elements contribute to this. One of these, the thyristor, or controlled silicon rectifier, is a lineal descendant of the advances in solid-state physics that led to the transistor 21 years ago. Tjhvrstors are still in limited use because of cost, and the costs are gh because of limited use. The same situation existed with respect to the transistor in the earlier years of its availability. As in the case of the transistor, it may be expected that further advances in performance and reductions in cost will occur in the future. The second circuit element is a more recent development. This is the parametric transformer which utilizes variation of inductance instead of flux for energy transfer. The inherent properties of the parametric transformer are of substantial advantage in electric traction since they provide overload protection, filter action, voltage regulation, and a 90-deg phase shift. This last property permits single-phase-polyphase energy conversion in either direction and maintains balance on the polyphase system. This latter property is also advantageous for main-line railroad electrifications. The application of these circuit elements permits single-phase power distribution which in turn can permit use of regenerative braking without causing a problem in reverse energy flow that would add a major item to cost of a dc substation. Control is combined with on-board energy conversion."
"A number of overland conveyor systems have been installed by the cement industry to transport raw materials from the quarry site to the plant site. Somewhat newer to the industry is the concept of making primary crushing plants moveable so that they may be economically fed by large capacity front end loaders directly from the quarry face. Features of two moveable crushing plants and a 3-mi long overland conveyor system installed by Pacific Cement & Aggregates, a Division of the Lone Star Cement Corporation, to crush and transport raw materials for its Santa Cruz Cement Mill located at Davenport, Calif., are discussed."
"The progress and current status of process control computer applications in current plants in the United States are reviewed. The future role of digital computers is projected, including an analysis of the potential of mini-computers. While computers have not been a resounding success in the cement industry, measurable progress has been accomplished. Kiln-cooler control will continue to be hampered by lack of programmable operating parameters and lack of effective sensors. Raw material blending programs will continue to be the most successful area of computer control in cement plants."
"The various mechanical and electrical considerations in the selection of large fan drives are discussed. First there is a review of different types of fans, their special characteristics, and the methods of controlling the air volume. The discussion then proceeds to the two basic types of fan drives: constant-speed direct motor drives and variable-speed coupling drives. The direct drives include the squirrel-cage induction motors, wound-rotor motors, and synchronous motors. Considerable detail is given on heat losses and temperature conditions resulting from the load torque, accelerating torque, and terminal voltage during starting period. Remedial measures are offered to the motor designer and electrical engineer so that a special motor may be designed for a specific electrical system. Stress is placed on the importance of joint efforts by the motor designer, electrical engineer, and mechanical engineer in selecting a drive system with sound engineering and economics."
"Modem textile manufacturing operations depend on sophisticated overhead cleaning equipment for room and machine cleanliness and for assistance in maintaining product quality. It is therefore essential that cleaners operate with minimum failures, and in order to obtain continuous trouble-free operation, cleaning equipment must be reliably designed by the manufacturer and must be reliably maintained by the user."
"Control of emissions from ceramic processes involves legal consideration, technical evaluation, and engineering procedures in the proper sequence. Combined industrial team effort can result in minimizing and solving air pollution problems."
"The basic energy conversion relationship of a linear induction motor is examined by a combination of field and circuit theory. Both homogeneous and composite rails have been considered. From the equations obtained, parametric and tradeoff studies are performed to determine rotor material, rotor thickness, air-gap thickness, stator winding distribution, operating frequency, slip, and synchronous velocity. The results are reduced into equivalent circuit form so that comparisons can be made with rotary induction motors."
"The introduction of power thyristors and rectifiers in dc-dc chopper and ac-dc converter circuits allows the replacement of the traditional dc series motor by the separately excited dc motor. This paper will consider the characteristics and the application of separately excited dc motors operating from either a dc input with a dc chopper using dynamic braking, or from a single-phase ac input with an ac-dc converter using regenerative braking, part I deals with the separately excited dc traction motor itself, while part II deals with its applications."
"The characteristics and the construction of the separately excited dc traction motor has been described in [1]. This type of motor can be used for traction only because of the availability of large power thyristors. In this paper, the type of control circuit required in order to use the separately excited dc motor (dc-dc chopper or ac-dc converters) will be investigated depending on the power supply available (ac or dc)."
"Tbe transmission system substation supply facilities, and protective relaying of the Muskingum Electric Railroad (MERR) are outlined. MERR is a 15-mi coal hauling line representing the first American application of techniques used in the rapidly spreading electrification of railroads in Europe and Asia. The substation and catenary facilities described were developed to provide ideas, examples, and cost samples to show what can be done in electrifying main-line railroad freight service. Catenary for the project is the first 25-kV 60-Hz system installed in the United States. Three types of catenary hangers were used to provide a measure of comparison of different ideas. Installation procedures are described in detail."
"British and Western European experience, design standards, and techniques associated with electrified railway power supply facilities are outlined. Aspects surveyed include utility supply to commercial frequency railway loads, substation design standards, catenary system design and maintenance, telecommunication and radio interference experience and suppression techniques, costs, and construction time. This survey outlines information obtained during 1967 visits with state railway, power system, and manufacturing company engineers in Great Britain, France, Germany, and Sweden. The survey confines itself to experiences and data which are believed applicable to commercial frequency (60-Hz) 25-kV electrification. A substantial part of the European railway catenary system and railway substation technology and experience outlined in the survey appears applicable to future American railway electrifications."
"The management of the combined Chesapeake and Ohio and Baltimore and Ohio Railway Companies recognized soon after coordination of the two roads the need for information system that would help cope with the complex problem of diesel locomotive maintenance. Past practices of detecting chronic problem areas were inadequate in managing the combined diesel fleets of both roads. Through the joint efforts of several departments, specifications for a comprehensive computer system were documented and submitted to the Data Systems Development Group for implementation. Computer programs were designed, programmed, and installed along with an entirely new system of reporting maintenance activity from the field. Through this system, management-now has rapid access to maintenance related data in a variety of forms, both static and flexible, which enables them to take appropriate action on problems before they become chronic."

  "The importance of the transient characteristics of analog regulators used on paper machine drives is shown. The speed regulator was chosen as a model since it is the regulator that is most often used. Two different forms of speed regulators were used to demonstrate the differences between different forms of regulators with comments on these differences. A program from the General Electric time-sharing system was used to simulate the two speed regulators, subjecting the regulators to changes in reference and load to determine their transient performance characteristics. The traces of the regulated values are discussed as to their behavior and possible effects when used as a regulator on a paper machine drive."
"The use of synchronous, drive motors to minimize ac line voltage variations is discussed. The following methods of field control are considered: 1) fixed field excitation, 2) kvar or torque compensation, 3) ac line voltage regulator, and 4) ac line power factor regulator."
"Stalling of an induction-motor, or its failure to accelerate upon start-up, produces both thermal and mechanical stress within the stator and rotor which can be damaging. Whether the stator winding or rotor cage reaches unsafe stress limits first depends upon individual motor design. \"Safe locked time\" is considered the maximum period a motor can be locked on the line without significant loss of motor life. The nature of these stresses imposed on motor components, how they vary with design, and why the nature of acceleration heating differs from that of locked rotor heating is explained. Equally important, the effect of the motor's \"safe time-current characteristic\" (which expresses internal stress limits in terns of line current) on the problem of protective relaying is described. Solution of this problem inust depend upon the system designer's understanding of this characteristic."
"An analysis of harmonics of leakage fields which appear in the vicinity of the motor at its symmetric and nonsymmetric supply is presented. The wave at the frequency (2 -s)·f1, which appears in the second case, may be utilized to protect the motor against single-phase operation."
"Many papers in the decade of the 1960's have covered the basic principles of the dc converter in most aspects of design for 12-, 6-, and 3/6-pulse configurations. The problems discovered in applying these systems are dealt with, and the governing design parameters are identified. Specifically treated are the subjects of safety, isolation, noise immunity, line pollution, and performance. Examples of how hardware design is influenced by these considerations on a regenerative system in the 5-500 hp range are included. The parameter of economics is an important common factor to all application studies, hence this is considered in the conclusions."
"The operating characteristics of generators are discussed with particular emphasis on those used in the generation of power for industry. Methods of operation of generators within safe limits are presented and related to a reactive capability curve."
"Small computers, known popularly as mini-computers, have become available comercially in great profusion during the past few years. The distinguishing characteristics of these machines are low cost, small physical size, work-shop or factory environment capability, computational speed and logic identical to larger and more expensive machines, and their seemingly instant popularity for myriads of new uses. It should also be noted that integrated circuit technology is only the trigger of this boom of small low-cost computers. Low cost stems also from high-volume production for the original equipment manufacturers market, removal of much of the external connector and signal conditioning equipment, borrowing of programming systems and packages from older and more expensive designs of computers, and separate pricing for systems engineering and applications programs. Projects which are to make use of mini-computers must take full cognizance of these as well as the prior list of characteristics."
"The developments in light sources which might be used in textile mills or in their offices or yards are reviewed. Recently, fluorescent lamps have appeared in new shapes and in new color types. One manufacturer adds titanium to the glass to improve light output throughout life; another has a lamp to match incandescent; another features an ultraviolet content. Rated lives of popular types range from 18 000 to 33 000 h. Incandescent lamps are available with life ratings of approximately 3500h. Tungsten--halogen (quartz--iodine) and also new Krypton types have important advantages. Mercury lamps, rated 24 000 h, are available in deluxe white and other colors which can create a very pleasant environment. As with all compact light sources, it is important to space them where the light will reach the depths of machinery. Self-ballasted mercury lamps are described and recommended for use in place of incandescent lamps where additional capital investment is not wanted. Metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps are more efficient than mercury lamps and just as compact. These new types require their own specific ballasts. Each has its distinctive color qualities, some excellent. They give promise of greater reliability and cost saving in the future."
"A discussion of the factors affecting the selection of the best battery type for a particular application and determination of the correct battery capacity is presented. Suggestions are given for the proper installation and care of batteries."
"Special control apparatus has been developed and installed on four 2500-hp 6-motor locomotives to automatically maintain constant very low speeds for continuous loading of hopper cars in unit train service between coal mines and electric generating plants. Speeds can be controlled in the span of 1/8 to 8 mi/h in three ranges (1/8 to 1/2 mi/h, 1/2 to 2 mi/h, and 2 to 8 mi/h) with exact adjustment possible in any of the ranges. Manual operation by an on-board crew directed by radio from the loading location is now used. The special control apparatus presents the possibility of readily controlling train operation directly by radio from the loading location. The same locomotives are used in road service to haul the unit trains between mines and generating plants and may also be used for humping and weighing in-motion operations."
"A time-honored method of judging the quality of track structure is known popularly as \"seat-of-the-pants\" judgment. While this method is both frequently and skillfully practiced, it is not wholly satisfactory in that evaluation is based on subjective response. Consequently, determination of what must be done to improve the quality of the ride is not entirely an objective process. Track measuring cars provide a much clearer indication of what is off-standard in a section of track but give little indication of which variables are the most crucial to the production of a good ride. An approach which is being employed in an attempt to bridge the gap between the track geometry and the quality of ride obtained on a given track section is described. Some preliminary results and conclusions are presented."
"Increased performance, increased passenger comfort, and a high level of automated operation have been achieved in the new design equipment applied to the new PATCO cars. The SCM IV (static-cam-magnetic) control system combined with a higher capacity GE 1255 motor achieves high performance with smooth operation. The automatic train control (ATC) system has achieved safe and consistent train operation with a minimum number of trains."

"The charge retention time to write the time ratio of MNOS memory transistors may be improved by using high field pulses near 107 V/cm in the oxide. Degradation effects including hysteresis loop (Vt vs Vgs) collapse and reduced storage time have been studied at pulse fields in the oxide as high as 1. 6 × 107 V/cm and current densities as great as 30 A/cm2 to determine reliable yulsed high field operating limits beyond the dc limit of 107 V/cm."
  "Degradation of electroluminescence of GaP light-emitting diodes has been Significantly reduced by chemical passivation of the surfaces. Passivation was achieved by producing an amorphous native oxide over the exposed surfaces of completed diode structures. Degradation characteristics of passivated and unpassivated devices are discussed and qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model."
   "A combination of error-correcting circuitry and one-bit/card organization gives increased reliability by masking intermittents and by offering a wide range of servicing strategies. The net result will be higher system availability and lower service costs."
   "The subject of the session as put to the panel and audience by Will Kauffman, was a comparison of the various competing memory technologies with respect to: 1. Reliability; 2. Performance; and 3. Cost These considerations were discussed not only by panel members representing the suppliers of the memory circuits but also by the users, in this case Honeywell Information Systems and IBM Among the subjects discussed were: 1. the accepted failure rate for memories; 2. the number of interconnects for the various technologies and its effect on reliability; 3. the competitive nature of bipolar memories compared to MOS."
  "High volume burn-in systems are available at temperatures over 200°C, and with careful design 300°C systems can be built which are functional and usable as production equipment."
 "Reviewing the foregoing, there are three type of users: one-shot, small-scale, and large-scale. The system that each would use can be summarized as follows: 1. One-Shot: A hand wired system with the wiring coming directly out the door opening. Either a matrix board or a bread-boarded biasing sytem. 2. Small-Scale: A modified door or P.C. card system for the units with the biasing network coming out to a matrix board. 3. Large-scale: A P.C. card system for the devices with a front connector for the P.C. cards. A mother board biasing network externally."
"We have investigated the reliability of various electronic devices and materials in high temperature water and moisture using an autoclave currently used for the reliability tests in several fields. It appears that there are different types of corrosion and instability phenomena among various insulating fillns on silicon. Reliability problems of Silicon Nitride (Si3N4), of Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) and of other films will be discussed."
"Potential propagation over the surface of hermetically sealed or plastic coated semiconductor products may produce failure. A special test structure has been used to characterize the rate of propagation as a function of a number of parameters: humidity, temperature and selected organic coatings. A surface memory effect associated with exposures to humid ambients is discussed. This effect may explain in part the surprisingly wide range of surface instability observed in units hermetically sealed using state-of-the-art packaging techniques. Organic coatings, e.g. silicone varnish, reduce the influence of humidity at temperatures below 90°C. Arrhenius plots obtained in detailed studies at high temperatures allow estimation of stability performance in the 150°C to 200°C range as a function of material composition and curing time."
"Gold-aluminum wire bonds form intermetallic phases with any elevated temperature treatment. Intermetallic formation alone does not cause bond failure. However, certain failure modes--open metallization in the bond area, lifted wire bonds after aging, and heel breaks after thermal cycling--may be related to intermetallic formation. Specific causes of these failure modes are discussed. These form the basis for the recommendations presented as design limits when using gold-aluminum wire bonds in circuits."
"The surface of aluminum metallization on silicon devices can reconstruct with elevated temperature treatments due to the relief of compressive stresses induced by thermal expansion differences between aluminum and silicon. This reconstruction can cause reliability problems because of the development of thin regions in the metal. Also, in multilayer circuits, hillocks can punch through the oxide layer and cause electrical shorts. In this paper the surface reconstruction is categorized into two modes: high temperature--few cycles (device processing) and low temperature--many cycles (device operation). Mechanisms for each of these reconstruction modes are postulated and suggestions for reducing or eliminating this effect are made."
"Anodization of aluminum metallization was studied as a means of improving resistance to electromigration-induced failure. Strips of evaporated aluminum 1 μm thick, 0.6 mil wide and of various lengths were formed on oxidized silicon wafers. Following anodization to a thickness of about 0.2 μm, samples were lifetested at ≥ 150°C with current densities in the 106 A/cm2 range. Lifetimes were improved by factors of 7-14 over those of nonanodized aluminum for test at 220°C with a current density of 8 × 105 A/cm2. Improvement was more pronounced at lower temperatures and for shorter strips. These effects are discussed in terms of mechanisms such as limited vacancy supply, reduced electrotransport rate or reduced density of void-nucleating sites."
"During the past decade the semiconductor industry has used vacuum deposited aluminum films for inter - connection both in bipolar and MOS devices. The major disadvantage of aluminum films, however, has been their early failure due to electromigration (1-4). When subjected to high current densities, aluminum films are found to degrade, form voids and finally become electrically discontinuous thus shortening the life of the devices. During recent years extensive work has been reported on electromigration in aluminum both from the point of view of understanding the phenomenon and with a view to improving the life of the devices using aluminum as the interconnection metallurgy (5-8). An Al + A12O3 alloy has been shown to exhibit superior electromigration resistance (9) and has been postulated that this might be related to higher creep resistance."
"Al-3% Cu stripes are powered in situ in the transmission electron microscope in order to study the effect of copper on the mechanisms of failure due to electro-migration. Consideration is given to the effects of various heat treatments and the depletion of Cu in the damage zone."
"Glass passivation of device surfaces can modify the information which can be obtained by the Scanning Electron Microscope. Integrated circuits containing a variety of defects have been studied before and after passivation to illustrate the deleterious effects of passivation on scanning microscopy analysis. In addition advantages of viewing the glass surface and techniques of glass removal and contrast enhancement are investigated."
"Defect and failure analysis of semiconductor memories is discussed, with emphasis on the use of the SEM in the voltage contrast mode as an analysis tool. The 4100, a 256 bit bipolar memory, was chosen as a vehicle for this study. Voltage contrast micrographs of defects and cell operation in this die demonstrate the usefulness of this technique for quickly locating and analyzing failures in large ordered memory arrays. Voltage contrast micrographs of the 4102, a 16 bit associative memory, are included to demonstrate extension of the technique to multi-level metallization structures."
"Avalanche breakdown and microplasma effects in silicon PN junctions are the direct source of noise generating mechanisms in these devices. Some of the noise sources are fundamentally related to the breakdown mechanism involved. However, in practical Zener diode structures, the mechanisms which contribute to excess noise often result from process induced defects and material imperfections. Breakdown mechanisms have been studied extensively using light emission optical miocroscopy,(1-5) but the technique is limited to shallow structures containing junction depths less than 1μm, particularly when bulk breakdown effects are being studied. These structures are generally free from overlying metal films and are designed to minimize optical absorption effects. Practical Zener diode structures are often more deeply diffused, and contain passivation layers and metal surface films. More recently, utilizing the electron beam induced current mode, the scanning electron microscope has been used to investigate electrical effects such as microplasma phenomena an and avalanche breakdown in PN junctions,(6-8) as well as structural imperfect ions in semiconductor devices. (9-12) This technique, provides the necessary means for the non-destructive investigation of avalanche breakdown sites which give rise to excess electrical noise in Zener diode structures. In the present investigation, a comparison is drawn between Zener diodes which exhibit surface and bulk breakdown mechanisms. Examples are presented which illustrate both typical breakdown noise in these structures, and excess noise resulting from specific process induced defects."
"The essential cause for junction shorts is second breakdown which requires thermal gradients and temperature magnitudes in excess of the intrinsic temperature associated with the materials. From the thermal and current gradient analysis, the following was shown: a. The shorts will follow the lowest resistance path. For a typical microcircuit, this path will occur immediately between the nearest aluminum silicon contacts and in the silicon region adjacent to the Si-SiO2 interface. b. The cause of hot spot formation arises primarily from spreading resistance considerations and not from a localized breakdown mechanism. This is true at least for the pulse widths studied here. c. For pulse widths shorter than 10 useconds, there should be no difference in the power required to cause failure and the device technology, i.e., glassivated, junction isolated or dielectrically isolated devices. This is due to the relatively long thermal time constants resulting from either poor thermal conductivity in the case of the glass or long distances from the dissipating junction in the case of dielectric isolation. d. The junction isolated technology should be relatively uniform in terms of power dissipation. e. Combining the results of gradients and magnitude, the cause for the wide spread in power required for failure has not been specifically identified. The differences in technologies cannot be important for these pulse widths, and the spreading resistance associated with the intrinsic temperature, while not identical, should be relatively uniform from one manufacturer to another. f."
"The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the failure mode caused by thermal deformation and how thermal deformation affects bond integrity. Wedge bonding in small-signal transistors, microcircuits and LSI circuits is the subject of this work. Repeated switching of the devices between high and low power at a rate that allows thermal expansion and contraction in the interconnecting wire causes the wire to flex at the point of reduced cross-sectional area until finally the wire breaks due to metal fatigue. It was observed that the thermal deformation was related to many factors such as device power dissipation, current density in the wire, wire dress and length, thermal time constant and frequency of operation."
"An adequate gold-to-gold weld requires (1) a bonding load large enough to produce good interfacial conformity and (2) a bond interface temperature high enough to effect contaminant dispersal. Although some tradeoff between bonding load and temperature is possible, the range of successful combinations is inherently limited by the fact that one member is a thin film."
"A novel technique for either destructive or non-destructive evaluation of the mechanical integrity of beam lead transistors and integrated circuits has been demonstrated. A Febetron 705 flash electron beam machine was used to generate thermomechanical stress waves which were acoustically coupled to bonded beam lead devices. Computer aided stress wave analysis of the system was used to calculate the stresses generated in the individual beams. This allows prediction of failure modes and levels. Experimental results have demonstrated that failure modes can be related to device or bonding deficiencies, and reveal failures which cannot be easily obtained by other methods of testing."
"The stability of evaporated conductor film/bonding layer combinations of particular interest in tantalum film technology has been investigated in air and corrosive environments at elevated temperatures. The effects of evaporation conditions, conductor/bonding layer combination, temperature of aging and pattern geometry on the rate of degradation were examined. Possible contact degradation mechanisms are discussed."
"Direct cooling of semiconductor components is limited to very low power levels due to the small surface area of the components. Free air convection is limited to about 0.5 watts per square inch while forced air cooling can increase the allowable power levels to 5 watts per square inch. Forced convection with liquid coolants is required for higher power levels. Pressure drop is genrally not a problem due to the low velocities and large duct sizes. Indirect cooling permits more efficient thermal design of heat exchangers. Forced-air cooling can handle heat loads up to 10 watts per square inch. Above this level, liquid is required. Pressure drop is a major factor in forced-air cooling and extended surfaces must be carefully designed. Nucleate boiling presents component access problems. However, it offers the possibility of an order of magnitude increase in power dissipation when compared to forced convection in the same liquid."
"The structural features of the STD hybrid circuit building process are described. `Two features of this structure are unusual: first, the use of evaporated and electroplated metal contacts and, second, the use of a thermoplastic layer to separate two layers of metallization. Since the latter feature is unique to STD at this time, the adhesive properties of the plastic to the other circuit elements and the metal films to the plastic, together with the mechanical strains developed among the structural parts, are examined and discussed in detail. It is shown that the integral parts of the STD circuit adhere well and that the lateral strains, caused by thermal expansion, are insignificant. Also, any vertical strains in the system do not adversely affect contact continuity."
  "This paper discusses an experiment to determine acceleration factors for temperature and humidity life testing based on a single, primary mode of failure. The acceleration parameters to be evaluated are temperature, humidity, voltage and encapsulation. A model is presented that explains the observed results and this is related to defect statistics."

"The multidimensional Kiefer-Wolfowitz stochastic approximation algorithm is proposed for the performance-adaptive self-organizing control of a class of distributed systems. The class of systems considered is that which can be modeled mathematically by the general linear second-order elliptic equation with unknown coefficients and are defined on a fixed and bounded domain Ω. Noisy measurements of the response are assumed available at a finite number of fixed points in Ω. The minimum number of measurement points necessary for recovery of the significant part of the response is determined by application of an n-dimensional extension of the sampling theorem."
"Harmonic analysis of probability distribution functions has long served an important function in the treatment of stochastic systems. The tasks of generating moments and distributions of sums have been effectively executed in the Fourier spectrum. The properties of the Walsh-Hadamard transform of probability functions of discrete random variables is explored. Many analogies can be drawn between Fourier and Walsh analysis. In particular, it is shown that moments can be generated taking the Gibb's derivative of the Walsh spectrum and that products of Walsh spectra yield the distribution of dyadic sums. Stochastic systems with dyadic symmetry would benefit most from the properties of Walsh analysis and the computational advantages it offers. Some applications in the areas of information theory and pattern recognition are demonstrated."
"The notion is exploded that to build a Kalman-Bucy filter, one needs to know the whole structure of the signal generating process. It is shown that the filter is constructible knowing precisely those covariances required to construct a Wiener filter, and no more, and that the filter is independent of the particular models of the processes generating these covariances. Performance of the Kalman-Bucy filter does depend on the models, however. Results are also obtained for the smoothing problem."
"The history of the growth and development of the technology of computer simulation is reflected in an analysis of 2034 sight-read and classified simulation studies of human behavior published before 1971. The limiting goal of the work was an exhaustive bibliography of these simulation studies. The empirical studies referenced are classified into four major model categories for analysis: 1) individuals, 2) individuals who interact, 3) individuals who aggregate, and 4) individuals who aggregate and interact. Each of these studies is also classified into one of eight types, according to the empirical relationship between the model and reality. Additional classifications are employed to describe methodological studies. The analysis includes estimates of the completeness of the bibliography and of the reliability of the classification scheme, as well as the distributions of studies by category and type."
"The purpose of this correspondence is to clarify the decision mechanism of palm reading (palmistry, or chiromancy) from the viewpoints of pattern recognition, learning, and heuristics. Palm reading is studied from the viewpoints of pattern recognition, heuristics, and learning. Two kinds of mapping in palm reading are extracted, these being a tree-decision type and a polynomial type. In contrast to the fairly simple form of mapping, the palm input is relatively complicated but well chosen. The generalization and speciality of palm reading, variations of palm lines, examples of palmistry judgment, and the roles of heuristics and learning in palm reading are mainly discussed."

"Our systems engineering discipline will be an increasingly important factor in making future assessments of the impact of technology on society and in decision-making procedures related to public policies. US Congressman Emilio Daddario, as Chairman of the US House Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development, did much to stimulate the application of these concepts by requesting the US National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering to review and recommend means of assessing the impact of technology on society. In essence their problem was \"to begin the awesomely difficult task of altering present evaluative and decision-making processes so that private and public choices bearing on the ways in which technologies develop will reflect a greater sensitivity to the total systems effects of such choices upon the human environment.\" However, the imperceptible education of our decision makers in these concepts is evident in Max Ways' article, \"Don't We Know Enough to Make Better Public Policies?\" which appeared in the April 1971 issue of Fortune magazine. He noted that decision makers often operate with inadequate information and gross oversimplifications resulting in surprising and unexpected system responses. Those in our ranks who have been affected by the current recession-inflation and the recently surfaced \"anti-technology\" sentiment most likely will agree. Nevertheless, some of our leading educational institutions are recognizing the need for interdisciplinary programs which will marry the concepts of systems engineering methodology with the behavioral and social sciences for training of our future business, union, and political leaders."
"A method for constructing a new type of nonlinear discriminant function is proposed, and the capability is evaluated by computer simulation. As the orthogonal basis for this function, a Φ-function system is used that is obtained by generalizing the finite Walsh functions to the case of many-valued variables. The discriminant function discussed has the following desired features. It can deal with not only binary patterns, but also many-valued ones. The determination of a weighting vector requires neither storage nor iteration for training patterns. A notion of complexity between pattern classes is introduced to make clear the requirement of the present system for the structure of a pattern space. Examples of separation boundaries for 2-component-pattern classes demonstrate that the discriminant function has a high ability of generalization for new input patterns. The result of recognition experiments for artificial patterns indicates that for various values of the number of pattern components, the number of values taken by a component, and the complexity of pattern classes, the proposed system has sufficient rates of classification with a relatively small number of training patterns."
"Linear estimation under a minimum mean-square-error criterion in a quasi-stationary environment is considered. A generalized form of the Widrow-Hoff algorithm is employed for the estimation. Performance is measured by the excess error over the minimum meansquare error. A Gaussian assumption is used to determine this performance and determine simple bounds. The transient solution for the algorithm is investigated and a convergence rate determined. These results are used to optimize the algorithm parameters and bound the performance as a function of the environmental rate of change. The Robbins-Monro algorithm for finding the root of a linear regression function suggests the use of fixed step size stochastic approximation algorithms to solve more general quasi-stationary estimation problems."
"Supervised learning in pattern recognition problems takes place through the use of a set of labeled sample patterns, the labels being provided by a \"teacher.\" In most of the procedures for learning with a teacher, it is commonly assumed that the teacher is perfect, i. e., the labels of the sample patterns are always correct. However, there are many circumstances in which the patterns used for learning are occasionally mislabeled. A procedure for learning with an imperfect teacher who occasionally mislabels some of the learning patterns is developed. The proposed error correction scheme is based on a nonparametric learning scheme. The error correction scheme questions and attempts to correct the labels provided by the imperfect teacher using a threshold in the correction scheme. The use of threshold facilitates control over the amount of correction and provides a simple method for combining the knowledge acquired by the learning scheme with that provided by the teacher. Expressions for the threshold are derived, and the properties of the proposed error correction scheme are discussed. Through computer simulations the performance of the proposed error correction scheme is compared with that of an identical learning scheme without error correction."
"A computer is programmed to detect changes in two aerial photographs of the same region taken at different times. A nonlinear registration technique is used to partition the photographs into cell pairs. Three feature measurements called the two-dimensional correlation coefficient, the average entropy change per picture element, and the high-intensity probability change per picture element are calculated for each cell pair. The pattern recognition system is trained on a set of learning samples and then tested on an independent set of test samples. Experimental error probability curves are presented as a measure of the system effectiveness."
"A television pupillometer and an on-line computer were used to determine the static and dynamic characteristics of the pupillary system in the cat. The characteristics of sphincter and dilator mechanisms were measured with pulse rate modulated electrical stimuli to sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and found to be similar to the light-driven pupillary response characteristic at high frequencies. Linear and nonlinear features of the response characteristics that were identified include retinal logarithmic operator, neural, neuromuscular, and mechanical saturation, high-frequency third-order dynamics of the motor component with a break frequency at 0.8 Hz, nonminimum phase transport delay of about 0.2 s, and response asymmetry to positive and negative steps of stimulation."
"It is well known that head rotation will induce eye movements known as rotational nystagmus, the slow phase of which compensates for head rotation fairly well, and the quick phase of which takes place intermittently in the opposite direction to the preceding slow phase. From both frequency and transient responses, it is confirmed that the slow phase velocity is proportional to the output of the semicircular canal, the main transducer of head rotation. The relationship between the canal output and the quick phase is also discussed. A simple model is proposed in which the quick phase and slow phase are separately generated. In cats under controlled ether anesthesia, it is found that both phases of the rotational nystagmus can be decomposed into primary and secondary components, and a new model of the vestibulo-ocular system is proposed which includes the simultaneous influence of these two components. The model is analyzed to find a condition where the summed effect of primary and secondary components of response constituting the slow phase of rotational ocular nystagmus can be made proportional to the canal output. Many simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the model."
"A two dimensional adaptive model of a human operator in a visual-manual compensatory tracking task is proposed. The model is adaptive to changes in gain and/or form of the plant dynamics on each axis, accommodating plant transfer functions of the form (k/s) or (k/s2). Pattern recognition is used to sense changes in the control system requiring a change in the model operating mode. The form of the model is derived from consideration of the physiological processes evident in a human controller. It contains separate sections dealing with perception of the control system variables, action taken by the central nervous system (CNS) as a result of the sensory inputs, and the conversion of CNS commands into motions of the controller. The model reflects the influence of the dominant type 2 control strategy on the type 1 strategy when tracking is performed with heterogeneous plant axis dynamics. Tests of the gain adaptive algorithm simulating time invariant human operator performance are described, and the test results presented for types 1 and 2 control situations. Results of pattern recognition tests conducted with model-generated data are also presented."
"The multimode oscillator properties of two-dimensional arrays of tunnel diode elements are analyzed in the quasi-harmonic approximation with the assumption of no resonant interaction between the normal modes in order to determine the capacity of an array for information storage. Experimental results for a 4 × 4 array of semiconductor tunnel diodes are discussed, and suggestions for possible future information processing applications are presented."
"In many remote sensing applications millions of measurements can be made from a satellite at one time, and many times the data is of marginal value. In these situations clustering techniques might save much data transmission without loss of information since cluster codes may be transmitted instead of multidimensional data points. Data points within a cluster are highly similar so that interpretation of the cluster code can be meaningfully made on the basis of knowing what sort of data point is typical of those in the cluster. We introduce an iterative clustering technique; the procedure suboptimally minimizes the probability of differences between the binary reconstructions from the cluster codes and the original binary data. The iterative clustering technique was programmed for the GE 635 KANDIDATS (Kansas Digital Image Data System) and tested on two data sets. The first was a multi-image set. Twelve images of the northern part of Yellowstone Park were taken by the Michigan scanner system, and the images were reduced and run with the program. Thirty-thousand data points, each consisting of a binary vector of 25 components, were clustered into four clusters. The percentage difference between the components of the reconstructed binary data and the original binary data was 20 percent. The second data set consisted of measurements of the frequency content of the signals from lightning discharges. One hundred and thirty-four data measurements, each consisting of a binary vector of 32 components, were clustered into four clusters."
    "The content of this very interesting book (Bucharest, Romania: Editura Academiei Republica Socialiste Romania, 1968, 627 pp.) by Paul Dimo is developed in 26 chapters and one appendix. The scope is very broad: the author advances an exhaustive treatment of the nodal analysis of power systems, as considered and developed for the past two decades by the writer and others in research institutes in Romania. This book is of prime interest and value for all engineers-in-practice and engineering college teachers concerned with power-systems operation and/or instruction because of the following reasons. All important aspects are discussed in depth; the particular method of analysis detailed in the text is powerful in manner and facile in use; the content is developed in a systematic lucid fashion; and the implementation of theory in practice is well illuminated by many detailed illustrative numerical examples, which well exemplify the advantages stemming from modern computer oriented techniques. Again, many details of theory, calculation, and practice are advanced which either are not to be found in English-language books in power-systems analysis or are further advanced in the detailed treatments given herein. In consequence this volume certainly should be in all college engineering libraries and on the personal reference shelves of all individuals concerned with modern power systems analysis and operation as teachers or engineers-in-practice."

 "As was anticipated in the January 1971 issue of this Transactions, a new Editor has been named to replace co-Editors John N. Warfield and William R. Ferrell. Beginning with the January 1972 issue, the Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics will be Dr. Andrew P. Sage of Southern Methodist University. By way of introduction, a photograph and biography of Dr. Sage are provided."
"The long-term air quality objectives in the San Francisco Bay Area strive to return the quality of air to 1940 conditions as a best condition but under no circumstances to permit the quality of air to deteriorate below 1970 conditions. Although some improvement in air quality is to be expected over the next decade because of stricter automobile pollution controls, it is expected that the pressure of a rapidly increasing population will tend to overwhelm these otherwise encouraging improvements. Using a simple homogeneous mixing model of the San Francisco air basin as an illustration, a maximum pollution-level constraint on each of several pollutants is derived using the air quality standards of the State of California. In view of the fact that pollution derived from transportation is considered to be the major source function, an analytic model is developed whereby state or federal decision makers can tradeoff various transportation options in order to meet the demand of an ever increasing commuting public while at the same time staying within a given pollution-level constraint. Although the approach presented is developed using derived data assuming a simple homogeneous mixing model and specifically addresses the transportation problem, the tradeoff approach is easily generalized to accepting data derived from more sophisticated models as they become available as well as extended to other sources of pollution suich as power plants and industrial systems."
"Optimization theory and discrete invariant imbedding is used in order to derive computationally efficient sequential algorithms for the maximum likelihood estimation of bias errors in linear discrete recursive filtering with noise corrupted input observations and correlated plant and measurement noise. Error analysis algorithms are derived for adaptive and nonadaptive systems with bias and modeling errors. Examples demonstrate the efficiency of the adaptive estimation algorithms and the error analysis algorithms for estimation with bias uncertainty."
"The problem of partitioning an electronic system into subsystems to be implemented with large-scale integration is considered. The system is composed of interacting functional blocks; the partitioning objective is the minimization of a figure of merit which takes into account the number of different types of subsystems and the number of interconnections between subsystems. An explicit formula is given for the figure of merit, and the partitioning criteria and constraints are illustrated. Based on these criteria, a computer-oriented algorithm is proposed which satisfies the constraints and leads to a quasi-minimum figure of merit."
"Results of the application of a new edge-defining preprocessor to the recognition of handwritten numerals are presented. The decision mechanisms which were simulated are simple and are closely related to maximum likelihood decisions. Results are presented of experiments in which 1000 numeral patterns were used to set up a memory, which was then tested on a further 1000 samples. Success rates approaching 95 percent on completely unselected data have been measured. A convenient rejection procedure is described, and the error reject curves produced are shown. These are so encouraging that the scheme must be regarded as the basis of a practical machine for many real life applications."
"A new algorithm for stochastic approximation has been proposed, along with the assumptions and conditions necessary for convergence. It has been proved by two different methods that the algorithm converges to the sought value in the mean-square sense and with probability one. The rate of convergence of the new algorithm is shown to be better than two existing algorithms under certain conditions. Results of simulation have been given, making a realistic comparison between the three algorithms."
"Criteria for the evaluation of computer systems are traditionally computer science oriented. This exploratory investigation is concerned with evaluations of users' satisfaction with a time-shared computer system. The first part of the investigation is an experiment indicating that the type of programming language, i.e., Basic versus Fortran, is the relevant significant factor in determining the learning rates for the use of the system. The second part of the investigation is devoted to the study of an additive users' utility function. The variables of this function are the waiting time in the queue for a time-shared computer terminal and the users' problem solving time (users' turnaround time at the terminal). It was found that users became rapidly dissatisfied if these times exceeded 10-15 min. A probability density function for the users' turnaround time at the terminal was obtained in the setting of an industrial laboratory. It turned out to be nearly exponential with a mean of about 12 min."
"Two different ways of optimizing a freight railroad system are investigated. In the first, called the \"traditional policy,\" the railroad operating cost is minimized for a given traffic demand. In the second, called the \"user-oriented policy,\" the total cost of transportation is minimized, i.e., the sum of the railroad operating cost and the losses borne by the shippers that are due to the level of service provided. These losses result mainly from the devaluation of the shipments during transit and reflect the value of a certain level of service to the shippers. An example is calculated by means of a computer program developed by the author, and the values of the system variables obtained for each policy are compared. Finally, it is shown that the user-oriented policy would be advantageous to shippers and railroad alike."
"A concept of adaptive aiding for performance improvement in remote handling is described. The concept incorporates an autonomous control subsystem (ACS) that is able to supplement the operator's control function. The behavior of the ACS is established through a process of learning by observing the operator's control function in relation to the environment and manipulator output. The computer-based system establishes a decision-making policy which is based on conditional probability. Initially, the output device is totally controlled by the operator, while the computer system acts as a passive observer. As the operation continues, the computer system gradually assumes the role of active controller, reducing the operator's function to that of an action initiator and inhibitor. A pilot experiment indicates the feasibility of the concept; with a relatively short training period, the ACS was able to assume the bulk of the decision-making load and guide a three-dimensional manipulator satisfactorily through a series of manipulative tasks."
"A complex multidimensional decision hypersurface can be approximated by a set of polynomials in the input signals (properties) which contain information about the hypersurface of interest. The hypersurface is usually described by a number of experimental (vector) points and simple functions of their coordinates. The approach taken in this paper to approximating the decision hypersurface, and hence the input-output relationship of a complex system, is to fit a high-degree multinomial to the input properties using a multilayered perceptronlike network structure. Thresholds are employed at each layer in the network to identify those polynomials which best fit into the desired hypersurface. Only the best combinations of the input properties are allowed to pass to succeeding layers, where more complex combinations are formed. Each element in each layer in the network implements a nonlinear function of two inputs. The coefficients of each element are determined by a regression technique which enables each element to approximate the true outputs with minimum mean-square error. The experimental data base is divided into a training and testing set. The training set is used to obtain the element coefficients, and the testing set is used to determine the utility of a given element in the network and to control overfitting of the experimental data. This latter feature is termed \"decision regularization."
"Current theory considers motor control to be effected over two pathways, one via the alpha motoneurons to the muscle and the other via the gamma motoneurons to the muscle spindles. This mechanism, described as the \"alpha-gamma linkage,\" permits the control of the willed muscle output with the simultaneous maintenance of postural equilibrium by regulation of the muscle's length sensors. The stretch reflex thus remains a functional component of voluntary motor activity. We describe an additional mechanism which can play a role in this control task. This mechanism is control of the gain of the stretch reflex loop. Experimental evidence for the existence of this mechanism is given, and its significance discussed. Not only are the control system dynamics strongly affected, but an additional feature is that the computations required of the central nervous system are simplified."
   "Noton's interesting but rather informally presented theory fails to accommodate all pertinent phenomena, and as yet is not supported by conclusive evidence."
   "A workshop on pattern recognition was held the first day (October 14) of the 1970 Systems Science and Cybernetics Conference, Pittsburg, PA, USA. There were five discussion leaders who conducted serial sessions. Each session included invited key participants who had prepared summaries of their technical positions on a topic covered in that session. The summaries for each session were made available to the audience at the beginning of each session. The discussion leaders conducted their sessions in such a way that the audience could interact, interjecting their viewpoints. Approximately 85 people were present initially, and about 40 people remained until the workshop ended. The Workshop Chairman was L.N. Kanal, Chairman of the Pattern Recognition Committee, and the Workshop Organizer was E.A. Patrick. Other workshops that have been held include the IEEE Workshop on Pattern Recognition, Delft, The Netherlands, August 1968, and the International Conference on Frontiers of Pattern Recognition, Hawaii, January 1971. The next workshop planned by the Pattern Recognition Committee will be all day Wednesday, October 27, 1971, the second day of the 1971 Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Conference, the Joint Conference on Major Systems with the Operations Research Society of America, Disneyland Hotel, Anaheim, CA, USA. The summaries for the 1970 conference held in Pittsburgh, written by the key participants and grouped according to session, are presented."

"Educational opportunity is demanded by almost every segment of today's technology-oriented society. However, concurrent with enrollment increases at institutions of higher education, state fiscal authorities are becoming increasingly critical in the allocation of educational funds and the way in which such funds are spent. Colorado State University is solving this two-sided problem of economically utilizing the educational resources of the State while meeting the academic needs of a wider segment of the population by means of two innovative programs whose medium of communication is videotape. Industrial personnel in Colorado can now study graduate-level courses leading to higher degrees in a majority of the engineering disciplines via Project SURGE, without leaving their work location; college students enrolled in two-year pre-engineering programs throughout the State can now transfer directly to four-year university degree programs with all their key prerequisite courses completed via Project CO-TIE (Cooperation via Televised Instruction in Education). Although the state of Colorado is somewhat unique in the geographical constraints it imposes on the use of educational television, the experiences gained in Projects SURGE and CO-TIE are directly applicable to the solution of similar problems facing educators throughout the United States."
"Freshmen students of equal ability were paired. One member of each pair enrolled in freshman English. In a test three months after completion of the course both members of each pair were asked to write a theme and evaluate some errors in sentence structure. The group not having had freshman English made fewer errors on the test than those who had completed the course. In a statistical analysis of the data the difference was not significant at normally accepted probability levels. A somewhat similar study with similar results was carried out with students in a technical writing course. An extensive review of the literature was made. The results reported by other investigators were very similar to the results of this study. It was concluded that college composition courses do not improve the writing behavior of students."
"The objective of this project is to evaluate Keller's Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) in an appropriate course in engineering. This method is characterized by demanding unit perfection, being self-paced, using lectures only as motivational devices, and using proctors for most of the routine contact with students. In a rapidly advancing technology it is important to teach engineering students to be able to continue learning after graduation. The PSI method should be able to take advantage of the tight structure and definite course objectives of most engineering courses to develop self-learning ability in the students. This project takes the material in a senior level course in nuclear engineering and divides it into appropriate study units, develops a hierarchy between units, and creates the study questions and test material required by the PSI method. An evaluation of this technique in engineering is made using standard forms in existence in the Department of Educational Psychology and in the College of Engineering, as well as a comparison between the self-paced students and students who have taken the same course by the standard lecture method."
"As an experiment in student-directed group research activity in an area of social relevance, a small interdisciplinary group of undergraduates engaged in a ten-week research seminar concerned with technical aids to the blind. The instructor played only a minimal role. Several projects were undertaken and many have been pursued, at the students' initiative, beyond the end of the seminar. Although the extreme freedom experienced by the students led to some frustrations, most enrollees felt the experience to have been very valuable."
"This paper deals with a hyperbolic account of how scientific disciplines came into being and a means for dealing with the establishment of new academic programs. In the past, legitimate academic subject areas have been created by fission and fusion. Fission results when a single field of knowledge is fractionated into two or more fields that are formalized as new departments in colleges and universities. Fusion results from the combining of two separate fields into a single academic department. New departments created by fusion should offer degree programs at the graduate level by establishing requirements that fit the programs rather than following traditional departmental boundaries. Departments should be considered more as administrative necessities and less as a means of defining or protecting knowledge boundaries."
"Does learning require repetition? What factors affect recall? How important is diagnostic testing? A generation ago learning psychologists based answers to such questions on Thorndikean formulations. In this paper a leading contemporary educational psychologist discusses the new theories and explains some of the provocative experiments on which they are based."
"The departmental library is discussed within the context of the university as a whole. The structure of the academic library is related to the structure of the parent institution. Departmental libraries are examined as to their performance for students and faculty. Detailed crnticisms of specific shortcomings are presented, illustrated from the author's experiences. The implications of departmental libraries for the professional librarian are argued. An \"ideal\" central library is described. A short list of suggested readings is appended."
"IA simple balanced RC bridge is used to illustrate the concepts of controllability and observability of a timeinvariant system. The student can use elementary circuit techniques on this example to understand the concepts of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, modes, controllability, and observability."

"Programmed instruction is developed in a manner analogous to an engineering design problem, hence engineers can apply many of their skills to the design of such instructional materials. Like the engineer, the programmer first sets up his objectives and specifications before beginning to lay out his detailed design. The design work is followed by prototype testing and revision and then by field testing before production. The power of the program is based on the student's active response to a carefully designed sequence of elements. The combination of detailed specification of requirements, active response, and objective testing will produce reliable results."
"There are many signs that engineers can and will make contributions to the understanding of social systems and to social problem solving. The peculiarities associated with social systems research, especially as it takes place in an educational setting, are examined in detail. There has been a traditional strong bond between engineering education and research, and it is essential to examine this new area to determine those factors which will affect the evolution of meaningful projects and curricula. Social systems research has many characteristics which differentiate it from other well known engineering research areas. The role of the academic participants in this research will be different from the past. The employment opportunities for engineers educated to do social problem solving will open new avenues of professional activity. A variety of observations and proposals are made to help the evolution of this new engineering direction proceed quickly and smoothly."
 "A program entitled \"Industrial Affiliation Program in Physical Electronics\" has been in operation since January 1968 and is designed to widen the technical channels between the technical staff in companies and the research faculty members in the university. The program involves about 20 faculty members of the College of Engineering of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and ten companies. The faculty members represent six laboratories in the Department of Electrical Engineering and four different research groups in the Coordinated Science Laboratory, a multidisciplinary research organization. All are doing independent research related to physical electronics. The participating companies are geographically dispersed and all have research groups in similar technical areas. The program has resulted in the following for the university: 1) funds, 2) research contracts, 3) fellowships, and 4) equipment and material for an undergraduate laboratory. Industry has received 1) consulting, 2) prepublications and reports, 3) continuing education, 4) student recruitment, and 5) exchange of personnel. As a result of the success of this program over a period of less than three years, the research activities of both industry and the university are more compatible and, therefore healthier."
"This paper describes a prepatch panel for a desktopsize analog computer which prewires the computer to simulate a large class of two-dimensional quasi-linear differential systems. Examples are given to show that once such a system is written in the proper mathematical form, its computer simulating can be accomplished directly from the panel without having to first draw the usual analog wiring diagram."
"Widespread developments in lasers and coherent optical electronics during the past decade make this an important and growing area of electronic technology. A course in lasers and laser electronics for undergraduate or first-year graduate engineers is described. The course adopts an electronic engineering approach to the subject, makes extensive use of simple class demonstrations, and requires no quantum-mechanical background or prerequisites outside the usual undergraduate engineering curriculum."
"The program in electric power engineering at Iowa State University provides opportunity for study at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Such a program depends strongly upon the presence of a faculty who are competent and interested in power. It has been possible to attract such a faculty at Iowa State because of the University's excellent policy of providing both teaching and research opportunities. This makes it easier to find research support and to provide increased opportunity for graduate study. The graduate program is also aided by a unique undergraduate program in power which consistently attracts a large fraction of each class."
  "The compensation theorem relates the change in current when an impedance is added in a loop to the current that existed originally. It is shown that the voltage scattering variables may be defined in terms of the current change and the original current. The compensation theorem may then be used to determine the scattering matrix."
"A new simplified and economical technique, suitable for instructional use, to obtain experimental C(V) plots for MOS structures is described. Comparison of theoretical and experimental C(V) characteristics allows determining the number of excess charges in the thermally grown oxide, serving as an economical quality gauge for the oxide-growing process."

 "An electronic circuit design laboratory for juniors emphasizes creativity and innovation in solving practical problems. Students in pairs do the design, construction, and measurement on each project. Students are free to select the method(s) of attack and the materials and instruments they need. The working circuit is demonstrated and the design is defended in an oral examination once a week. Laboratory scheduling and the duties of each member of the laboratory staff are discussed. The costs in man hours and materials of running the laboratory are broken down and the use of materials donated by industrial gift programs is pointed out. The final project of the semester, lasting three weeks, simulates a typical industrial engineering atmosphere. The students compete to see who can design the lowest cost circuit that meets the specifications. Costs for materials, labor, patent applications, and royalties are totaled in the comparison. The problem selected is one with many solutions and many clever ideas result from this competition."
"A senior electronics laboratory at Michigan Technological University has operated for more than a year with 100 students each term working individually on an open laboratory basis. The objectives of the laboratory are to teach the theory and practice of experimentation and supplement engineering theory presented in the classroom. Students schedule their laboratory time in two-hour blocks and perform experiments alone without direct supervision. This laboratory has increased development of experimental skills for all students compared with traditional group operation. The laboratory has functioned on a small budget with no new equipment in the first year and no increase in instructor time. This mode of operation is presently being extended to selected analog, digital, and electromagnetic laboratories."
"An experiment was conducted to study the effects of introducing several variations of examination and scheduling procedures in two electrical engineering laboratory courses at Purdue University. In both courses sections were divided into two types: one with oral examinations, the other without. Schedule variations in Course A consisted of conventional scheduling and a one-time tutorial arrangement. Three scheduling methods, providing various degrees of flexibility on the part of the student, were tried in Course B. Each course provided the basis for a crossed factorial design, which was analyzed using analysis of variance techniques. Operational descriptions of the examination and scheduling factors are given along with a discussion of any special administrative or logistical steps necessary to implement the various teaching techniques. The instructional combinations were evaluated by means of a common final examination and a questionnaire designed to measure differences in attitude, work loads, perception of student-instructor relations, etc. Analysis of variance techniques were used to evaluate the relative contribution of each factor or combination of factors. Results of administering the final exams and questionnaire are presented and implications of the study are discussed."
"The pedagogical basis for one of the M.I.T. project laboratories, \"Audio Frequency Communications,\" where students work on independent projects in electronic signal processing, is presented along with a discussion of its raison d'être. The format is unstructured, with the projects being used as a basis for the topic discussions. Appendixes list the project suggestions and the range of of topics discussed."
"This paper describes a unique electrical engineering laboratory course. This laboratory is an example of industry-university cooperation in engineering education. The organization and operation of the course is outlined and explained. The educational benefits derived from such cooperation between industry and the university are briefly detailed. These benefits are extended to the students, the university, the faculty, and the participating industry. This paper provides the framework and challenge to industry from which other laboratory experiences can be conceived and developed."
"Simple lenses can be used to produce the Fourier transform of a spatial signal. Two optical experiments related to Fourier analysis are described. The first experiment measures the power spectrum of a spatial signal and displays the result directly on an oscilloscope. The second experiment measures both the convolution and the correlation of two spatial signals and again displays the result on an oscilloscope. The use of the experiments in undergraduate engineering laboratories at Oakland University is described."
"The high cost of establishing and maintaining an integrated circuit fabrication facility is prohibitive for many electrical engineering programs. As discussed in this paper, an integrated circuit laboratory experience can be realized for a total investment of less than $ 5000. The laboratory is based upon the monolithic integrated circuit breadboards commercially available, and requires a lead bonder for interconnecting elements on the breadboard chips. Characteristics and limitations of monolithic structures are readily studied in this laboratory, and student-generated custom-designed circuits are easily assembled."
"The feasibility of including integrated circuit fabrication in an electrical engineering curriculum is discussed. Using specific examples from an operational program, it is shown that fabrication experience can be effectively introduced in the first course in a laboratory sequence. Both the technical and financial aspects of instituting such a program are considered. It is found that by taking an adaptive approach a school can obtain the necessary technology and equipment at a very reasonable expense."
"The understanding of solid-state electronic materials is greatly improved by a laboratory, particularly at the undergraduate level where a complete theoretical treatment of the subject is not possible. In the laboratory described in this paper, students work on term projects dealing with the measurement of fundamental electrical and optical characteristics of semiconductors and with the fabrication of simple semiconductor devices. The students are given a great deal of freedom in choosing and developing their own techniques and instrumentation."
"This paper contains a summary of parts of the report by COSINE Task Force VI on Digital Systems Laboratories. The types of equipment available either commercially or locally built are described and compared to aid the individual who is starting or expanding a digital lab in the selection process. The kinds of equipment discussed are broken into three major areas: logic networks, modular components, and minicomputers. The order of acquisition of these equipments is particularly stressed."
"Over the past five years a digital subsystem laboratory has been developed at Purdue University. The laboratory is operated in two parts: a closed shop portion with specialized instruction in digital subsystems and an open shop portion with a large repertoire of experiments from which the students may select those of particular interest. This paper describes the development of this laboratory as well as its operation. A detailed list of the various experiments which have been successfully used in both the open and closed shop portions is included. A short discussion of the accompanying digital design course material is also presented."
"Programmed instruction is being used to teach use of the oscilloscope in the first electrical engineering laboratory course at the University of Texas. A programmed text was developed that breaks down the process of operating a scope into a series of logical steps starting with deflection of the electron beam and continuing through proper use of the triggering controls to measure the phase difference between two waveforms. Students take from 8 to 45 hours to complete the program, which requires both preparation and laboratory work. Results from practical examinations and observation of student performance in later courses indicate that students learn to use the oscilloscope more effectively from the program than from conventional laboratory instruction. Use of programmed instruction in the first course assures that every student learns to use the oscilloscope and provides for a wide range of individual abilities."
"A brief description of the construction of an inexpensive integrated circuit mask fabrication facility is presented along with comments on operating procedures that have been found useful."
"A switching circuits laboratory has been developed during the past year within the Computer Science Division at the University of Utah. This laboratory is used for a project-oriented undergraduate course and as a facility for independent study and theses. The laboratory equipment was all designed and built at the university and is inexpensive, reliable, and relatively easy to duplicate."

  "The relationship between computers and electrical engineering is far different from what it is in other fields because the electrical engineer is not just a user of computers-more importantly, he is their builder and designer. Thus, electrical engineering has a special responsibility to train its students in both the basic and applied aspects of computer science and engineering. To meet this responsibility, electrical engineering curricula must undergo substantive changes. In particular, the emphasis in basic courses should shift from the continuous to the discrete, from analysis to algebra, from circuit theory to digital systems and from signal analysis to formal languages. On the applied side, the student should be provided with courses in data structures, computation structures, computer organization, and information organization and retrieval. An argument is made in favor of a \"free curriculum\" in which a student is gi\" ven a very large measure of freedom in shaping his program of study."
"The computer has been viewed primarily as a symbol-manipulating machine. Yet, it is capable of generating and displaying visual images showing abstract form, shape, and dynamic process. Recent psychological research on perception suggests that pictures and symbols play important but very different roles in creative thought. By providing enactive and iconic modes of communication between man and machine, the computer can serve as a prosthetic device to assist man in giving public expression to his private mental images. By so doing, it may be possible to equalize in some measure the imbalance between man's great endowment for perceiving and very limited capability for producing visual images. By so doing, we may enhance the human use of the computer as an intellectual companion rather than as an economic competitor."
   "Innovation in computer utilization for educational purposes requires both modem computing hardware and insight to determine how to best apply this hardware within a discipline. Experiments using digital and hybrid computers at both the elementary and advanced levels are described, illustrating ways in which the student can be exposed to modern computing algorithms and design aids within the restrictions of an undergraduate curriculum."
"This paper discusses an experimental course developed at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, during the last five years. Taught during the second year, the course introduces the student to electrical networks, continuous systems, combinational (logic) networks, finite-state machines, and some numerical methods. The material is taught through the common vehicle of the state model, and strives to give the student the necessary fundamentals for coping with the foreseeable future trends in electrical engineering."
"A tutorial paper on computer animation is presented that answers the following questions. 1) What is computer animation and how did it begin? 2) Who is active in the area? 3) What is the present state of the art? 4) How is computer animation accomplished in a batch-processing environment? 5) What is the role of interactive graphics? 6) What are some of the special techniques that are being developed? 7) How does one get started? In addition, extensive bibliographies on computer animation publications and films are included."
"Online computer systems for education have developed from a number of independent efforts with the common goal of using the computer as an aid in the educational process. These efforts can be generally separated into two classes, depending upon whether the primary purpose was instruction about computers or instruction of other subjects with the aid of computers. Such systems can be grouped into those that provide essentially programmed learning in a classical (CAI) tutorial fashion, those that attempt more free-form conversational interaction, and those where the computer serves in an adjunct role as simply another tool for the analysis of a given problem. Typically, an on-line system involves the use of a central computing facility that supports on-line satellite terminals as well as other services. Much of the early work was done with only teletype terminals and these are still used in many installations. However, the typewriter has limited graphics capability, so the use of visual display media has come into widespread use. A very recent trend in the sophistication of the terminal has been the use of a minicomputer as a component in the terminal. Concurrent with this development has been the utilization of minicomputers in a dedicated mode for a variety of educational purposes. It is clear that use of such systems to support education will grow rapidly in the future and that considerable commonality in the development of such systems will exist."
"In this paper we present the results of a senior-level design project in which a minicomputer, the UHC-1, is developed. We also discuss the underlying philosophy of what constitutes valid design experiences on the undergraduate level."
"The results of an experiment to test suitability of development of large-scale computer programs as an electrical engineering student project are presented. Fasp, a user-oriented application program for analysis of signal flow graphs, was developed by a team consisting of a senior, two sophomores, and two freshmen. The senior was able to do most of the program design and coordination. The program, consisting of about 3500 ANSI Fortran statements, was developed in one semester and was tested over the summer on a CDC 1604, a Univac 1108, and an IBM 360/50. The results show that such a software project can be used to extend the benefits of project-oriented courses to an earlier point in the engineering curriculum."

 "\"The Fatal Abstract\" is a dramatic exhibit of the superiority of the informative abstract or summary to the conventional descriptive or table of contents variety. It shows how the more effective abstract justifies the far greater effort it requires, and in a digression devoted to the preparation of abstracts for symposia, shows that it is both unethical and self-defeating to offer the same abstract to several meetings at once. A secondary \"message\" of this drama, which takes place in a biophysics laboratory responsible for the logistic support of a spacecraft that has landed on Venus, is that the effective communication of the essence of a complex body of information depends on careful selection of the level of generalization and the rigorous elimination of redundancy. The play requires four actors but no properties or scenery, and should be read aloud rather than memorized. However, it is designed to be followed by an open panel discussion in which the actors become the panelists, and the actors must therefore be experienced writers or editors if they are to deal effectively with questions raised by the audience."
"As part of a preliminary investigation of computer-aided translation under time-shared data processing, various techniques of computerized dictionary lookup and text file management have been explored under the time-sharing system TSS/360. Computer-aided translation (CAT) is a storage and retrieval operation carried out on line with a computer during the time in which a translation is produced. A system of dictionary access and updating routines, text-processing facilities, and on-line utilities is designed to telescope the delay between the initiation of a translation and its finished printout. The system does not attempt to simulate the human translator by producing an autonomous translation via programmed algorithms; rather, it serves as an extension of the capabilities of the user, who is able to call on the resources of the computer as needed in the process of translation and get an immediate response. Under the system described, users communicate over ordinary telephone lines with the computer by means of remote terminals. In employing the system, the user can switch back and forth as many times as required among human translation, direct dictionary lookup, editing, printing, and system interrogation, and thereby achieve rapid iteration toward the desired goal, i.e., a finished translation."
"The following is a study to determine the feasibility of preparing a symbolic integration maintenance manual (SIMM) for complex new electronic systems. The soundness of the SIMM concept as a vehicle for improving system effectiveness is critically analyzed on the basis of studies conducted by the military, and by comparing SIMM with the traditional technical order from the point of view of costs, speed of preparation, and the extent to which preparation time is reduced. Some attention is also given to a critical evaluation of SIMM specification MIL-M-24100A and hardware design disclosure MIL-HDBK 226."

 "There is a widespread practice in English departments of \"conscripting\" technical writing instructors who lack the interests and technical backgrounds called for by the teaching requirements. This often results in a course content differing widely from the catalog description. Where the English department displays a notable lack of interest in technical writing, a course devoted to discourse on technical or scientific subjects might be much more valuable. Tests administered to university students majoring in science or engineering show that they retain the ability to write coherent and forceful English prose even though they receive no further training in this skill after their freshman year. However, they may find in their postgraduate experience that they needed more instruction in writing done under pressure-typical of technical writing. A properly structured senior course, including the problems in technical report organization, format, and precision of expression could save an author time and result in more efficient transfer of information in his future technical writing."
"A new generation of typesetting devices has gained wide acceptance in the graphic arts industry. These machines not only lend themselves to operation by a computer, they demand it; their speed and flexibility can be exploited in no other way. One such machine is the VideoComp®; a programming system that supports it is called PAGE-1. This paper is a tutorial introduction to the PAGE-1 language through which the user specifies his typographic format requirements to the system. The concluding section of the paper presents an application of the language to a sample typesetting problem."
"Hyphenation programs used in computerized typesetting employ varied techniques-often in combination-to determine where to break the last word on a line. Usually, a dictionary lookup procedure is combined with a \"logical hyphenation program\" which bases its decisions on the recognition of certain characters, strings of characters, or patterns of vowels and consonants. The described program is such a logical routine. It is based on the word division rules of Webster's New International Dictionary and recognizes prefixes, suffixes, and other letter combinations which require special processing, including strings which are likely to belong to accented syllables. Otherwise, normal processing consists of finding the character pair corresponding to the greatest interruption of spoken sound, using a prestored table which contains a \"break value\" for each possible pair of characters. The program was coded for the RCA Spectra 70/45. Program performance was evaluated by simulation of line justification in a narrow column measure."

"Courses in technical writing available to management for updating the writing skills of practicing scientists and engineers range from one-day in-house lectures to one-year college courses, including a variety of short courses. This paper presents their comparative advantages and disadvantages as seen by the author, who has taught most of them at one time or another during the past 20 years. High in providing motivation, the one-day lecture reaches the greatest number of students at one time, but quickly loses its effectiveness if students do not practice. The long courses allow time for writing and rewriting, but classes must be smaller and attendance is a problem. The eight-week short course is a good compromise and there is a three-day cram course that has been well received. In every class the students must be carefully screened, while the instructors can be either in-house editors or imported specialists. From among the many variations, management can select the best course to suit its specific needs and its available funds."
"Innovations in the field of point-to-point communications could have far-reaching economic and ecological consequences, such as replacing, for some, the journey to work.

  "I hope that this outline of the radioactivity problems associated with nuclear power has answered some of your questions, and has explained some of the current controversy in this field. There is no real need for either radioactive pollution of the environment or for blackouts, so far as nuclear power is concerned. It is clear that by known technology, and for a very reasonable cost, we can essentially eliminate the radioactive pollution without impeding the development of the industry in any way. It is suggested, then, that we heed the admonition of all responsible authorities to minimize radiation exposure, and go about the business of doing what we know how to do as engineers. If we do that, the arguments as to how much radioactivity is \"safe,\" and how many people may be harmed, will become truly academic, as there won't be enough radiation exposure to measure."
"The present severe shortage of electric power plants cannot be ignored. Some alternatives are discussed and the merits of building nuclear plants presented. The environmental effects of nuclear and fossil fuel plants are compared. It is argued that the small but finite risk of living near a nuclear plant is preferable to the certain pollution of a coal-fueled power station."
"Per capita energy requirements for the world are projected for 2000 AD and 2020 AD, The release of this energy will cause the surface temperature of the earth to rise. This places a limit on world population in terms of standard of living and increase in surface temperature."
 "A real-time system for nerve spike recognition and separation has been developed. The system is based on the techniques, commonly used in nuclear instrumentation, which have been adapted here for biological signal measuring and processing. Techniques used are signal shaping and optimum noise filtering; pulse peak stretching; peak sampling; pulse shape discrimination and multichannel pulse height analysis. Spectra for nerve pulse heights of the cockroach are shown, for the case of spontaneous activity as well as for evoked activity (e. g. for a living object exposed to radiation wind or light). Similarities and contrasts between nuclear and biomedical signal analysis are discussed."
"The accurate identification of eye tumors continues to be a difficult medical diagnostic problem. The several non-nuclear clinical diagnostic techniques that have been used, such as direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, transillumination, fluorescein angiograph, ultrasonography and direct analysis of the subretinal fluid, have all resulted in a high percentage of misdiagnoses. This has resulted in eyes being enucleated that did not contain malignant melanomas, but more tragically, eyes with malignant tumors were not enucleated, resulting in the death of the patient due to the metastatic spread of the tumor. At the present state of development, the 32p uptake test offers the best diagnostic method. For tumors of the uveal tract both G. M. and semiconductor detectors can be used. Detectors more sensitive to lower energy betas are needed to diagnose deeper lying tumors and to study the possible correlation between percent 32p uptake and the particular cell type of the tumor."
"The 32P eye tumor identification test is being reevaluated using semiconductor detectors. Diagnostic tests for both anterior and posterior lesions of the uveal tract are being performed on patients, and a comparison is being made between the conventional G. M. eye tumor counter and the silicon lithium drifted, Si(Li), silicon surface barrier and silicon avalanche beta detectors. Results from 31 tests performed to date indicate that among the detectors tested, the Si(Li) posterior detector gives the most consistent, sensitive and reliable results. For tumors of the uveal tract a beta energy threshold as determined by the detector window thickness and electronic noise can be as high as several hundred keV. Surface barrier detectors placed in suitable probes can therefore also be used for these lesions. For more deeply imbedded tissue tumors, such as lesions of the choroid, iris or retina, the silicon avalanche detector shows considerable promise because of its greater sensitivity for lower energy betas."
  "Spark chambers with digitized readouts offer distinct advantages in spatial resolution and coverage over other gamma-ray imaging devices. While these chambers usually require external logic signals for triggering, in this paper we describe a method that provides self-triggering spark chambers. We also describe initial tests of a 45 × 45 cm spark chamber with 60Co and 198Au samples."
"Iron-55 can be accurately determined directly in blood or other liquid samples by placing the sample in a long length of fine-bore thin-walled polyethylene tubing which is located between two large-area, low background proportional counters. This method reduces the required analysis time from days to minutes with only a slight reduction in sensitivity."
"For the measurement of total-body calcium, sodium, chlorine, nitrogen and phosphorus by in-vivo neutron activation analysis, there are two basic requirements. First, it is necessary to achieve a uniform neutron flux through the human subject. It is also necessary to quantitatively measure the induced radionuclides in the body. The Brookhaven 54-detector whole-body counter with its on-line computer satisfies this latte requirement by providing an absolute measure of the induced activity in the subject, independent of its location in the body and the size of the body itself. The application of this whole-body counter in the in-vivo measurement of total body calcium, sodium, chlorine, nitrogen and phosphorus is described."
"A study of an unusually compact and well defined river system containing many environmental factors leading to water pollution has been carried out by neutron activation analysis. Detailed baseline measurements of the levels of sodium, chlorine, magnesium, manganese, calcium, strontium, and aluminum were made and tests made above and below major effluent sources."
"In the elastic scattering of a moving ion by a stationary target nucleus, the maximum scattering angle in the laboratory reference frame is equal to, or less than, 90° if the mass of the scattering nucleus is equal to, or less than, that of the incident ion. Thus, beams of oxygen ions incident upon a biological sample composed of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen will not scatter into detector placed at an angle greater than 908 . Any element heavier than oxygen scatters incident oxygen ions into such a detector. This particular choice of incident ion and detector position discriminates against the bulk of the material in a biological sample and allows detection of only the minor constituents . Accelerated beams of 20- to 30-MeV oxygen ions from the Kansas State University tandem Van de Graaff accelerator have been used in this technique. Initial studies have centered upon determining the contaminations that are present in flour. Thick targets are used, so that the beam is stopped entirely within the sample. The spectrum consists of a continuous distribution of energies up to a maximum energy corresponding to ions scattering from the surface of the sample. This maximum energy determines the mass of the contaminant nuclei, while the number of scattered particles is proportional to the quantity of contaminant nuclei."
"The feasibility of using low energy (15-25 MeV) α-particle scattering for detecting traces of heavy elements in a bulk of light elements as, for example, in biological and environmental matter is explored. These measurements can provide information on all the elements in the sample simultaneously. Heavy elements require good energy resolution (~10 keV) for definite identification while light elements can be identified even with very poor energy resolution (~100 keV). Results of some measurements on a fish sample are presented. Similarly sub-Coulomb (p,α) reactions are explored for measuring traces of very light elements in a bulk of heavy elements. Suitable choice of bombarding energy almost completely suppresses the contribution from the heavy element. Results of a measurement in a very pure Zr sample are presented."
"The paper reviews recent developments of monolithic linear integrated circuits. Attention is given to operational amplifiers, voltage comparators and voltage regulators. Other developments including the monolithic four-quadrant analog multiplier and the phase-locked loop are also described."
"Fast electronic modules for nuclear physics experiments are under design at Dubna. In this paper the following modules are described: a pulse shaper with a fixed discriminating level, a pulse shaper using the constant fraction of pulse height technique, two-fold coincidence unit. The modules for discriminating and timing signals contain the fan-out standard circuit with both nanosecond logic and subnanosecond outputs. The compensation of temperature variations of the discriminating level and the compensation of time drift of subnanosecond output pulses has been designed and introduced in modules. In our pulse shlapers after the temperature compensation was introduced, the long time stability and time drift of subnanosecond logic output pulses were measured and found within ± 10 ps/ 24 hours. The attempts are made to build a coincidence-anticoincidence logic for nuclear physics experi-FWHM.ments with the time resolution of 0.5 ns at"
"A fast timing circuit suitable for zero-crossing and constant fraction pulse-height trigger constructed with matched pairs of emitter coupled integrated circuits and a tunnel diode is described, the former for the negative leading pulse recognition and the latter for the true zero-crossing detection. Current pedestal is generated internally to assure true zero-crossing detection without external bias signals. Zero-level bias compensation was found to be necessary for slow zero-cross detection and a method suitable for the purpose is given together with a brief discussion."
"Methods of applying pulsed-charge feedback to the charge-sensitive preamplifiers used with semiconductor detectors are discussed. All have in commn the accumulation of radiation-induced charge pulses on a feedback capacitor to produce a voltage ramp at the output of the feedback stage, which is reset at an appropriate point by pulsing a charge feedback path. Advantages of pulsed feedback over the conventional dc feedback techniques are discussed, together with the precautions required to reduce the effect of the large reset pulse on the later electronics. The application of pulsed-light feedback to low energy X-ray spectrometers is discussed and results are presented. We also discuss sane aspects of this system that tend to limit its high-rate performance. A brief account of the use of a transistor current-switch feedback system to reduce overload problems in high-energy γ-ray spectrometers is also given."
"X rays emitted in the decay of transuranic elements (particularly plutonium) are often used for radiochemical and health physics measurements of these materials. For any given source the X ray to alpha ratio (X/α) varies with isotopic composition (variations of a factor of seven are possible) due to the unique X/α ratios and specific activities for the various isotopes. To make accurate assessments of the amount of material present from X-ray measurements, it is necessary to know the X/α ratio for the material under consideration. By knowing the isotopic composition and the isotopic X/α ratios, the material X/α ratio can be calculated or it can be measured directly from a sample of the material. At Battelle-Northwest we developed a system using solid state detectors to measure these X/α ratios. This paper describes the solid state system and some of its applications. The main developmental criteria were to maintain high efficiency and accuracy at low levels of activity. To meet these criteria, we built a coincidence system with high geometrical efficiency. The system uses a coaxial geometry with the alpha detector sandwiched between the source and X-ray detector. A 3 mm by 110 mm2 lithium-drifted-silicon detector cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature is used for X-ray detection. The alpha detector is a 40 V by 100 mm2 totally depleted surface barrier detector. Sources are either 0.635 or 1.58 cm diam electrodepositions of the material on stainless steel planchets which are placed on a rotatable disc 0."
"A magnetic Compton spectrometer is described which was designed to measure the gamma ray spectra from distributed, intense pulsed sources in the presence of gama ray, electron, and/or neutron backgrounds. It has been used to measure spectra of a nuclear device, the Sandia Pulsed Reactor, and the Hermes II flash x-ray machine. A discussion will be given of the design features, the data reduction, and the results of the Hermes II measurement."
"A novel approach for designing near-optimum filters for coaxial transmission lines carrying nuclear signals is here presented. The method involves a nonlinear least-squares fitting of the filter parameters to best-fit the desired ideal response. Unlike previous empirical methods to match the amplitude response of the cable, the fitting is done here to both amplitude and phase responses. The algorithm used in order to determine the best set of filter parameters is one that combines the best features of the gradient search method on the hypersufrace formed by the parameters, with the analytical solution of the fitting function, providing fast convergence. After the set of filter parameters that give the best fit to the ideal response is determined, the actual filter is designed. A computer program has been developed to do the fitting, the design, and to display the results in both tabular and graphical forms."
"A four-decade digital log ratemeter using integrated circuits for all active components has been designed and tested. The ratemeter is capable of measuring pulse rates ranging from 1.11 ×10-1 to 2.0 × 107 pulses per second. With a very simple modification the ratemeter can be made to have any desired number of decades in its output. The input pulse rate is determined by digital counting circuits and the logarithm of the pulse rate is approximated by seven digital functions which are generated by a series of combinational logic networks. The output is available in either digital or analog form. The system is composed of the following sections: Timing and Control, Counting, Transfer, Round-off, Log Converter, Storage, and Digital-to-Analog Converter. Experimental results have shown that the digital log ratemeter has for the same statistical accuracy a much faster response time than conventional log ratemeters. It was shown also that the digital log ratemeter is capable of being used to measure much lower pulse rates than is practical with conventional log ratemeters."
"A current-to-frequency converter with a single linear current range of 10-13 to 106 amperes has been developed for monitoring ion chamber currents. The converter has an output transfer function of 10-11 amperes/ Hz or 10-11 coulombs/count which is temperature compensated. Its frequency output, which is compatible with most scalers, yields a maximum linear rate of 105 Hz at 10-6 amperes input current."
"The preparation of large (100) oriented germanium crystals with net concentrations of electrically active impurities in the range 1-10 × 1010cm-3 is described. This material has been used successfully for the fabrication of semiconductor detectors having depletion layers up to 8 mm thick, without using lithium compensation. Electrical evaluation is performed by studying the Hall coefficient as a function of temperature, and by measuring the resistivity along the length at 77°K. Dislocation densities in most crystals range from 2000 to 5000 cm-2 Several dislocation-free crystals have also been grown. The oxygen concentration, measured by lithium precipitation, is approximately 1014 cm-3 in germanium grown from quartz crucibles and much less than this when grown from graphite. The solubility of lithium in pure, oxygen-free germanium is found to be 3.5 × 1013cm-3 at 23°C."
"A planar detector with a depletion layer width of 8mm has been fabricated from high purity germanium. A total system resolution of 2.4 keV at 1.33MeV is obtained with 600 volts bias on this detector. Another detector with a 3mm thick depletion region which was operated at 2000 volts bias yielded a system resolution of 1.65 keV at 1.33 MeV. Thin window detectors have been fabricated by using a glow discharge of BF3 or PF5. This technique has also been used to form ohmic contacts on high purity germanium."
"Determining the detector contribution or the total system resolution of a Ge(Li) detector by quadrature subtraction or addition of electronic noise introduces serious error due to the non-Gaussian effects of carrier trapping. The contributions of electronic noise and detector spread to the total system resolution are found by computer spectrum simulation to be greater than expected. The conclusions are substantiated by agreement with experimental measurements."
"The results of previously published studies relating to the trapping of charge carriers in semiconductor nuclear radiation detectors, including theoretical models and experimental data, have been used to construct a more realistic operational model which can be used to describe the trapping process. Specifically, the model has been developed for the situation most commonly reported in the literature, that of electron trapping in planar Ge(Li) detectors. The success of the present model has been judged on its ability to predict the variation of the peak shape resulting from γ-irradiation of a planar Ge(Li) detector as a function of applied bias. Full-energy γ-ray peaks have been calculated with digital computation techniques by incorporating the variation of peak amplitude as a function of charge collection efficiency as well as the variation of carrier lifetime with applied field into a previously published model."
"New results have been obtained for the temperature dependence of ε, the average energy required to create an electron-hole pair by ionizing radiation, for α particles incident on lithium-drifted silicon surface barrier detectors. For temperatures between 31 and 291°K, the application of fields up to 104 v/cm resulted in a saturated pulse height, which eliminated the necessity for extrapolation procedures to determine ε. Between 4.2 and 31°K pulse height saturation was not observed. Below 31°K the presence of both fast and slow risetime components in the detector pulse prevented an accurate determination of the pulse height. A significant difference between the present results and those previously reported is that ε plotted vs the energy gap gives a linear curve over the entire range reported (31-291°K)."
"The continuing improvement in energy resolution of semiconductor detector X-ray spectrometers has led to interest in the use of these devices at energies less than 2 keV. This is an energy region of potential analytical interest since the K X rays of several elements of biological and chemical importance occur at these energies. However, the low X-ray fluorescence yield in low-Z elements, combined with the absorption of low-energy X rays due to the entry window of the vacuum chanber and that of the detector, have made work in this energy region impossible with the standard semiconductor detector X-ray spectrometers. In the present work, the X-ray absorption path has been reduced to a minimum to permit low-energy X ray studies of excitation, entry window thickness, detector linearity and resolution. Using electron beam excitation on low-Z targets, we have performed measurements of characteristic K X rays of elements down to and including carbon (277 eV)."
"Silicon surface-barrier detectors have been irradiated at room temperature with monoenergetic electrons in the energy range of 200 keV to 1 MeV. The changes of detector reverse leakage current, noise, capacitance and alpha-particle counting response were determined. In general, detector current and noise increased with electron fluence and energy for electron energies of 400 keV and above. Detector capacitances tended to decrease slightly for electron fluences up to 1013 cm-2 and increase at higher fluences. No significant degradation of detector performance was observed as a result of irradiation with 200-keV electrons for fluences up to 1016 cm-2. The effects of damage on detector performance were reduced when the rear, aluminum contact was irradiated rather than the front, gold contact."
"\"Pure\" Barium Fluoride has been found to scintillate to gamma rays and alpha and beta particles. Pulse height of 10% relative to NaI(Tl), emission decay of 0.63 microseconds, fluorescence emission maximum at 3250A have been measured for currently available crystals of BaF2. This paper describes the scintillation performance and pertinent physical properties of BaF2 in relation to some of the commercially available scintillators -- NaI (Tl), CsI(Na), CsI(Tl) and CaF2 (Eu). The low solubility, non-hygroscopic nature and a comparable absorption for gamma rays are particular advantages of BaF2 over the alkali iodide scintillators. Transmission to its fluorescence emission, shorter decay time and a better photelectric absorption cross-section favor BaF2 over CaF2 scintillators. However, the scintillation pulse height of BaF2 is presently lower than the other scintillators, but it is still sufficiently large enough to observe a resolvable Cs137 662 Kev photopeak. The mechanism responsible for scintillation in BaF2 is not well understood at present. A preliminary investigation to understand this mechanism was undertaken in the form of adding impurities of various valencies to BaF2 and also studying the behavior of scintillation with temperature. The data seems to indicate that hole-centers may be playing a primary role in the scintillation emission. An understanding of the mechanism and the improvement and development of BaF2 as a scintillator has been an integral part of the High Z Scintillator Research program maintained for some time by Harshaw."
"A method of calibration of the Moxon-Rae type gamma-ray detectors used in neutron capture crosssection measurements with underground nuclear explosions is described. The method consists of measuring the activation and detector signal in individual resonances in samples of 197Au and 238U exposed to a neutron beam from an underground nuclear explosion. The resonances are resolved by time of flight. Since both the activation and the corresponding detector signal are known, the efficiency can be determined without measuring the incident neutron flux or sample capture cross section."
"Slow pulses from various types of Ge(Li) detectors, i.e., a planar, a coaxial, a thin p+-contact planar, and a 'back-to-back' double planar detector, have been studied by using a gamma-ray scanning technique and a risetime selector. A large and abrupt increase in the counting rates of the slow pulses were observed when the n+-i and the i-p boundaries of these detectors were irradiated by a collimated gamma-ray beam. Slow pulses contributed to background counts in the pulse height distributions. Slow pulses from a deeply depleted n+-p detector made from a high-purity p-type germanium crystal were also investigated."
"Comparison tests conducted with standard Pilot B scintillator and Pilot B with 10 times the normal concentration of wave shifter show the latter to exhibit an output pulse ~1½ times as large when viewed with an RCA C31000D GaP first dynode photomultiplier tube. These results bear out a conclusion reached after analyzing the results of a previous study of plastic s cintillators."
"Delay time and gain for a Bendix 4028 Channeltron was studied during accelerated life tests. The results are presented along with a suggestion for delay compensation. Novel means for synchronous stimulation of the multiplier and for measurement of the output charge are presented."
"Magnetic thin-film memory units of a new transient-recording system designed for nuclear data acquisition were tested for radiation hardness. The films were exposed to neutron and gamma doses on the order of 1012 n/cm2 and 104 R, respectively. Analog signals stored in the films were photographed using a Suchow powder technique before and after the exposure."
"Some properties of five germanium spectrometers made from two adjacent slices of a crystal of high purity p-type germanium are described. Techniques used to put contacts on conventional Ge(Li) detectors were used, but found to be somewhat unsatisfactory for the high purity material."
"Since 1964 the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform spacecraft data systems have used MOSFET devices. Many millions of device hours have been accumulated from IMPs D,E,F and G in orbit without any \"proven failures\" (two possible non-catastrophic failures may have occurred on MOSFET chips in IMP-D well after a year in orbit). We are now using the fourth generation of MOSFET blocks in IMPs H&J where there are approximately 1000 devices on a single chip. Historically, the development of MOSFET blocks for the IMP program has progressed through four phases. The PHASE I blocks contained about 10 devices/chip, PHASE II about 50, PHASE III about 200 and presently the PHASE IV blocks contain about 1000 devices/chip. The PHASE IV data system now under fabrication uses approximately one-half million devices. This two orders of magnitude increase in the number of devices per chip, while vastly increasing the capability of the data system, has also revised the thinking used in system design and has revised the reliability approach used."
"An instrument to measure the energy spectrum of auroral electrons and protons has been developed and is operational in orbit aboard ATS-5. It uses cylindrical coordinate electrostatic analyzers for detection of electrons and protons in the range of 50 eV to 50 keV. The analyzers focus these particles onto channel electron multipliers, which are followed by special-purpose amplifier-discriminator electronics. These electronics protect against counting losses due to gain degradation attributable to fatigue and to recovery effects associated with high counting rates. The pulse amplifiers have a dynamic range of 1000:1 and resolve 1-μs pulse pairs. Their fixed dead time (td) permits accurate correction to be made for counting rates exceeding l/td. A fast, ultrastable, programmable high-voltage scan system provides differential voltages between 0 and 6400 V in 62 exponential steps to the analyzer plates for energy selection. A digital servo permits either continuous sequential scanning over the 1000:1 range in energy, or automatic tracking of a spectral peak. Digital compression techniques are used to provide maximum data transfer to the spacecraft telemetry."
"A data system technology is described which relies on standby redundancy, automated flexibility, and extensive use of LSI devices to achieve the desired mission results. The STAR computer is the heart of the system and is truly an advanced next-generation spacecraft computer. Extensive use of large-scale integrated circuits has made it possible to implement the needed complexity throughout the advanced data system for the Grand Tour mission."
"A measurement program has been undertaken to investigate design criteria for satellite-borne Ge(Li) detector systems. The resolution, pulse height, reverse current and efficiency have been measured as a function of temperature and bias voltage for large Ge(Li) detectors. For space applications the important parameters are the knees (rapid changes) in the resolution and leakage current versus temperature. These features are observed to vary appreciably from detector to detector."
"The amplifier described is designed for use with uncooled silicon nuclear particle detectors connonly used in space instruments. The charge sensitive preamplifier and two-stage shaping amplifier provides the performance of a laboratory quality instrument while simultaneously satisfying the stringent requirements imposed upon flight hardware. Double differentiation-double integration (DDDI) pulse shaping with pole-zero cancellation of the preamplifier decay time constant was selected on the basis of simplicity, adequate noise performance, and stabillity at high count rates. The components used in the design are compatible with hybrid microcircuit fabrication. Noise performance at 1 μsec DDDI time constants was measured to be 1.8 KeV + 47 eV/pf FWHM (Silicon) for an amplifier consuming 100 mW. The operating temperature range is approximately -40° to +80°C. Further results of an extensive testing program are reported."
"A charge sensitive FET amplifier and coincidence system for solid state detectors and random counting rates of 350,000/sec is described. The fully depleted Si surface barrier detectors are decoupled to the FET input stages of the preamplifiers which produce pulses of 30 ns risetime with a 100 ns decay constant. The postamplifiers are integrating and differentiating and generate negative going bipolar pulses of 1 μs length. The dynamic range goes from 25 mV to 5 volts at a stability of 3% over a temperature range from -30°C to +50°C. With 60 pf input capacity the noise is 38 KeV. A set of threshold discriminators rejects noise and strobes the subsequent zero crossovers detectors. The outputs are square pulses which activate a 40 ns tunnel diode coincidence circuit. The power consumption of the complete system is 150 mw. Miniaturized PC board construction is used for packaging."
"A circuit has been developed which allows excitation of charge sensitive amplifiers at high pulse repetition rates. The amplifier output waveform fidelity is nearly as good as that associated with low repetition rate mercury relay pulsers. The circuit may be self-contained or operated under external control by supplying a reference voltage and clock signals to initiate pulses. The elements of the pulser are discussed in detail, and some applications are suggested. The circuit has been tested for amplitude stability as a function of temperature and pulse repetition rate."
"A new approach to computer-based data acquisition and control for multiple, diverse, and remote laboratories is described. Modular techniques are used in the programming system, as well as in the input-output and instrument interfacing facilities. The system is designed to achieve some of the benefits of multiprocessing systems, but at lower cost and with higher system efficiency. Ease of use is stressed throughout, and language processors developed to help achieve that goal are described. An example of initial use is presented."
"A crate controller that provides an economical interface between the CAMAC dataway and the I/O bus of computers such as the Lockheed MAC-16 has been designed. One such controller is required for each crate. The controllers are capable of transferring commands from the computer to a single module or to several modules in one or more crates simultaneously. They can also perform 16 or 24-bit word data transfers between the computer and an addressed module. In addition, parallel logic is provided for determining the complete address of the highest priority interrupt source. This includes the station number (L) of the interrupting module and the Look-at-Me (LAM) source within this module. Each controller is built in a double-width CAMAC module and is implemented with 135 integrated circuit packages."
"The 8 GeV Booster Synchrotron, presently under construction at the National Accelerator Laboratory, is controlled by a computer based system, which has been implemented using the CAMAC Standard for data handling systems. The design philosophy and the hardware for the control system are described."
"An on-line data acquisition and analysis system has recently been placed in operation to support the research programs at the Texas A&M University Variable Energy Cyclotron facility. The system consists of an IBM 7094 computer and a programmable experiment-computer interface unit. The interface is a logical extension of the computer system, thereby insuring hardware and software compatibility."
"The Sandia Data Acquisition and Display System (DADS) is being used in a time-shared, real-time mode to support basic and applied radiation research. Five remote terminals provide computer access for experiments such as electron beam diagnostics, fast neutron spectrum measurements, static and dynamic reactor fuels testing and neutron damage studies on solid state electronic components. The system has substantially increased radiation facility and experimenter efficiency. This paper describes the DADS and demonstrates its utility by discussing some of the experiments that are currently interfaced to the system."
"A program for use with multiparameter pulse height analysis is described. The main purpose of the program is to permit reasonably rapid accumulation of data into arrays which are much smaller than implied by the range of descriptors. In addition the method readily permits the use of descriptors which exceed the bit capacity of the computer word. Any grouping of zero and non-zero channels as is observed in most real spectra is especially exploited. In many cases, the data can be retained in a packed array in core memory until the actual number of non-zero channels becomes almost as large as the allotted core-memory space, at which time the array is transferred to another space in core (where it will be transferred onto disc as a background operation), the core array is reinitialized, and the data acquisition is continued. With this procedure, multichannel arrays as large as the available disc memory can be stored on disc without the data acquisition suffering from the very slow random access time of the disc. Methods of data handling and the resulting effective counting rates are discussed."
"Douglas United Nuclear engineers have developed and refined a computerized data program for the Hanford nuclear reactor complex over an eight-year period. This program is used for the recording, checking, handling, and utilization of large amounts of test and inspection data on nuclear plant protective systems. The program features data collection at the system level, yet it readily permits data collection at the equipment, component, or failure mode level as needed. Systems critical to nuclear safety, operating availability, or the life of the Hanford reactors are protected by special mandatory testing procedures. Performance data on critical systems generated by these procedures are normally obtained at the system level. The results of these tests are recorded on check (or data) sheets which are contained in a set of Critical Equipment Test Procedures. The test procedures are, in turn, basically derived from the Technical Specifications. These check sheets contain coding and keypunch designations for classifying and inputting the data to the Critical Systems Data File. The data are processed through the data file to audit performance against established criteria and to store the data for retrieval by special analyses programs. The use of this data file provides an automated data processing and storage system which eliminates manual searching and extraction of data from written records and simplifies the inputting of data to other programs. Routine processing programs automatically compare the data with pre-established limits, report out-of-limit conditions, and audit functional test and inspection completions."
"In many nuclear physics experiments an event consists of correlated output pulses from several radiation detectors. We call each separate output pulse a parameter. The experiments with which we are dealing are multiparameter experiments. We have constructed a system in which a single ADC is interfaced to a general purpose computer. Multiparameter experiments are handled by storing the several pulses in analog stretchers and using the ADC repeatedly to digitize the several pulses in sequence. This approach is made practical by the availability of a very fast ADC. The system includes features that give it unusual flexibility for handling complicated time relationships among the pulses. The use of one rather than several ADC's makes the system simpler, more compact, and less expensive than multiple ADC systems. Provisions are included for evaluating counting loss due to dead time of the system for random or non-random event distributions. The data transfer logic incorporates the facility for including digital information from devices in addition to the ADC in each event datum."
"A small digital computer has been successfully interfaced to nuclear counting systems in a plutonium recovery facility. The counting systems are used to measure plutonium content of waste and process residues. The computer initializes the counting sequence, accepts the data, computes the plutonium content, and prints the documented information."
  "A system utilizing immersed acoustic noise detectors to detect boiling is one possible solution to the problem of detecting loss of cooling in a fuel channel of a liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactor. Two models of a symmetric drive sensor incorporating lithium niobate as the piezoelectric element have been fabricated and tested for acoustic response in water at room temperature and in an air furnace up to 600°C. Sensitivities of both models were 500pC/bar, with acoustic response to 100kHz when immersed in water. The sensors were not adversely affected by exposure in the furnace. Decreasing internal resistance with increasing temperature limits the useful range of present models to about 540°C."
"Analysis of neutron fluctuations produced by coolant pressure oscillations and of neutron noise were investigated as two possible boiling detection methods during a boiling experiment in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Neither method detected boiling because the void volume due to boiling was 0.007 in., which is less than the detection threshold for either method."
"New high temperature and broadband magnetostrictive and piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers have been developed for testing, measurement and control. Potential reactor applications include measuring fuel centerline temperature, sodium temperature profile (ten points with only one wire), occurrence and location of bubbles in liquid coolants, liquid level, flow, gas pressure, nondestructive testing and acoustic emission surveillance."
"The first two instrumented fueled subassemblies in EBR-II included permanent-magnet sodium flowmeters. The first operated for the duration of the test, four months, with no observable degradation. Its signal was about six percent below that calculated. The second flowmeter had been precalibrated in a sodium system. Operating data from EBR-II indicates that its sensitivity has been stable within three percent during the first 150 days in the core. Post-test examination will supply more conclusive data."
"A permanent-magnet, probe-type sodium flowsensor small enough to be inserted and removed through curved instrumentation guide tubes and positioned above fuel assembly outlet coolant channels in the FFTF has been developed and tested in out-of-pile dynamic sodium loops. Design and construction features, test results, and improved design considerations, are presented."
"An eddy-current probe-type flowsensor is being developed for the FFTF to indicate sodium flow velocity at the outlet of a fuel channel in a temperature range of 300°F to 1200°F and a velocity range of 0-18 fps. Design considerations, out-of-reactor tests, both dry and in sodium, were performed and results are presented. Typical sensitivity of 0.6 mV rms/ft-sec has been obtained with excellent stability."
"An improved alarm system to detect and warn against uncontrolled nuclear criticality events has been developed for the Hanford site. The system is neutron sensitive with an alarm threshold of 8 millirad/hour of \"steady\" neutron irradiation or 4 microrad of pulsed radiation. Redundancy techniques and self-check features have been incorporated whenever possible to enhance operational reliability."
"For optimum operation of fast breeder reactors, knowledge of the incore power and breeding distributions is desirable. Because of the high temperature liquid sodium environment in the breeders, an activation method rather than a technique involving ion chambers seems to be the most appropriate experimental technique at present. An activation system has been worked out in which 1/16\" BeO balls containing oxides of 235U and 238U are inserted into the reactor for activation and withdrawn to be counted in a Ge(Li) counter. Measurements of the activated fission and 239Np gamma-rays yield the desired information. Parameters and procedures are obtained based on a specific fast Demonstration Breeder design. However, only slight modification would be required for the application to other breeders."
"For combating not only general deviations in total power, but localized flux (power) perturbations as well, separate control systems are designed for separate cores of the coupled-core reactor. In this paper conditions are obtained for global asymptotic stability of a coupled core reactor including its control system. The results obtained here for stability are in the form of the weaker Popov condition, which allows the determination of stability geometrically in the frequency domain. An example of a coupled core reactor with typical parameters is given to illustrate the ease involved in the determination of stability."
"An on-line, digital data handling and optimal control system based upon a PDP8s, general purpose, programmable digital computer, has been developed and tested at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR), a 5 megawatt, thermal, flux-trap type nuclear reactor. The instrumentation which has been successfully interfaced to the small digital computer includes a 100 channel, 250 Hz, randomly addressable reed scanner; a 10-bit, 100 kHz, analog-to-digital converter; a 60 Hz real time clock which provides a hardware interrupt every 16.7 milliseconds; and two relay contact outputs. Software which has been implemented includes a real-time executive which schedules eight different tasks in a specified priority and periodic scheme, a console utility package which allows direct, on-line, communication between computer core memory and the ASR-33 teletype, an analog signal input task, various control algorithms, an output task, and a systems log task. The automatic control algorithms are dependent upon the physical parameters of the reactor system. These parameters may be periodically identified by on-line dynamic testing and the control decision algorithm may be modified accordingly. Methods of z-transform analysis are applied in a linearized approach to the problem of representing each component of the closed-loop reactor, computer control system. The optimization theory based on the maximum principle of L. S. Pontryagin has been applied in an effort to improve the control calculations with respect to minimum time response. Testing methods used were hybrid computer simulation and on-line parameter input studies at the MURR."
"This paper presents a design procedure for selecting the optimal parameters of a filter used in extracting true signals from noisy reactor measurements. The equations for the optimal filter are presented and a procedure is given for approximating the optimal filter with a simpler and less expensive structure. A design example demonstrates how the method may be applied to a reactor protection system."
"The problem of controlling the spatial power distribution in a reactor core under changing load conditions is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. The one-dimensional distributed core model is approximated by using finite differences to obtain a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Linear programming is then used in an iterative scheme to determine the optimum control rod strategy."
"In the study of reactor system stability, the past work is mainly concentrated in two areas: the study of reactor core stability using either the point model or distributed model, and the study of plant dynamics using a lumped parameter model with time delay. The former study assumed no interaction between the core dynamics and the rest of the components in the system whereas the latter neglected the distributed effect, thus some salient features in the system may be lost. The work presented in this paper analyzes the stability of a distributed reactor system which consists of the core dynamics with nonlinear temperature feedbacks, the external primary heat exchanger, and the coolant loop interconnecting these two major components. The coupled set of nonlinear partial differential equations is treated directly without recourse to the usual lumped parameter approximation. An extension of Lyapunov's theory, which has been successfully used in the study of distributed core dynamics, is employed to obtain stability criteria for this coupled system."
"The importance of spatial effects in proposed transfer-function measurements in large, fast reactors was investigated. A general theoretical formulation of space-dependent transfer-functions is derived which includes the effects of input and output device spatial characteristics. A quantitative indication of spatial effects is given by numerical simulation of measured transfer-functions in a Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR). An approximate method of solution using the Galerlkin's procedure was developed in conjunction with the investigation."
"Identification of plant parameters in a nonlinear space-dependent reactor system based on simulated measurements has been accomplished. The quasilinearization iterative technique provides the computational capability for solving the nonlinear equations in the identification process. Examples of the identification of feedback temperature coefficients in one and two neutron energy group nonlinear models with linear temperature feedback are presented."
"The precision of reactor noise techniques for measuring subcritical reactivity can be related to detector efficiency and parameters of the measuring instrumentation. Using a two-detector cross-correlation technique, we have determined that such measurements can be made in a certain fast reactor (the FFTF) to -3 to -5 dollars with acceptable statistics and measurement times."
"An automatic-ranging picoammeter covering full-scale ranges from 3 X 10-11 to 1 X 10-3amperes with a 50% over-range capability has been designed, built, tested, and installed for use with Babcock & Wilcox's Lynchburg Pool Reactor. The unit incorporates three major improvements over previous instrumentation and commercially available equipment: (1) elimination of manual range changing, (2) provision for adjustable power level trips throughout the operating range of the reactor, and (3) provision for a trip function upon detection of a period shorter than that preset into the instrument."
"A reliable modular protective system has been designed, tested, and installed on the Lynchburg Pool Reactor (LPR). Solid-state and integrated circuit technology has been used throughout in the design of all modules. These module designs can be easily duplicated for use at other research reactor facilities, and the system is flexible enough to accommodate changing requirements."
"This paper summarizes the changes made to the instrumentation and control equipment at Connecticut Yankee since plant startup. There have been additional changes made in the design of Maine Yankee's control system beyond those already made in Connecticut. These fall into two categories: the first is changes to the nuclear steam supplier's package as a result of what we have learned from experience with our operating plants; the other category includes the additions made to the basic instrumentation for operator ease and improved performance. These changes between Connecticut and Maine Yankee designs are described. Much of the change seen between these two plants can be ascribed to the requirements of the AEC criteria and to the increased size, complexity and cost of the plant. Other changes result from the differing approaches taken by different NSSS vendors. The owner's viewpoint and experience is important in reviewing proposed instrumentation as well as any other plant feature. The paper shows the variety of features we have felt important to improve upon, based upon our experience."
  "The mathematical models for a reactor protective system were developed for sensitivity analysis. The models are for the two-out-of-four coincidence logic configuration and reflect the \"spurious trip\" and \"no trip\" system failure modes. The models, developed from conditional probabilities and series chain configuration techniques, are adaptable to other coincidence logic schemes as well. An example is included to demonstrate the sensitivity analysis technique."
"Reliability analysis is playing an increasingly important role in quantitative assessment of system performance for assuring nuclear safety, improving plant performance and plant life, and reducing plant operating costs. In particular, fault tree analysis with probability evaluation provides an all inclusive, versatile mathematical tool for analyzing complex systems. Its application can include a complete plant as well as any of the systems and subsystems. Fault tree analysis provides an objective basis for analyzing system design, performing trade-off studies, analyzing common mode failures, demonstrating compliance with AEC requirements, and justifying system changes or additions. The logic of the approach makes it readily understandable and, therefore, it serves as an effective visibility tool for both engineering and management."
"Fault tree methods and reliability engineering techniques are used at the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) principally to evaluate reactor protective and safeguard systems. The particular analytical technique called \"Kinetic Tree Theory\", with the associated computer programs, is used to obtain quantitative probabilistic characteristics regarding the safety and reliability of these systems. Once the fault tree or block diagram is drawn, the Kinetic Tree Theory technique automatically yields detailed time-dependent information forevery component, for every minimal cut set (critical path) and for the system itself. The computer time needed for this detailed analysis is negligible. In actual application, the fault tree and reliability engineering techniques, with the quantitative evaluations by Kinetic Tree Theory, have yielded results which verify the practical value of these types of safety and reliability analyses."
"One of the most powerful and widely used techniques in the field of reliability analysis is the Fault Tree. In Fault Tree analysis, component failures or conditions (basic events) are graphically depicted in the necessary combinations to cause subsystem or system failures (secondary events). Application of probability theory to the logic scheme thus depicted permits computation of system failure probability where the probabilities of the basic events are known."
"This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of availability design goals for determining required periodic test intervals and allowable bypass times as permitted by IEEE-279 criteria. Formulas are developed for calculating these times for instrumentation logic configurations common to reactor protection systems. Both simultaneous and uniformly staggered test schedules are considered. In addition to sample problems illustrating the application of these formulas, nomographs are presented for rapid graphical determination of test intervals and bypass times."
"The concept of probabilistic analysis is recommended as a practical tool for developing design cri1teria and goals. The proposed procedure and the basic principles are developed in detail. Practical applications of the probabilistic approach are included at the end of the paper."

 "The CAMAC instrumenatation system developed by the ESONE Committee of European laboratories has been endorsed by the U. S. AEC NIM Committee as a dataway system complementary to the NIM (Nuclear Instrument Module) system. CAMAC is described in a general way in this introductory paper which is followed by papers that discuss the system in greater detail and describe typical implementation."
"The basic purpose of CAMAC is to provide a standardized method for transmitting data and control information between instrumentation modules and a digital controller. CAMAC encompasses both a hardware standard for housing the modular components of a system and an electrical and logical standard for the control \"language\" used in the transfer of digital information. The CAMAC specification contains the rules for both of these aspects of CAMAC. This paper describes the features and uses of the control language in a less formal way than must be used in the specification. Examples are given of the interplay of control and synchronization signals between the modules concerned. Other papers in this series consider other aspects of CAMAC, including its place in the context of instrumentation systems, hardware aspects, signal standards, the Branch Highway, and coupling to computers and control systems. Here, the scope is limited to the process of information interchange within the CAMAC crate. This paper is designed to supplement the CAMAC specification. The reader is advised to obtain a copy of that document, and to read it first. The reader's attention is also called to other references containing informal descriptions ot the CAMAC system."
"This paper presents a short summary and description of the CAMAC Branch Highway. The purpose of the Branch and some of its characteristics are explained. Certain operational sequences are described in detail. The paper is designed to supplement the CAMAC Branch Highway Specification, and is one of a series of papers on CAMAC topics."
  "The typical CAMAC system has a small computer attached to it. In the usual case, the computer acts as a repository for data generated by CAMAC, and also controls and directs the CAMAC operations. This paper discusses some of the aspects of the hardware interface, and also some of the interaction between the computer and the CAMAC system."
"Several computer controlled CAMAC systems are presently being developed at Argonne for data acquisition in low-energy nuclear physics. This paper discusses four of these. The systems are designed around 8K, 16-bit, Lockheed MAC-16 computers. A typical system includes two CAMAC crates and a complement of 15 modules. The crate controller in each crate serves as interface between the computer I/O bus and the CAMAC dataway. Up to 14 individual crates can be addressed in addition to a Teletype and other peripheral devices. The CAMAC modules being developed include Crate Controller, Dual ADC Controller, ADC Coincidence Unit, Dual Stabilizer, Quad Pre-Scaler, Clock, Display Controller, Readout Selector, Magnetic Tape Controller and Disk Controller. Most units are built in double-width modules using computer controlled wire-wrap construction."
"This report describes a system of electronics to be used with a proportional wire chamber hodoscope. The system, which uses CAMAC packaging and data handling philosophy, consists of octo (8 channel) wire signal amplifiers, octo 4-bit per wire latch modules, gate fanout modules, crate controllers, and two types of data processor-interface units to the SDS 9300 computer. System operation is explained, and each component is described."
"The control system for the National Accelerator Laboratory's Booster Synchrotron is compatible with the CAMAC standard which represents the first application of this standard to a large process control system. Parts of the system are presently installed and have operated successfully."
"The use of CAMAC has been proposed in the experimental area of one of the nation's newest particle accelerators. This paper will describe briefly the computer-based data system to be implemented and how CAMAC might solve the interface problem."
"A data acquisition system for high energy physics experiments is described here, which is in accordance with the specifications of EUR 4100e and EUR 4600e. This is a multicrate system using branch highway and type A crate controllers. Most of the components are now commercially available."
"Is everyone going to use CAMAC? Probably not. Does CAMAC represent the latest thinking in data handling? Again the answer is no. However, one must remember that the time from conception to delivery of a computer makes it partially obsolete before it is ever used. This is the price of progress. A similar gestation time is inevitable for CAMAC. If we were to begin today, CAMAC would be different, but at this point in time we cannot start over. CAMAC is the only system with any chance of wide-spread acceptance in the near future. We intend to take advantage of its opportunities right away."
"The present TRAC Ebers-Moll model is modified in order to obtain an improved high frequency prediction. This is achieved by means of a three lump Linvill model to account for diffusion transport of minority carriers in the base region of a bipolar transistor. The modified Ebers-Moll model obtained in this manner yields two pole representations for the transport factors in the frequency domain. The two pole representation for hfe is shown to give reasonable fit both in amplitude and phase with experimental data obtained from a low frequency bipolar transistor, while the phase correlation obtained with the single pole representation of the present TRAC Ebers-Moll model is unsatisfactory, especially, at high frequencies. The present TRAC Ebers-Moll model was also modified so as to obtain an improvement in collector storage and recovery time prediction. This was accomplished by the introduction of two Linvill lumps in the collector region to account for minority carrier storage and transport. The observed experimental collector-base diode turn-off transient response for the same low frequency bipolar transistor was found to be in agreement with the prediction of the modified model. Finally, the paper is concluded with a discussion of a modified model to account for both the high frequency response, as well as, collector storage and recovery time effects."
"In a previous communication the advantages and the performance of foil supported wires for counter arrays were described, and we hinted at rate limitations caused by voltage drop in the resistive foil. The non-uniform material properties which are never quite ruled out initially and often develop under irradiation, particle bombardment etc. - at least on the surface of organic foils, and the recent increase of stable gas-amplification make these limitations severe beyond our first expectation. This is a preliminary report on a changed approach: we use a good insulator for supporting the foil and eliminate the field distortion caused by surface charges through a self shielding geometry described below."
"Permanent changes in the frequency versus temperature characteristics of unswept and swept optical grade synthetic quartz AT resonators which are caused by fast neutron and Co60 irradiations have been investigated. Neutron damage shifts the frequency versus temperature characteristics of the unswept resonators upwards in frequency across the entire zero to + 120°C temperature range at a rate of 0.56 × 10-15 ppm per N/cm2, which is the smallest value yet reported in the literature. The observed erratic results for swept resonators were attributed to effects of ionizing radiation accompanying the neutron fluence and led to the Co60> investigation. The unswept optical grade quartz was found to provide AT resonators which are more resistant to ionizing radiation than any other unswept material yet investigated in the literature. Appreciable amounts of acoustically active defects attributed to Na inpurities which were apparently gaded during sweeping were indicated by the Co results for the swept devices and made the swept devices useless as radiation resistant resonators."
"The fabrication and characterization of high purity germanium radiation detectors are described. These detectors are n-i-p diodes with a shallow (1.5μ) diffused junction and a noninjecting metal-semiconductor contact. The germanium has a net acceptor concentration of approximately 7 × 1011 cm-3 and contamination during processing was prevented by using clean procedures and a KCN treatment. Electrical measurements show that with 500 volts of bias these detectors are fully depleted and have a capacitance of approximately 4.5 pf. Detection characteristics are determined from measurements of γ-rays and x-rays over the energy range of 6 keV to 136 keV. A deviation from linearity of less than ± 0.2 percent was measured. The resolution of the detectors is characterized by an effective Fano factor of 0.12. The average energy expended per created pair was determined to be 2.95 ±0.02 eV at 90°K."
"We describe a system which makes use of the conventional means of controlling the terminal voltage of an electrostatic accelerator (FN Tandem) by shunt current from corona points. The voltage is sensed with a beam-deflection system or a generating-voltmeter (GVM) signal, or a combination of the two methods. The electronic design differs considerably from previous designs, the emphasis being placed upon functional simplicity, reliability, and ease of operation. The performanance results are indicative of the use of SF6 as a filling gas."
"The fast neutron induced degradation of the electrical characteristics of n-channel GaAs junction field effect transistors (JFET's) operating in the Shockley mode (thermal equilibrium) was estimated previously. Advances in technology have led to the fabrication of devices with micron sized channel lengths which are capable of response at microwave frequencies. Short channel lengths, however, result in device operation under thermal nonequilibrium conditions and hot electron effects must be considered. The theory of Lehovec and Zuleeg, which provides the characteristics for JFET's operating in the hot electron range, is employed in this paper to estimate the neutron degradation of these devices. It is shown that JFET's operating in the hot electron range are more resistant to neutron exposure than are JFET's operating in the Shockley region. Devices with channel doping concentration of 1017 cm-3 are predicted to survive fluences of 1016 neutrons/cm2. Some preliminary test results are reported."
"An improved, low-noise, wide-band current preamplifier was developed for use with a fission counter having a 100-nsec electron collection time. The signal-to-noise ratio of the preamplifier and its insensitivity to component parameter variations and temperature changes exceed that of any commercially available unit. A differential version was developed to exploit the balanced configuration of the counter. A 20% improvement in signal-to-noise ratio was obtained with good common-mode rejection from 50 kHz to 30 MHz."

    "Radiotherapy is unique as a medical specialty in that it depends upon physical sources of energy deposition within tissues to bring about profound and complex biological changes for the purpose of eradicating cancerous growths. Thus, it has the broadest interface with both physical and biological sciences of any clinical discipline. It is for this reason that progress in radiotherapy is continually stimulated by advances in bothphysical and biological sciences. In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on high energy particle radiations as possible additions to the therapeutic armamentarium, in an effort to improve the results obtainable with x and y radiations. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how some accelerator produced radiations, fast neutrons and Π mesons, might be of potential value to radiotherapy."
 "A review is given of existing sources of highly charged heavy ions. The performance of the sources, predominantly of the P.I.G. type, are summarized and compared. Some mechanisms for the production of high charge states are described. There is a brief description of new developments, particularly of devices using ion trapping."
"The stored energy in dc accelerators capable of reaching terminal potentials of 30 or 40 MV is more than an order of magnitude greater than in existing machines. To analyze the concentration of electrical fields under surge conditions the accelerator has been modeled by lumped constant networks. The analysis shows that in structures similar to the present ones the voltage distribution during a surge is very uneven and micro-discharges in the tube can initiate complete accelerator collapse."
"The 30 MeV 3-stage Van de Graaff facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory achieved the desired operating specifications on July 28, 1970 and has been in operation on various research programs since. The facility consists of two MP Tandem Van de Graaff accelerators arranged in line with a negative ion source installed in the terminal of the first accelerator. The two accelerators can either be used as separate Tandem accelerators or together in a 3-stage configuration. Proton energies as high as 30.5 MeV with currents as high as 4 microamperes have been obtained."
"A review is given of early development work at the University of Wisconsin on electrostatic accelerators insulated by high pressure gas. This work started in 1933 and led in 1940 to a 4.5MeV accelerator. Starting in 1946 development work was initiated along three lines: 1) Bakeable high strength metal to ceramic bonding, 2) Organic-free pumping, 3) Metal charge carrying devices. In 1951 construction was started at the University of Wisconsin on an accelerator utilizing results of these three development programs. In 1965 much development work was transferred to the National Electrostatics Corp. where the charging chain was developed. It consists of metal cylinders joined by links of solid insulating material. A 1MV column support unit was perfected which is used to construct column modules. A bakeable all metal and ceramic tube, free of organic vapors was developed. It consists of short sections bolted together with three sections per column module. A three-stage accelerator was built and was tested with a beam up to energies of 22MeV. A two-stage accelerator to provide 28MeV protons (14MV on terminal) is under construction. A two-stage accelerator to give 40MeV protons (20MV on terminal) has been designed."
"Charge-state fractions have been determined for iodine, selenium and bromine ions traversing oxygen, argon, krypton, xenon, carbon-foil and gold-foil targets. Particular attention has been paid to high charge states, some containing as little as 10-6% of the primary beam intensity. The measurements indicate that a TU tandem accelerator is capable of delivering useful beams of heavy elements up to bromine (including 82Se and 48Ca) with energies suitable for the research of super-heavy elements."
"The performance of the ANL 4-MV Dynamitron accelerator using a Danfysik heavy-ion source is briefly described. Using CC14 support gas, 2 μA beams of 58Ni+ were obtained at 3.5 MeV and 6 μA beams at 2 MeV by optimizing source chemistry."
"The new 5 MeV electrostatic ion accelerator, projected, built, and tested at the Central Research Institute for Physics in Budapest, with some necessary aid from Hungarian industry /pressure vessel etc./ is described. The accelerator's main specifications are detailed and an account is given of the experiences with glass and porcelain accelerating tubes. By careful design, the intensity of radiation in the range of 4-5 MV has been reduced by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Without an ion beam there was only 3-5 times the intensity of the natural radiation background /i.e. less than 0.5 mR/h/ on the outer surface of the generator vessel when operated at 4-5 MV. The radiation level with the accelerated ion beam is accordingly also very low. During a 7-month period in 1970 the generator ran for 3,250 hours of measurements in nuclear physics."
"A compact P.I.G. ion source with pulsed field and end extraction is described. The source produces multiply ionized N, C, Ne, A, Kr and Xe. Pulsed currents of C3+, N3+, Ne3+, A3+, Kr3+ , Xe6+ between a few tens of μA and a few hundreds of μA have been obtained. Small size and power consumption make it compatible with a Van de Graaff terminal where space and power are at a premium."
 "A compact pulsed-bean ion source injector was developed and installed on The University of Texas Tandem Accelerator. The injector consists of a direct extraction negative ion source coupled to a 100 keV Coskroft-Walton accelerator. Improvements in the arrangement and fabrication of the high voltage components of the injector are discussed. R. F. pulsing and klystron bunching of the ion beam is done before entering the tandem and a simple inexpensive method of rejecting the retrace component of the pulsed beam is presented. Pertinent pulsed beam characteristics measured under fast neutron time-of-flight experimental conditions are given."
"To utilize the full current capability of the regular or symmetrical cascade generator, the conventional selenium rectifiers have to be replaced by a series-connection of silicon diodes which are rather sensitive to overvoltages and overcurrents. The problem of the application and protection of silicon diodes in high voltage generators had to be overcome in connection with the design of an air-insulated 770-kV dc power supply with a rated current of 180 mA dc for the ATOMIC ENERGY OF CANADA, LTD., Chalk River, Ontario and also for a 2 MV, 30 mA test facility."
"An expression for the maximum H- current obtainable from an H+ beam by charge exchange in hydrogen has served as a guide in the design and development of a source of H- ions for booster injection into the ZGS. Here it is used as a criterion in the evaluation of testbench results obtained with the present test source. Space and power limitations in the 750-keV terminal of the preinjector have led to the use of titanium sublimation pumping to handle large instantaneous gas loads. Power limitations and the need for high pumping conductance have led to the substitution of electrostatic deflection for magnetic deflection in the beam separator."
 "A heavy ion source of the PIG type has been installed on the axial injection line at the 88-Inch Cyclotron. It is now in the testing phase. Arc powers up to 4 kW have been run, and hydrogen and nitrogen beams have been injected and accelerated in the cyclotron."
"A pulsed voltage generator, called Frizz, has been designed and constructed at Sandia Laboratories and is now being used as a voltage source for breakdown studies of various materials. Frizz generates a nominal 100 ns pulse of variable risetime from 5 to 50 ns across a vacuum chamber in which dielectric test samples are placed."
 "The Dynamitron Tandem Accelerator is now fully operational at ANL. Measurements of beam performance are reported. The dc proton beam current obtained at 8.0 MeV was 53 μA. Peak pulsed proton and deuteron currents measured with a fast Faraday cup were 110.0 μA at 1.3 nsec FWHM and 700 μA at 2.0 nsec FWHM, respectively. Beam energy stability (ΔE at E) was less than 140 eV at 1.88 MeV and 820 eV at 6.00 MeV as indicated by the thin target yield of 7Li (p,n)7Be and 27A1 (p,n)27Si. Operational experience has shown that the system is highly reliable. The tandem has logged 1800 high voltage operational hours without any service to components within the pressure vessel, since the last opening of the machine over nine months ago."
"A cold cathode Penning discharge ion source, power supply, and its performance in the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC) are described. The ion source has operated at power levels as high as 8 kW and has produced a variety of particle beams, ranging from deuterium to xenon and with charge states up to +12. In particular, 20 eμA (electrical microampere) of 05+, 5 × 104 p/sec (particle per second) of 40Ar10+, and 107 p/sec of 132Xe12+ have been extracted from ORIC. From the known intensities of accelerated ions and the calculated total ionization potential, a means of predicting particle intensity for a given charge state has been developed."
"A negative ion source has been installed and operated reliably in the high-voltage terminal of the injector accelerator at the Brookhaven Three-stage MP Tandem Van de Graaff Facility. Negative ions extracted directly from an off-axis-type duoplasmatron are focused, mass analyzed, and pre-accelerated to match the beam optics of the acceleration tubes. The ions are then deflected through 90° onto the acceleration axis using an improved electrostatic mirror and steered for optimum beam transmission. Other design features include multiple control rods, TV telemetry, surge-protected power supplies, terminal vacuum pumping, closed-loop liquid cooling and high-speed insulating-gas transfer which permits quick access to the terminal. Beams in excess of 30 μA, 1H- and 5 μA, 16O- have been accelerated by the injector to over 9 MeV. Less intense beams have been further accelerated through all three stages to provide 30 MeV, 1H+ and 100 MeV, 16O8+ for experimental use."
"Negative heavy ions (O-, Cu-, AlO-, Au-) were injected into and accelerated through a one megavolt tandem accelerator. Transmission of the charge states was measured over a terminal voltage range of 300 - 1000 kilovolts. For all the heavy ions, the most abundant charge state at 1 megavolt terminal voltage was 2+ using oxygen stripper gas. Up to 0.57 particle microamperes of 2+ were measured."
"The high-intensity proton injector system of LAMPF has been in operation since June 1970. The injector system consists of a 750-keV Cockcroft-Walton (C-W) high-voltage generator, a duoplasmatron ion source, a Pierce geometry accelerating column, and a 45-ft long beam-transport system. After a preliminary period of initial testing, this injector was used to supply proton beams for beam tests on the first tank of the drift-tube linac of LAMPF. At the conclusion of these tests, more detailed studies of the operation of the various parts of the injector were resumed. The operational experience during the linac beam tests and the results obtained in the subsequent tests are presented. The system has met the design goals and in general has performed well. The emphasis of this paper, however, will be on the problems that have arisen and the work now in progress to improve the system."
"It is our belief that major advances in the generator voltages used in D. C. accelerator technology will only be achieved after the generators are designed for both D. C. operation and for the transient conditions that are present during discharge. There appears to be little doubt that the electrostatic energy is often converted into electromagnetic waves which excite a wide variety of oscillator modes. These modes can best be damped by including dissipative elements that are chosen to terminate or critically damp the oscillator circuit."
      "After a large development of our experimental studies on high stability oscillators, a theoretical work on different physical processes able to induce localized transitions to the normal state at high field level in superconducting cavities, is in progress. A theoretical study of beam dynamics in low energy electron linacs (in the 1-5 MeV range) shows that a standing wave structure have interesting focusing properties for short bunches injected in the \"unstable\" rhase domain, and that a single TM010 cavity could be used to obtain electrons of 2 MeV."
  "The design and construction of the accelerator is discussed. In particular, the design of the niobium accelerating structure, refrigerator, dewar, helium distribution system, and the injector and control system are described."
"The first section of the 1.3 GHz superconducting linac, being constructed for the proposed 600 MeV microtron, was installed into the cryostat and operated as an accelerator for the first time. An electron beam of 270 keV, chopped to a select phase spread of 6 degrees, was injected into the 3λ/2 niobium structure and accelerated to 1 MeV with an input of 30 watts of microwave power at 4.2°K. The accelerated beam was 2 mm in diameter 3 meters beyond the accelerating section. The energy spread was less than 1%. The niobium section had not been outgass d at high temperature and had a Q of 1.4 x 108. The energy gain seemed to be limited to about 1 MeV per foot by field emission, as indicated by the rapid rise of the x-ray yield as the microwave power was increased."
"In superconducting cavities in the GHz region several field-dependent effects have been observed. Besides qualitatively well-understood effects due to H2 such as radiation pressure or heating one encounters also strange effects which could be explained by pre-breakdown field emission or by high-order multipactoring. The presence of electrons limits the power fed into the cavity and may cause a strong inductive loading of the cavity, permitting a pulling of the oscillating frequency by more than 10 kHz above the smallfield resonant frequency. Since this phenomenon could seriously hamper a frequency-tuning servo-system, we carried out a detailed study on superconducting cavities, the results of which are presented in this paper."
"Measurements of the RF-residual surface resistance of superconducting niobium have been carried out between 2-4 GHz. The experiments show that also for type II superconductors like niobium the losses due to frozen-in magnetic flux can be described by Rres∝ψ2/3 (anomalous skin-effect). For negligible frozen-in flux the residual losses are proportional to ψ1.7±0.2 like in the case of lead, indicating that a general mechanism seems to be responsible for these residual losses. By electrochemical oxidation we have achieved fields up to 325 G in the TM011-mode."
"In the presence of high radiation pressure appropriate frequency feedback allows stable operation of a resonator at any operating point on the resonance curve. In addition, the electromagnetic forces can be used to damp mechanical oscillations caused by external forces."
  "Twenty-four low temperature measurements have been made on six different superconducting Nb cavities at 1300 NHz. These cavities were fabricated using Nb sheet and electron-beam welding and were processed using ultra-high-vacuum firing. Unloaded Q's as high as 4 × 109 and peak surface electric fields as high as 16 MV/m have been achieved."
"The program of measurements at SLAC on superconducting niobium cavities is described. Results for TE and TM mode X-band cavities are presented. An RF magnetic breakdown field of 960 gauss and Q values greater than 1011 were measured for an electron beam welded TE011 mode cavity at 10.5 GHz. The best result for a TM mode cavity was a Q of 1.4 × 109 and a breakdown field of 360 gauss, limited probably by the quality of the electron beam weld. Data on the effect of exposure to air and to nitrogen are presented."
 "The microwave system using feedback stabilization methods to control the phase and amplitude of various rf fields in the linac is described. Emphasis is given to the design of modular system components using microstrip transmission line techniques to permit integration of microwave and electronic circuits."
"The superconducting RF beam separator now being constructed at Karlsruhe requires two 3m-long niobium deflectors, which are capable of operating with an equivalent deflecting field of at least 2 MV/m corresponding to an RF peak field of about 250 G. At present, a series of uniform periodic n/2-mode structures are investigated to determine a suitable fabrication technique, but it is anticipated to build the final deflector with a bi-periodic π/2-mode structure. The problem of mechanical tolerances is analysed by means of equivalent circuits. Questions which arise in connection with the coupling system, frequency tuner, end cells, joints, and mode stabilizers are discussed. Measurements on a test structure yielded a residual quality factor of Q≃109 and a peak field of ≃200 G after firing the cavity at 1400°C in a vacuum furnace."
"We have conducted a number of tests on superconducting lead-plated cavities and superconducting lead-plated, iris-loaded deflecting structures. Our best result for the cavity has been a Q0 of 7.4 × 109 for the TE011 resonant mode at 2.856 GHz. For the iris-loaded structure we have achieved a Q0 of 2.2 × 108 at 1.8°K for the deflecting 27π/3 mode and an equivalent deflecting field of 500 kV/m."
"Recent studies of long-pulse separated beams indicate the need for the development of superconducting rf separators for counter experiments. To achieve this goal we investigated microwave resonators at S-band frequencies manufactured by the three following methods: 1) machining from solid electron-beam-melted niobium, 2) electroforming in molten fused salts by the Linde Company, 3) machining hydroformed cups of commercial grade niobium. Machined parts were electron-beam welded to form microwave cavities. All cavities were heat treated in either the Oak Ridge, Stanford or SLAC high-vacuum, high-temperature furnaces and chemically polished. We investigated and compared both surface resistance and peak rf magnetic field of the above cavities after every step. We measured an improvement factor of ~ 106 at Bˇ = 330 G in a TE011 cavity. The highest rf magnetic field achieved was 464 G in the TM010 mode which corresponds to Ê of ~17 MV/m. In addition, we were looking for peaks in the microwave absorbtion caused by rf magnetic field induced surface states similar to those reported by various researchers on highly polished crystals in low dc magnetic fields. No such anomalies were found."
"The present status of colliding beam devices is reviewed, and the limitations on their performance are discussed. Recent modifications to the design of the Stanford electron position storage ring are also discussed."
 "The CERN Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) produced the first proton-proton collisions at 15 GeV on January 27, 1971. These tests and other earlier ones with beam in only one ring are described. Further data and observations during the continuing running-in period are included."
"This paper presents the project of an electron pulse stretcher (E.P.S.) for the 100-300 MeV electron linear accelerator of the University of Saskatchewan. We briefly outline the results of a previous study made by the particle optics division (S.O.C.) of Saclay for the project ALIS and show its relation to our design. The present E.P.S. machine design and characteristics are discussed and finally some remarks are made on tolerances and vacuum requirements. More detailed information can be obtained in our internal reports."
"The paper presents the main ideas involved in the injection and extraction procedures for the electron pulse stretcher (E.P.S.) designed for the linear accelerator of the University of Saskatchewan. The E.P.S. is described in another paper presented at the conference (D-5). The interested reader can find more detailed information on injection and extraction in our internal reports."
 "In order to enhance the synchrotron radiation experimental program at the University of Wisconsin Physical Sciences Laboratory, a series of three magnets is being designed to be inserted in a long straight section of the 240 MeV electron storage ring. Two of these magnets (each with a 12.5 kG peak field for a 4° bend) will be inverted so as to deflect the equilibrium orbit 1 cm radially away from the ring center. The central magnet will have a maximum field of about 25 kG and will turn the beam through 8°. The synchrotron radiation power spectrum from this central high field magnet will peak at 40 Å. Using the Courant and Snyder formalism, tune shifts of Δνx = 0.028 and Δνz=0.024 have been calculated for an optimum design -- all magnets are to be wedge shaped for normal beam entry and exit at full excitation and each of the magnets will have a constant field gradient of n = 1/3. Stopband widths at nearby resonances have been calculated to be ⩽0.057 and are considered to be quite tolerable. Calculations have also been carried out to insure that the \"wavelength shifter\" does not adverseley affect the synchrotron radiation damping rates. For the optimum design, the maximum change to the damping rates will be less than 10%."
"Data on the first year of operation and on recent bunch length and luminosity measurements at the electron-positron 1.5 GeV/beam storage ring Adone are presented."
"We have developed a reliable procedure for multicycle filling of the Cambridge Electron Accelerator ring with positrons and electrons. The positron fill rate is determined by the intensity, spectrum, and emittance provided by the 125-MeV positron linac and also by the available phas-space and momentum acceptance aperture of the synchrotron for off-axis injection. This aperture in turn depends on the width of the already stored beam. Losses of newly injected particles in subsequent acceleration cycles depend on the extent of radiation damping provided by special damping magnets. After measuring and optimizing the main parameters, we have achieved a positron fill rate of 0. 4 mA peak per second. The control system used in rapid change over from 125-MeV positron injection to 250-MeV electron injection is sufficiently stable, automatic, and fast acting that filling the ring with countertraveling positron and electron beams takes less than five minutes."
 "A circuit producing a pulse of over 100 A and a width programmable from 2 to 16 ms has been developed to power a beam bump. The switching circuit involves two SCR's. The pulse width is controlled by changing the timing of the SCR triggers. An inductance is in series with the circuit, and additional diodes have been used to avoid any overshoot or undershoot during switching. The beam bump is part of the damping system used for accumulation and storage of electrons and positrons in the Cambridge Electron Accelerator ring. During multicycle filling, the beam bump backleg windings move the beams approximately 1.5 inches transversly into the damping magnets while the beam energy is near maximum. In order to store the particles at constant energy, the ac component of the synchrotron magnets excitation is decreased and the dc component increased. At the same time, the beam bump pulse is continuously increased in width and finally switched into a steady-state condition. The conversion process is completed with no loss in beam current."
"The AGS central RF power amplifier has logged over 6000 hours of accelerator service at normal beam energies, intensities, and duty cycle. The twelve orbital cavities are driven by remote ferrite-coupled final amplifier stages through long matched pairs of coaxial cables from a central RF building. The final stage inputs are paralleled in groups of six for energizing by a pair of identical drivers which, in turn, are parallel-excited from a smaller predriver. There are no tuned stages. Wide-band coupling is achieved throughout the amplifier with ferrite networks. A common dc anode rectifier in the same building powers the driver and final stages. Cavity tuning and AGC loop commands are generated at the output terminals of the final stages. The design, construction, and performance of the new amplifier are discussed."
"In each of the four rings the acceleration will be provided by a single RF cavity consisting of two ferrite-loaded quarter-wave coaxial lines. The four cavities are superposed in the same straight section in order to save space for future developments, and are thus severely limited in height (< 360 mm). To help ensure high reliability, and ease of cavity replacement, forced air cooling was chosen. Ferrite biasing is achieved by means of two figure-of-eight loops. The final stage of the RF amplifier is located at the cavity while the driver and preamplifier stages are centralised. Special problems encountered are reported and the adopted solutions described."
 "Performance requirements and accelerating cavity description for the NAL Main Ring Synchrotron are presented. Results of tests on early production models are reported."
"Investigations at NAL on ferrite disclosed a time dependent RF loss phenomenon occuring only at high power. Ferrite toroids of two manufacturers were tested to obtain enough cores of adequate power-handling capability for both the Booster and Main Accelerator cavities. The central portion of the test apparatus was a half wave coaxial cavity impedance matched to a 5kW power amplifier. The core selection criteria for Booster and Main Accelerator tuners differed and is discussed. Tuners assembled with the selected cores have operated satisfactorily at R. F. levels above 1OOkVA per core."
"A 100 kW RF power amplifier is described which will power the RF cavities in both the booster accelerator and the main accelerator of the NAL proton synchrotron."
"A bar loaded or jungle gym waveguide for accelerator service is discussed. The results of measurements are given and a high power prototype model is described. Results show that this type of structure is unsuitable for superconducting applications."
"The RF accelerating cavity for the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) injector booster utilizes a single gap and is filled with ferrite to allow permeability tuning."
  "A six cavity, 1¼ MW, 805 MHz klystron for the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) has been designed at Los Alamos and fabricated at Litton Industries. The design requirements were all exceeded by the experimental tube and a maximum dc to rf conversion efficiency of 57.4% was measured. The design and performance of the klystron is discussed in this paper."
"The application of a ferrite with strong dispersion of magnetic loss tangent to control the impedance of undesired modes in the main ring cavities of the National Accelerator Laboratory synchrotron is described. The impedances of 17 of 21 modes in the frequency range of interest have been damped to less than 0.5 percent of the main mode impedance. On the basis of low level measurements, the dissipation added due to mode damping is 2 kW for operation at a 200 kV gap voltage."
"After 20 years of operation as a conventional synchrocyclotron producing 0.4 μA time average internal beam current of protons (increased to 1.6 μA in 1967) of ~ 385 MeV, we stopped operation in September 1970 for the major modification for which we have been planning since 1965. The major study program and the conversion project are supported by a $ 3.9 M grant from the NSF. The conversion retains the basic cyclotron magnet (2000 tons of Fe and ~ 300 tons of Cu coils), but adds a 10-in. thick Fe band around the outside magnet perimeter to lower the return path reluctance. A new larger vacuum chamber is used, with auxilliary excitation coils. Pole iron within 30 in. of the median plane is replaced by a new configuration which includes N=3 symmetry sector iron with a small median plane gap.  = 18 kG near the center and 20 kG near 80 in. radius. Strong azimuthal magnetic field flutter begins at < 2 in. radius to give strong focusing νz, and νr∦1. We expect to obtain ~ 550 MeV proton energy, with high extraction efficiency for a 10 to 40 μA time average external beam (~ 50% duty factor), when operation starts later this year. Additional details are given in companion papers in these Proceedings. The system will still be a synchrocyclotron and will have a 300 Hz FM repetition rate, with a new RF system, etc."
"The University of Maryland Cyclotron has been available for use by experimentalists since summer, 1970. This paper includes a brief description of the main features of the cyclotron and of the facilities currently available for experiments. (For detailed descriptions see references 1-4.) Operation of the cyclotron is discussed and the results of a few tests on the external beam are presented. Finally, data obtained from three experiments is presented to demonstrate the over-all energy resolution available for a given experimental setup."
 "A detailed study of a separated-magnet two-stage cyclotron has been made. For elements heavier than S, ions are preaccelerated by a 700 keV Cockroft-Walton and then injected into the first stage (lower gap) of the cyclotron. After acceleration, extraction and stripping (from charge Q to 4Q) they are returned to the center of the second stage (upper gap, whose center line is 15 inches above that of the lower gap) and further accelerated. For ions lighter than S, preacceleration takes place in a small cyclotron and the ions are injected directly into the second stage of the large cyclotron. Protons may be accelerated from 4 to 200 MeV, 3He from 12 to 630 MeV and U from 620 to 2130 MeV. The magnitude of external beams of heavy ions is limited by heating and sputtering of the electrostatic deflector extraction system. The turn separation for uranium ions at the final radius is 16 mm, so extraction efficiencies above 90% should be possible. At 90% it is estimated that 1 particle microampere of uranium ions will be obtained."
"Orbit dynamics in the central region have been studied with the aim of optimizing the design for beam quality and RF phase acceptance. Axial ion motion near the centre is dominated by the strong phase dependent RF electric forces at the dee gaps; the consequent restriction of the phase acceptance to ions lagging the RF voltage peak can be lifted both by using an asymmetric dee gap geometry and by the addition of third harmonic to the RF fundamental. A transition from six- to three-sector magnet geometry at the centre to increase the axial focusing was also tried, but was found to give rise to unacceptable ±9° phase oscillations if the dee gap were oriented to avoid the usual gap crossing resonance. Other effects producing coherent radial oscillations, such as first harmonic magnetic field components and dee-voltage asymmetries, have been assigned tight tolerances. The proposed design also makes possible near perfect centring for ions of all phases. Numerical orbit tracking has shown that a beam with the emittance of the external ion source can be accelerated to 20 MeV within 0.25 π in. mrad for an RF phase band at least 25° wide: in the absence of inflationary effects at higher energies this would yield a 500 MeV beam with ±600 keV energy resolution."
"This paper is a report of some studies made of orbit properties in the TRIUMF Cyclotron. We will describe a numerical technique for obtaining solutions of ill-conditioned linear equations, this has proved useful when trying to produce a desired field with 54 trim coil pairs using the method of least squares, and in calculating an isochronous field. We will also describe a phase dependent centring error which can distort the horizontal emittance of beams with positive phases, thus limiting the phase acceptance of a cyclotron; and tolerances for field imperfections imposed by certain resonances in TRIUMF will also be reported. These calculations are chiefly concerned with phenomena away from the immediate central region and consequently electric focusing forces have been ignored. Central region calculations that include electric fields will be reported elsewhere."
"The focusing properties of cyclotron-type electric lenses with time-varying potentials were investigated by analytical and numerical methods. First-order focusing formulas were derived which include the effects of \"liner\" and of focusing grids. The main emphasis of the numerical studies was on the aspects of lens effects which had not been previously investigated: (a) The behavior of the lenses at large transit times or rf frequencies for which the approximations of analytical theory are not valid. (b) The effects of posts (or grids) placed at one or both sides of the gap. The lens parameters, i.e. focal lengths and location of principal planes, were computed numerically for several geometries using electric field data obtained by computer with relaxation method. Computations were carried out for several two-dimensional and three-dimensional gap geometries at three different frequencies of the gap voltage as a function of kinetic energy and rf phase of the particles at the center of the gap. A criterion for the validity of first-order theory was established. The application to cyclotrons is discussed briefly."
"These studies show: 1) that with reasonable modifications to the panels in the RF cavity and the addition of a driven RF oscillator TAMVEC's maximum proton energy can be increased from 50 MeV to 70 MeV, 2) that re-wiring the trim and valley coils external to the cyclotron would facilitate increasing the maximum deuteron energy from 60 MeV to 70 MeV and, 3) that combining the above two modifications would further increase the proton energy to 80 MeV."
"Since initial operation of the Texas A&M Variable Energy Cyclotron, several modifications have been made to improve beam quality and operating characteristics. Much of the effort has been in the area of beam diagnostics with several improvements resulting from this work. The following describes a portion of the work done and discusses some of the more important areas of improvement."
"The <B> for the revised Nevis Synchrocylotron magnet will increase from 18 kG at the center to 20 kG at 80 in. radius. This gives 27.48 MHz at injection, and 19.23 MHz for extraction (550 MeV, 76 in. radius). The resonator will be tuned so that fmin = fextraction including a slow RF turnoff where df/dt ≈ 0 for adiabatic energy damping. The peak dee voltage ≥ 30 kV with the maximum near injection. The repetition rate will be 300 Hz with <50% RF duty factor. The single dee and dee stem structure will be ~ 150 in. wide and 163 in. long. One of the three pairs of sector-iron shims is to be incorporated into the dee and the assembly supported on cooled alumina structural insulators. The resonator frequency is varied by two rotating capacitors located at the end of the dee stem, which is split outside the magnet circle. Excitation of the resonator will be provided by a grounded-grid, triode oscillator having the anode and cathode coupled to the resonator via coupling loops and transmission lines of proper length and impedance. A series tube modulator will permit the slow linear RF turnoff needed for adiabatic energy damping of the phase oscillations before extraction."
  "The single parts of the resonator are represented from the rf point of view. Some of the methods of the rf design are discussed: 1. The calculation of the Dee as an inhomogeneous line and as a plane network of capacities and inductivities. 2. A general computer program (UNIV) which calculates series connections of four-terminal networks. This was used for the design of the complete rf system."
"The isochronous cyclotron at the BONN university is a multi particle variable energy machine. Its basic design is very similar to the Jülich Cyclotron. The relatively low maximum energy of approx. 30 MeV deuterons and the high energy gain per turn of 220 keV results in a large turn separation of 3 mm at the extraction radius. The machine operates in the single turn extraction mode as well as in the multi turn extraction mode."
"The Karlsruhe cyclotron is in operation since 1963. In the meantime, a polarized deuteron source has been developed by a group of GFK Karlsruhe. To operate the cyclotron with polarized ions an axial injection system has been ordered at AEG, associated with the construction of a new RF-system. During a shut-down period of three months the complete new system will be taken in operation in this summer. The system has to operate with an external source as well as with an internal source. The central region and the axial beam line have been calculated to have a full transmittance for a phase space area of 500 mm mrad in both directions and a phase width of 30° (related to the RF) in the 3#x003C9;-mode."
"A current channel has been designed (computer) with a total septum thickness including supports of 0.150 in. It provides a field jump of over 6 kG and a gradient of over 1.5 kG/in. The direction of the gradient is such that the channel field superimposed on the fringing field of the cyclotron magnet produces a radially focusing field. The heat load and the power dissipation in the septum will be greatly reduced by having the septum flare out from 0.125 in. at the upstream end of the channel to about 0.600 in. at the downstream end. This reduces the power consumption in the septum to 40 kW."
"It is shown that particles filling an RF bucket in a synchrocyclotron can be stacked with a minimum energy spread if the acceleration voltage and frequency are suitably matched. Beam stretching systems of accelerative and non-accelerative type are examined and their performance with regard to duty-cycles, efficiencies and energy resolution is compared."
"The four-meter isochronous cyclotron at JINR is being constructed for accelerating intense beams of heavy ions with A/Z ratio of 3.5 to 25 proton units and a smoothly variable energy within the range of 400-625 Z2/A MeV. Basic physical parameters and ideas of this accelerator are presented."
"The use of an on-line computer to expedite accelerator studies may be one of its most important applications. This report is a discussion of some of the types of problems for which computer assistance is of value and describes some implications on the configuration."
  "The control environment of the Bevatron is divided into a system of well-defined tasks, each capable of being treated individually but not separately. To maintain the individual aspect, but integrate all of the component tasks into a system structure, ours is the \"multi-processor\" concept of system organization. It was recognized that bulk-storage elements could not be provided separately for each processor, and in fact, advantage could be gained by utilizing the moderate speed disc-storage as a common-memory element thereby allowing the main-frame memory of each mini-computer to act as \"cache\" memory for each arm of the quasi-multiprocessor. This allows the use of overlay techniques to provide an apparent vastly expanded software capability."
  "The panelists made short oral presentations, based on the prepared remarks included below, describing the systems they use and the ways the configurations were determined by the particular requirements at each laboratory. Most of the session was an informal discussion, roughly organized about system configuration, reliability, closed-loop control and software. The session was closed with Madsen's discussion relating computer control to accelerator physics, from his prepared statement."
 "A description of all beam diagnostics equipment for the CERN PS Booster is given. The following items are discussed in more detail: -a computerized system of position pick-up electrodes, -a 900 MHz electromagnetic pick-up station, -the fast measurement of the betatron-tune and -the measurement line for the ejected beams (spectrometry and emittance measurements)."
"The purpose of the CPS booster (PSB) and the characteristics of its RF system are discussed elsewhere. Because of the tight tolerances on longitudinal beam dilution each ring of the PSB is provided with an independent beam control. Among the different possible solutions we chose a phase-lock that includes the accelerating cavity in the loop (Fig. 1), as used in the CPS. This system provides a rapid correction of any non adiabatic error (induced in the electronics). The static and low frequency errors (such as those arising from errors in the magnetic field) of the phase lock are corrected by a beam radial position servo. At full energy the bunches of the four rings are synchronized in phase for injection into the CPS. For this the magnetic guide fields of the four rings will be made equal to within ΔB/B = ± 2 × 10-4 , which corresponds to an energy error of ± 50 keV and a longitudinal dilution in the CPS of about 10%. The whole system is described and performance figures given."
"The four-ring 800 MeV CERN PS Booster (PSB), whose running-in is scheduled for spring 1972, is to provide 1013 protons per pulse with a high phase space density. The control and data acquisition of the four PSB rings are largely independent of each other, although their operation is to be synchronized with the 50 MeV linac (which serves as an injector) and the CPS (into which the PSB beam is transferred). Many of the control and measurement tasks will be performed with the aid of a computer which is shared with the linac and the CPS. The selection of a central computer operating with the Multiprogramming Operating Executive System (MPX) was made as an optimum compromise between efficiency and economy (e.g. sharing of existing facilities). A large number of analog functions will be generated via a small digital computer, connected to the main computer. This system is discussed in detail and the application programs listed."
"In a first step to automate the beam handling control at the Jülich Isochronous Cyclotron electronical equipment in integratedcircuit-TTL technique bas been designed and tested. The system allows to automaticly activate all beam handling components according to a preselected beam path. In a second step of automation a link to a PDP-15 computer will be provided."
"The computer control system for the K9 separated beam is described. This beamline is a multi-energy/ multi-particle beam and the principal aim of the computer system is to reduce the time taken to tune the beam to a new energy. The hardware comprises a 12K PDP-8 with disc and magnetic tape, a Teletype and logging typewriter. Control of the magnet currents and collimators is via a multi-crate CAMAC system, which also serves for data acquisition. The software system is based on a real-time, high level language interpreter. Besides allowing the users to write their programs in a high level language (similar to FORTRAN), the interpreter also provides all the executive functions required with a disc-based, real-time system. Because an interpreter is used, programs can be written or modified on-line and tried out immediately. The relatively slow execution speed of the interpreter is no disadvantage. The system allows high level language and machine code program segments to be combined in any program."
"A survey of the existing (and planned) particle accelerators throughout North America and Europe will immediately indicate the unmistakable proliferation of either partial, or total, digital computer control systems. The cybernetic-like tentacles of these systems have reached into the most remote areas of the particle accelerator. One also realizes that each facility has designed special hardware, unlike any other, to handle the interface problem between the accelerator and the computer. A further look will convince one that the various interface problems are not, in principle, different. This paper will discuss a practical solution to the standard interface concept for computer control systems. Such an accelerator/computer-independent scheme for interface could well save many man-years of redundant design effort and invoke considerable cost savings in system implementation. A system organized about the dataway and branch/control highway of the CAMAC standard is a potential contender."
"A solid-state step-start contactor using back-to-back thyristors has been developed at NAL. The unit described here employs water-cooled thyristors designed to switch 3 phase 500A rms at 480V, 60 Hz. The thyristors are turned on by a rectified 50 kHz carrier signal transmitted to the thyristor gate circuit via a specially developed high-isolation transformer that prevents the impulse noise on the 480V line from affecting the logic-level control circuits. A 3-phase current sensor and a solid-state interlock and status-monitor display unit form an integral part of the contactor. DTL compatible logic-level signals are used to control the contactor from local or remote positions and to display and monitor the status of the interlocked variables. These principles appear to be quite applicable to contactors designed for lower or higher power levels."
"The Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) beam inhibit system provides a very rapid means of turning off the accelerator beam in the event of a spill. The maximum time required to turn off is approximately 9 μs, of which 5 μs are due to transmission line delay. The beam inhibit system (and the beam spill detectors) is distributed along the entire length of the accelerator. The system has been operating successfully for more than eight months in the portion of the accelerator that is in use."
"The instrument presented utilizes an oscilloscope, television camera and control logic to digitize high speed transient or repetitive waveforms displayed on the CRT of an oscilloscope. It allows visual study of signals which would normally be degraded by the cabling used to carry the signal from the source to a remote oscilloscope. The instrument is placed near the source where digital conversion of the waveform takes place. The digital data is stored in local memory and is transmitted to a computer for manipulation and presentation. This allows long term study of transient waveforms. The unit extends the analog to digital conversion speed to 20 samples in 20 ns. Assuming 5 samples per cycle, this would correspond to digitizing transients in the 200 MHz frequency range."
 "An on-line computer system is being used to monitor and control various devices. Progress has been continual although slow at times. Our primary difficulties have been in interfacing to a variety of devices which were brought into existence without thought of digital control or monitoring. Efficient use of a computer clearly requires considerable preplanning of the hardware that is to be attached and a thorough understanding of the operation of the hardware in order to implement useful software. One should expect to expend considerable programming effort."
"High precision, four-terminal resistors (shunts) of coaxial design have been developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) for measuring and controlling constant or pulsed magnet currents. Air or water-cooled shunts for currents between 50 A and 10 kA have been built. Their frequency response ranges from dc to tens of kilohertz, and their resistance is reproducible within ±0. 001%. The resistance-stress coefficient of shunt-manganin was determined for compressive stresses applied transverse to the direction of current flow."
"The system described calculates both horizontal and vertical beam size and center position at each experimenter's target. The measuring devices are of the nondestructive multiple-wire type. The necessary multiplexing and synchronized sampling of the devices are controlled by the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) control computer. As soon as the data are available, a program is called upon to calculate the beam center position and full width at half maximum (FWHM). As these values are calculated, they are formatted and multiplexed to displays for the ZGS operators and to the experimenters' location. The system processes up to eight profile devices and supplies results on a pulse-to-pulse basis immediately after the beam spill time."
"A monitoring system has been developed for measuring the torsional strains and torsional vibrations produced in the motor-generator shaft by the pulsed operation of the ring magnet of the ZGS. The detection of these vibrations makes it possible to readjust the ring magnet cycle to prolong the life of the shaft. The monitoring system uses stainless steel bands mounted on the shaft. These bands contain engraved markings that are sensed by the optical system that controls the digital electronics. The system makes over 800 digital measurements of strain during each revolution of the generator shaft. Alarms and shutdown circuits are activated if the strain exceeds a safe limit. A digital-to-analog (d-to-a) converter produces an output for displaying strain and vibrations on a conventional oscilloscope."
"An instrument has been developed to measure betatron tunes with a minimum of disturbance to normal operation. In one mode of operation, the beam is driven by a frequency sweeping voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The output of this VCO is compared to (1-ν) feedback from the beam in a phase-sensitive demodulator. The dc output of this demodulator helps to control the frequency of the VCO, thus closing a loop around the beam. At frequency coincidence between the (1-ν) feedback and the VCO, a pulse is generated which stops the VCO frequency sweep and allows phase lock on the beam if desired. This pulse also activates measuring and digitizing circuitry to record pertinent data at the instant of frequency coincidence. Other modes of operation permit measurement of, and phase lock to, unexcited or \"natural\" resonances."
 "The LASL Van de Graaff Facility includes two accelerators, an 8 MeV vertical and a 16 MeV tandem. Subsystems are being monitored and controlled by a Honeywell H610 process control computer. To improve the man/computer/accelerator communication an Adage AGT-10 graphics system was obtained. Presently the AGT-10 is connected to the H610 and a XDS-930 computer used for data acquisition. Control and monitoring functions have been implemented using the graphics system. It has proved particularly valuable in the optimization problem where many variables may be changed simultaneously. Multi-parameter optimization algorithms suitable for nonlinear objective functions with constraints are being tested on the tandem. Ones which have large tolerance to variations in the measured quantities and fast convergence are being sought. Results to date are given."
"Control of the Bevatron acceleration system had been entirely analogue until developments in proton extraction techniques required substantial reduction of hum and noise during the acceleration cycle. The decision was made to employ a digital processor to control the acceleration cycle. An algorithm is developed which allows introduction of radial-feedback data into the digital processor and the real-time error signal is combined with arbitrary field dependent functions for transmission to the existing master. oscillator. A high common-mode rejection digital system is utilized to enter the resultant control data directly into the master-oscillator environment before conversion into the required analog reference for frequency modulation. A comprehensive hardware \"calculator\" provides a continuous curve of digital representations to be sent along to the oscillator. The paper describes implementation of these facilities and the development of operator-oriented interface to capitalize upon the flexibilities inherent within a digitally oriented system."
"The Bevatron guide field power supply has been under computer control for one year. This facility allows operational parameters to be programmed at operator request in order to provide the desired field profiles commensurate with the current experimental program. With a requirement of one part in fifteen thousand accuracy for resonant extraction, the digital system has been enlarged until a realtime closed-loop control function meet this specification. A one gauss window for entry into flat-zones is now maintained, while a relative flatness tolerance of ±1/ 2 gauss is held during the typical 2-sec. flatzone. This paper includes the structure of a new data-acquisition system with emphasis upon the use of a fast magnetic-core memory to gather blocks of data, as well as to hold the necessary digital threshold values to be arithmetically compared with the results of the data gathering facility. Also covered, is the implementation of the system in the detection and ultimate reduction of incipient fault conditions within the guide field power supply."
"SLAC is consolidating its two control rooms by utilizing existing control computers in each, connected by a communications link. Except for video signals, all of the controls and data of one (Central Control Room) will be sent to the operators in the other (beam switchyard control room) using this system. The paper is concerned with the software aspects of this project. The major program components are described."
 "A multi-programming system has been written to schedule the various application programs and to exploit the hardware attached to the CERN ISR control computer system. This paper describes certain features of the system, in particular those that concern its operation, as well as a synopsis of the applications."
"Consolidation of two large accelerator control rooms using digital computers connected by a data link is described. Several consolidation plans are discussed and the adopted solution is described. The key elements are touch panels operating with a TV display system."
"An interface design is proposed for tie-in between a master computer and a slave computer for transferring of data and control signals between the 200 MeV Linear Accelerator and a master computer station. Report discusses device control, device selection and control for a party line I/O bus, sensing techniques, and graphic display simulation."
"A control panel of novel design has been developed at SLAC. This panel, called a touch panel, consists of a glass plate placed in front of a computer driven cathode ray tube display. Ultrasonic surface (Rayleigh) wave (8.5 MHz) beams are transmitted in a crossing X-Y grid through the glass. The intersection points of the beams form the \"buttons\" on the panel. The computer furnishes legends for these buttons. The presence of an operator's finger on the glass \"pushing\" a button is detected by the absorption of an X and a Y beam. A prototype panel has been built and used successfully with an SDS-925 computer for magnet control in the SLAC beam switchyard. A second generation panel with low parallax using the glass face of the CRT itself as the medium for ultrasonic propagation has been designed and is being constructed. An extensive software system, utilizing numerous \"software panels\", for general control of the accelerator, the beam switchyard, and their associated subsystems is being developed. The physical principles of the device, its advantages and disadvantages over conventional devices, current hardware and software implementation, and future plans are discussed."
"Remote control and data acquisition on a single or at most several wires has been under study at the AGS for some time. Recent advances in integrated circuit technology and significant reductions in the cost of Analog/Digital and Digital/Analog converters has enabled us to design a control system far cheaper (per channel) than similar automatic control schemes and which appears when all costs are included (wire, installation, etc.) to be competitive with conventional manual multiwire systems. The system is based upon the premise that the attached computer does not have to function in order for the control system to operate, but we have rejected the notion that duplicate (computer and manual) controls be developed. The new system might be likened to replacing switches with relays. The relays added additional reliability problems to the system, but their presence permitted control sequences unattainable with practical switch arrays, as well as operation with fewer personnel. The integrated circuit, serial, time multiplex system is the next evolutionary step."
"The control system for the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) accelerator is organized around an on-line digital computer. The computer's versatility in acquiring and arranging data for presentation to the operator made a strong impact on the design of the operator's console and the central control room. The racks full of lights, meters, and knobs so typical of a conventional control system were replaced at LAMPF by a compact console in which the prominent device is a graphic display scope with a light pen. This paper traces the evolution of the present LAMPF operator's console. The experience gained from a prototype console for a small accelerator is recounted. It was on this console that the concept of graphic control panels was pioneered. The considerations which led to the physical shape of the LAMPF console are explained and a description is given of the various panels. The console was put into operation in December 1970."
"The CEA colliding beam project requires trigger signals relative to the e- and e+ circumferential beam positions in the accelerator. These triggers are required for proper timing of multicycle injection, steering of the beam into the bypass, triggering of beam monitoring and excitation devices. The synchronizer was built to provide these triggers."
"This paper describes the central control system now being built and used to operate the completed parts of the NAL accelerator. This control system may be of some interest because new methods of monitoring and control are made necessary by the greatly increased size and complexity of the NAL accelerator compared with other synchrotrons. The primary design goal for the NAL control system is that eventually, during routine operation, one person be able to operate the entire accelerator: preaccelerator, linear accelerator, booster synchrotron, main synchrotron and beam-extraction and transport systems. But it is also necessary that several operators be able simultaneously to interrogate and control different parts of the accelerator for maintenance, diagnosis of equipment problems, bringing new devices on, and for accelerator-development studies. To attain these goals, a computer-assisted system has been designed and is being built. This system has several levels of organization, and it is desirable that control be possible at more than one level, in order to avoid shutdowns caused by higher-level equipment failures. The system must also be flexible enough to accommodate the new devices we expect will be added as the accelerator is developed. This paper includes an overall description of the control system, and details of some of its special features."
"The Booster and Main Accelerator RF Systems at NAL share many common devices and have nearly identical control requirements. The equipment for each cavity is controlled and monitored via a Module Interface Unit (MIU). The MIU's, connected to a MAC-16 computer via a 50 ohm parallel daisy chain cable system, serve the dual functions of interfacing the equipment to the computer and of providing facilities for manual control and monitoring of an accelerating module. The MIU is a general interface having the capacity to control 32 and monitor 128 binary lines, control 16 analog channels, and monitor 64 analog channels via an attached Multiplexed A/D Converter (MADC). The assignment of channels to equipment functions may be easily changed at each module. Each of three RF control centers contains a MAC-16 computer, an MIU and MADC for control of non-modular equipment, a timing controller to provide computer-controlled timing signals, and a computer-independent core memory curve generator providing repetitive driving waveforms. Each MAC-16 may be controlled locally using a portable I/O cart containing a teletype, paper tape reader, and control knobs, or from the main control room consoles via serial data links to a Sigma 2 computer."
"The control system for the NAL Main Accelerator Ring is based on a distributed multiplex technique which uses serial transmission of digital data to link 24 service buildings to a central computer system. Each service building contains logic for conversion of serial data to parallel format and parallel to serial. Data transmission cables form a large loop that extends around the four mile circumference of the accelerator so that data transmitted from a central communications controller goes to each service building sequentially and is then returned to the central controller. The communications controller is an integral part of the interface electronics for a MAC-16 minicomputer which serves as a real-time controller for ring subsystems. The MAC-16 is connected to control console electronics and to a second minicomputer used for Main Ring power supply fine control. In the near future, the MAC-16 will be linked to an XDS Sigma II computer that serves as a central controller for the entire complex."
"High spatial and time resolution multiwire proportional chambers and a readout system has been developed. These chambers will be used at the secondary beam lines of NAL. Spatial resolution of ±0.25mm and time resolution of 16nsec at FWHM obtained from 0.5mm wire spaced chambers."
"Pulsed electron beams are formed by the slow charge of a pulse forming network (microseconds to D. C.) and the fast discharge (10 - 100 ns) onto a field emission diode. The resultant beams of kiloamps to megamps at hundreds of keV to ten MeV are passed through a window into the drift region. Ionization in the drift section allows the beam to be confined by its own magnetic field. Secondary electron currents in the plasma tend to neutralize this effect, Recent work on guiding intense beams with auxiliary fields has utilized applied Bz and Bθ (z-pinch) fields. Application of these beams extends from shock studies to ion acceleration."
"The principles and designs of transformer accelerators (TA) generating intense beams of charged particles over energy ranges 0.5-5 Mev are described. Pulse electron accelerators with pulse length of 10-8 to 10-5sec are investigated (some of them have a repetition rate of several hundreds pps) as well as one-phase d three-phase 50-cps transformers. The most models' power conversion efficiency is in the range of 60-95%, the averaged beam power comes up to or exceeds 10 kW and is in excess of 150 kW for one of the last models. The design of a 5 Mev single-pulse TA with peak current of 30 kA at pulse length of 40 nsec and of 1.2 Mev proton TA with average beam power of 10 kW are described. The features of main components of high voltage transformers and of intense current acceleration tubes are discussed."
"The scope and status of the Berkeley Electron Ring Accelerator (ERA) program are reviewed."
"The ERA scheme being studied at the University of Maryland with collaboration of NRL and NBS involves the formation of the electron ring in a static rather than pulsed magnetic field. The main technical features, present status of the project and future plans are reviewed. Preliminary experimental studies with a 2 MeV injector are being carried out at NBS. A 5-MeV injector will be built by NRL. Extensive theoretical investigations have been carried out and design work for the compressor and expansion-acceleration system is in progress."
"A coaxial high current electron beam accelerator design is discussed. A novel feature of this design is that approximately one-half of the required energy is initially stored capacitively in a volume inside the beam. The cylindrical beam is accelerated with a Marx-like circuit. After acceleration, the beam is focused between coaxial biconic conductors to a small cross section. The design incorporates features which have been discussed by others. A specific accelerator module design storing 70 kilojoules and capable of producing beam currents greater than a million amperes at 1 million volts is described. The principal advantage of this design is that its compact size will make possible multi-module machines which will have an output far exceeding anything thought practical today."
"The electron beams from a Febetron 705 with two modified diodes have been studied. Both diodes gave hollow cylindrical beams with more than 4 × 1013 electrons within ~3% of the maximum beam energy and within 10 ns. The conventional two-dimensional emittance for 90% of the beam was measured to be 0.13 ( π cm rad.). The four-dimensional phase space projected into r-r' gives an emittance of 0.15 cm rad. Emittance values for various fractions of the beam are also given."
"In connection with the University of Maryland electron ring accelerator project, possibilities of forming the electron ring in a cusped magnetic field were investigated. The results of numerical calculations as well as analytic theory are presented. In order to reduce ripples in cylindrically rotating beams, and maximum phase space acceptance, a special way of winding coils and use of ferro-magnetic material is proposed."
 "A pulsed electron accelerator has been constructed and is now in operation at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley. It was designed specifically for and is used as an injector for ERA (electron ring accelerator) studies. Electron bursts of 1200 amperes and 40 nanoseconds duration can be produced at energies of 1.0 MeV to 4.25 MeV. The present repetition rate is approximately one per second. Acceleration is accomplished by means of ferrite loaded accelerating sections, each of which is capable of maintaining a 250 kV voltage pulse across the accelerating gap for a period of 40 ns. The voltage pulse has a rise time of 12 ns and the total timing jitter is of the order of one nanosecond. Five sections stacked together and operated as a unit function as the electron gun. The gun employs a field emission cathode and is operated at approximately 1 MV. Additional acceleration is achieved by means of an iterated system of accelerator sections and solenoidal magnetic lenses."
"Results of the first study of the conceptual design of a collective-effect proton accelerator of substantial energy (65-100 GeV) are described. Basic theoretical considerations are outlined and components and their arrangement for a conceptual accelerator are discussed. This first study shows that the promise of ERA principle to produce remarkably compact accelerators can be achieved by use of single-pulse surge-excited acceleration cavities. The example single-pass machine provides accelerating gradients of 250 MeV/meter overall where conventional synchrotrons yield 4o-80 MeV/ meter. The relaxed tolerances of the surge-excited cavities and their associated components allow great advantage to be taken of mass-production techniques with ensuing low cost (≲ M$ 0.24/GeV)."
"The technology of electron-ring compressors draws more heavily on controlled thermonuclear research than on conventional accelerators. This is dictated by the rapidly rising, intense magnetic fields (> 50 kG in < 1 ms), the required ultrahigh vacuum (≈10-9 torr), and the need for extensive diagnostics and instrumentation during the development phase. Interesting mechanical features of the Berkeley Compressor 3, Compressor 4, and Compressor 5 electron-ring research apparatus are described, including ceramic chamber design, ceramic-metal and ceramic-ceramic joining techniques, cryopumping, vacuum bakeout practices, and novel diagnostic probes suitable for ultrahigh vacuum service."
"A review is given of a simple and economical method of generating high current electron beams in the range of a few hundred kiloamperes to multi-megamperes at voltages of from 100 kV to 1 MV. Mylar dielectric parallel plate transmission lines, switched with either solid dielectric spark gaps or gas spark gaps constitute the pulse forming network. Several such generators have been built that feed a 50 nsec width pulse through a low inductance insulator/vacuum interface to a field emission diode. The electron beam is generated in the diode region and accelerated through a thin window into a drift chamber. One such generator is described in detail."
"A 250 - 400 kV, 80 kA, 30 ns electron beam generator has been developed. The machine consists of a 600 kV Marx generator, a water-dielectric transmission line, a diode, and a beam drift chamber. It was necessary to minimize prepulse for stable diode operation. Several cathodes were tested during development and results are reported. Diodes with 26 and 8 nH inductance are described."
  "In the initial electron-ring experiments with a new high-current, 2 MeV electron injector an efficient method of trapping of the injected beam was developed, and a suitable compression cycle was found in which betatron amplitude growth on single-particle resonances is negligible. The ring behavior is satisfactory during the compression cycle at low intensity (Ne < 5 × lO11). At higher intensities the lowest mode of the coherent radial instability appeared, but the threshold for its onset was raised considerably by increasing the Landau damping coefficient, so that it is no longer the limiting instability. At intensities Ne > 1012 electrons a longitudinal (negative mass) instability causes particle loss and radial spreading of the electron rings. Increasing the energy spread in the beam has raised the threshold for several phenomena observed in connection with this instability. The effects of changing the electromagnetic environment of the electron rings to suppress this instability are being investigated."
  "Most major features of the AGS Conversion Project are at or near completion. The entire Project should be completed within a year. The 200-MeV linac injector has accelerated beam to full energy and is undergoing detailed tune-up. The AGS main ring rf amplifier system has been running for a year. The new main magnet power supply has recently come into operation resulting in increased repetition rate and longer flat top for the AGS. Other features are well advanced."
"The first three months of operation of the NAL linac after first achieving a 200-MeV beam have been encouraging. The design performance has been achieved at beam intensities of about 20 mA both in the transverse emittance and the momentum spread. Attempts have not been made to go to intensities of 100 mA or greater as yet, and it will be interesting to see how the beam quality is affected by intensity. It is expected that when the linac rf phase and amplitude controls are properly working, the beam quality will be less than the design values. In particular, the momentum spread at the present operating currents is sufficiently small so that a debunching cavity currently is not envisioned. The beam measurements made so far confirm the theoretical results obtained with the PARMILA dynamics program. The particle distributions used in the program are those measured at the entrance to the linac. The large number of components in the systems have lead to concern over the reliability of the linac. The performance over the last three months has dispelled some of this concern. As running periods have increased the failure rate has decreased. Only two major problems stand out at this time. The first is the failure of the spring contacts on the filament leads to the power amplifier tubes. Installation care and the elimination of two of the contact rings which were not water-cooled seem to be providing at least a temporary solution."
"The use of low gun voltages for linac injection is, in general, impractical because the capture, or trapping, fraction of injected electrons is slight unless other especial devices are employed. For example, single gap cavities have been used as pre-accelerators, rather than velocity modulation prebunchers. Ordinarily a tapered phase velocity structure suggests itself; however, at very low voltages a reasonable disc thickness excludes any volume for the cavity. This report describes a novel use of a constant phase velocity periodic structure to capture and bunch a low voltage beam which is currently being used in low energy accelerators. A proposed additional use of this scheme is for obtaining very short pulses. Normally, high voltage diode guns have a perveance considerably lower than low voltage guns, requiring, therefore, a short high voltage pulse which is difficult to achieve owing to rise and fall time. It is suggested that the trapping scheme described above, using an achievable short pulse and low voltage gun will provide short beam pulses."
"The theory of particle bunch formation by means of velocity modulation, produced by single gap cavities, is customarily based on a ballistic analysis. Owing to the ready availability of computers, it is convenient to investigate velocity modulation including space charge forces using relativistic kinematics. This report presents the results of a systematic examination of bunching parameters."
 "The 10C MeV electron accelerator and facility, at Livermore have been designed for undertaking investigations in neutron physics and nuclear photoreactions. This has required versatility in the performance of the accelerator and in the layout of the beam transport system. The accelerator is a 5-section S-band device with bearm. pulse capability of 5ns, lOA at 1800 pps to 3μs 650 ma at 300 pps. A tungsten converter after the third section produces a positron beam capable of acceleration to 80 MeV. The accelerator can operate in the transient or steady state modes. The magnets used to steer the high current pulses are achromatic and can pass a momentum spread of ± 15%. Other beam lines are achromatic and can pass a momentum spread of ± 5%."
"One of the important problems to be solved for any accelerator, with the exception of those intended for a single purpose such as injection, is providing adequately for multiple use of the machine. Of particular importance is the possibility of timeshare operation, in which two or more experimental setups can be supplied with beam at the same time. The SuperHilac will accelerate ions of all mass numbers, with final energy continuously variable from 2.6 to 8.5 MeV/nucleon. Normally, to change particle and energy in the Hilac requires a careful retuning of many machine parameters and (optimistically) an hour of machine time. For the SuperHilac it is proposed to provide particles of different charge-to-mass ratio on alternate pulses, so that, for example, half of the pulses would be light ions, delivered to one experimental area, and the other half heavy ions, delivered to another experimental area. Consequently a number of new problems need to be solved. These occur at injection, with accelerating and focusing the beams in the linac, in the stripper area, and at the exit from the machine."
"The design of a 12 Mev, S-band, side-coupled, standing wave structure for electron acceleratlon is described and the experimental performance is given."
"The field radiated by a single electron bunch crossing full an iris-loaded waveguide has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. Theories are based upon the normal mode expansion of the radiated field in the R.F. structure (T.W. or S.W. modes). They show the influence of the dispersion law on the radiated waveforms, in which a mixture of synchronous and cut-off modes mainly appears. Experimental works have been made on a low energy model in which the negligible electron velocity variation allows the results to be extended to ultra-relativistic linacs. Radiated fields observed on the TM01 mode quite satisfy the theoretical predicted results, and the method used can be generalized for studying the upper modes."
"Computation results are presented on electron prebunching, including space-charge effects, which lead to a practical formulation useful for designers. A computer program has been established for an electron beam radially uniform. Results are presented on compression for different parameters : current, electrical field of modulation, focussing magnetic field. A phenomenological interpretation of the bunching and of the following beam blow up due to space-charge is given. The results given by the computation program allow the choice of a simplified model leading to a practical expression for the compression as a function of the main parameters."
"The problem of varying energy in an ion linac is discussed leading to the proposal of a new type of accelerating structure. The proposed structure is derived from the so called H-type structure and operates with travelling waves. The variation of the output energy based on the modification of the phase law is achieved by means of simple adjustment. Verifications have been carried out on experimental models. Field distribution and phase shift law have been studied with standing waves as well as with travelling waves."
"Computation results are presented showing an improvement in the final bunching characteristics when a long cavity is used at the beginning of a synchronous classical buncher. An analysis of several combinations has been done and suggests to adjoin at the entrance of such a buncher a long cavity leading to a phase-shift of about 4 П/3 for the electron around which the bunching occurs. An improvement by a factor of two is obtained and variations of physical parameters are not critical. Comparison with a synchronous buncher is done, including eventually the use of a modulation cavity with drift space. Results including space-charge effects are given for a practical injector."
 "This paper describes a technique for measuring quickly, accurately, and with high resolution, the form of the electron beam bunches in a linear accelerator. The equipment used on the Glasgow accelerator is described in detail, and some of the results obtained are presented."
"At first, a review of more general breakdown studies, performed in a specially designed sparking cavity, is presented. Then the long term performance of two prototype cavities is described. Spark rate and x-ray level are reported versus gap gradient, electrode material and conditioning procedure. Mean gap fields up to 25 MV/m have been obtained. It turned out that copper electrodes show the tendency to severe deconditioning developments while the x-ray level for aluminium electrodes remained stable."
"The description here is intended to emphasize the latent possibilities for entirely new and valuable experiments at a long duty factor linac of 50 MeV. It also outlines one way of realizing many of these in the design of a laboratory to suit such a machine."
"We present an attempt of analysis of simplified periodic RF structures. We describe the method, based upon the expansion of the fields in series of waveguide modes and matching of their components over simple coupling surfaces, then illustrate it in the case of an iris loaded waveguide."
"Measurements made during acceptance testing of the Desy electron-positron linear accelerator Indicate performance approaching the design value. The purpose of the linac is high-current Injection to the 7 GeV synchrotron and future electron-positron Injection into a 3 GeV storage ring now under construction. The linac consists of 12 5.2 meter constant-gradient sections driven by SLAC-type (TV) klystrons operating at 24 MW. Electron pulsed currents of 135 mA at 514 MeV In a 1% energy bin were measured during 24-hour tests. A positron current of 1.4 mA within an energy spread(ΔE/E) of 1% bin and an emittance of 1π mRad.cm at 385 MeV has been measured. Electron load line and emittance data have been taken. Beampulse shortening of the SLAC-type occurs above 250 mA."
 "A high degree of RF phase stability, throughout a high-average-power, physically large, microwave system requires careful attention to the design of the mechanical joints, supports and anchors, and of the numerous branches of its widely dispersed heat transfer network. The major designs discussed are: the 180m long coaxial drive line supports, anchors and thermal enclosure (for ± 1° phase stability,), the rectangular and disk loaded waveguide heat transfer and mechanical support designs, and the two 190 1/s cooling water systems that are designed to maintain temperatures at 36 ± 0.9°C and 45 ± 0.1°C, respectively."
"The design and construction phases for all the components of the 20 MeV injector linac, for the MIT 400 MeV high duty factor machine, have been completed. The electron gun and its associated drift space components have been successfully operated up to the full voltage rating of 550 kV and at duty factors in excess of 10%; the high power RF transmitter has been installed and has passed acceptance tests; 1 and installation of the injector linac accelerator waveguides and test spectrometer is now in progress."
"The RF design objective for the MIT medium energy, high-duty-cycle linear accelerator has been to optimize and extend existing technology to obtain a degree of phase stability not previously achieved with high power RF systems. The RF system, which operates with a maximum average RF power of 80 kW per high power klystron (4 MW peak at 2% duty cycle to 1 MW peak at 6.5% duty cycle), is described. Accurate phase bridge measurements on the system indicate a pulse-top phase stability of better than 10 at 2856 MHz."
"A new and very effective technique for accelerator field control is demonstrated, using a feedforward control loop to complement a standard feedback controller. The accelerated beam current envelope, which acts as a load disturbance on the accelerator field amplitude and phase, is detected upstream from the module to be controlled. Due to differences in propagation velocity in the accelerator and external cables, true anticipating control is possible by feeding the current signal forward to the controller. In tests with full beam loading (22%) in the first 201.25 MHz tank at LAMPF, peak amplitude error was reduced to 0.4% and settling time to 20 μsec at beam turn-on."
"When a coupled chain of resonant cavities is driven at high peak or average power, it may not necessarily respond in the same way as it does at low power. Differences can be caused by such factors as thermal effects, glow discharge and multipactoring which are not normally present at the tuning power level. These factors may be strongly influenced by the geometry of the cavity chain. A continuing effort is being carried on at Los Alamos to make comparative measurements at both low and high power on the 805 MHz LAMPF accelerating structure. This structure and the procedures used in tuning it have been described elsewhere in these proceedings where it has been pointed out that tank-to-tank average fields must be tuned to ± 1-2% of each other for proper beam dynamics, and that the stopband of π/2 mode resonantly coupled structures must be properly set for stable high-power operation. The question naturally arises as to whether the field distribution and stop-band in tanks tuned at low power remain unchanged at high power. Some differences have been seen earlier in the distribution of electric probe readings which were set very close to each other at low power and tended to scatter rather badly at high power."
   "In electron Linacs, the radial component of the rf accelerating electromagnetic wave and space charge both tend to increase the radius and divergence of the electron beam. These defocusing forces are commonly counteracted by the use of magnetic lens and solenoids. The use of Linacs as portable, high energy radiographic sources, however, necessitates that the weight and power requirements of each component be reduced to a minimum. This has led to the concept of periodic permanent magnet focusing as a replacement for the conventional magnetic lens and solenoids. In this study the conventional copper discs of the accelerating waveguide have been replaced by a magnetic material which is plated with copper to provide the required resistivity. Permanent magnets are placed around the outside of the accelerating structure to provide a periodic magnetic system capable of focusing the injected beam. A computer program has been developed for the iterative solution of the relativistic equations of motion which give the electron trajectories in the periodic field during the acceleration process. The influence of periodicity and axial magnetic field strength on the beam radius for accelerators operating at 6,000 Mc/sec, and 10,000 Mc/sec are discussed. Materials considerations and mechanical design techniques are discussed briefly."
       "A.C. Losses of composite conductors and synchrotron magnets are given. A new equation based on a skin-effect assumption, is presented, which shows, that the generally accepted self field calculations yield too high values. Results from loss equations are compared to a few tests an small solenoids. Losses in superconducting coils, when exposed to time varying magnetic fields have several origins: Eddy current losses in the conductor matrix, self field, hysteretic and auxiliary losses in the superconducting coils and composite conductors, hysteretic and eddy current losses in the iron return path and eddy current losses in the metallic support structure, reinforcements and containers. As all losses including heat conduction and radiation have to be removed by the coolant, the major effort will be to limit these losses to manageable low values. Losses in superconductors and composits have been treated by Bean, Hancox, Wilson et al. and many others. Due to discrepancies between theory and experimental data specifically losses due to transport current (self field), the theory of loss generation is reexamined by Ries and Brechna. This paper summarizes the results of new investigations."
 "The cryopumping system for the 200 MeV cyclotron being designed and built at Indiana University is described. The volume of the vacuum chamber is approximately 28,000 liters and the estimated net area is 3.5 × 106 cm2. Two flange mounted cryopump assemblies are used to reach a pressure in the low 10-6 Torr region. Each assembly consistg of a 20°K refrigerator which uses ambient temperature helium gas and a chevron radiation shield which uses helium gas in a closed cycle at a nominal 80°K from a cryogenerator. The pumping speed of each pump is in the region of 30,000 1/s for nitrogen at 1 × 10-5 Torr or less, plus 250,000 1/s for water vapor. Liquid nitrogen is not used for cooling the radiation shield because of explosive hazards. A cryogenic heat exchanger (part of the closed cycle) in a safe location can be used also with liquid nitrogen for cooling the 80°K helium circuit should the cryogenerator be out of use for more than its scheduled maintenance period. A method for cryopumping a beam line is also described."
"It appears desirable to surround a high-field superconducting dipole magnet with an iron shield. This gives about 45% more magnetic field for the same total current, and reduces the stored energy considerably. The leakage magnetic field is also reduced. Saturation of the iron shield at high fields introduces sextupole fields in the median plane which, although small, can introduce serious nonlinear effects in the particle orbits. The size of the sextupole fields can be reduced by proper choice of the thickness of the iron shield. Computer studies have shown that there exists an iron shield thickness which will make the sextupole field vanish at a particular field. This critical thickness of the iron shield is not too far from presently considered thicknesses which are based on other considerations."
 "The 96 combined function magnets in the Booster Synchrotron at NAL are arranged in a 500 ft diameter ring. There are 24 periods in the magnet lattice, each containing four magnets and one 6-meter long straight section. The long straight sections provide space for rf accelerating cavities, injection, extraction, and beam detectors."
 "This paper contains experimental results on the stability of pulsable solenoids and dipoles made from modern multifilamentary superconducting wires braided into a fully transposed ribbon conductor. Magnets made from composite wires containing very high ratios (1:1) of superconductor to matrix metal are very sensitive to conductor motion and exhibited considerable degradation and training. This behavior was less apparent in wires containing less superconductor even for an equivalent over-all current density. The use of \"metallic\" insulation to bond the individual wires into a solid ribbon greatly improves the performance of the 1:1 superconductors but introduces sufficient coupling between the wires in the braid to limit its use to dc or low repetition rate applications, at least with the bonding materials tested to date."
"This paper discusses the magnetic measurements of residual field in superconducting dipole and quadrupole magnets. The technique used to measure residual fields is described herein. The results of the measurement are presented and compared with a simplified theory, which predicts the basic nature of residual fields. The theory and experiment agree reasonably well despite the simplifying assumptions made in the theory. The residual fields generated in a superconducting magnet do affect the uniformity of the field generated in such a magnet. The effects of residual field are worst at low field, which is precisely where one wants the most magnet uniformity in a superconducting synchrotron. The theory suggests that one can reduce the magnitude by: (1) reducing the strand diameter in the material (smaller strands require more twist to eliminate coupling); and (2) reducing the low-field critical current of the material, which also reduces ac loss and instabilities. The theory also suggests that superconducting synchrotrons with injection inductions as low as 1 kG must have superconductor strands as small as 1 to 2 μm."
"A number of papers have been written suggesting that superconducting magnets could be cooled by using supercritical helium (helium at pressures above the critical pressure of 2.2 atm). Nearly all schemes for using supercritical helium involve circulating helium inside fully stabilized hollow superconductors. This paper describes a supercritical helium-cooled magnet which is quite different. This magnet, built at LRL, utilizes an intrinsically stable, low-ac-loss superconductor. The heat generated with the coil is conducted to supercritical helium cooling tubes which are adjacent to the magnet coil. (Several superconducting synchrotron groups have suggested this method for cooling pulsed magnets.) This paper describes the experimental equipment, which differs considerably from the normal superconducting magnet system. The problems associated with cooling the magnet are discussed, and the operating characteristics of the coil are presented. In conclusion, the paper presents some of the advantages and limitations involved with this type of magnet cooling."
"Comprehensive critical current data for a short sample of General Electric diffusion processed Nb3Sn superconducting tape have been obtained by current-voltage (I-V) observation in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe (10 T) over the temperature range 4.2 K - 18 K. Cursory data obtained for a number of other short samples of diffusion processed Nb3Sn suggest that the results presented here are typical. Data on vapor deposited Nb3Sn reported by Aron and Ahlgrenl are generally similar in the range 10-60 kOe (1-6 T) where overlap occurs."
"Pulsed dipoles for superconducting synchrotron application have been built and tested. Low cyclic loss up to a central dipole field of 23kG has been demonstrated. A large dc dipole transport element for Bevatron area use has been built and tested; the warm bore aperture is 8 in. and the design central field is 42kG. Details of this magnet and a companion quadrupole doublet follow."
 "Many superconducting devices now being built require currents of a thousand or more amperes. When the currents needed are dc and large compared with the heat leakage into the cryostat from sources other than the electrical leads, it may be advantageous to use a flux pump or ac-to-dc converter within the dewar for powering the device. The flux pumps described convert low current-high voltage ac power into high current-low voltage dc power. Pumps designed to operate in the 500 to 1200 A range at 5 to 50 W will be discussed."
  "A cryogenic pumping system capable of pumping 300, 000 1/sec of nitrogen is proposed for the Bevatron to decrease the base pressure from ~2x10-6 to ~2 x 10-7 torr. The Bevatron consists of approximately 10,000 ft3 of free volume with approximately 15,000 ft2 of free outgassing area. The magnet pole tips, which consists of 1/2-in. laminations, add a potential 80,000 ft2 of outgassing area. The design calls for an approximately 360-ft-long, 20°K surface shielded by an 80°K surface strung along the inside perimeter of the Bevatron. Initial design considerations indicate that radiant heat flux from the 80°K surface is a prime design factor which could greatly affect the operating and installation costs of 80°K refrigeration. A two-dimensional Monte Carlo type program was devised and used to optimize designs with maximum nitrogen pumping speed and minimum 80°K shield area to reduce the refrigeration costs."
"The results of a design study of a nominally 100 GeV (or 150 GeV) proton synchrotron, making use of very pure aluminum conductor magnets, operating at 12°K, or superconducting magnets, operating at 4.5°K, are presented."
"Two coldfingers differentially cryopump the heavy ion source of the SuperHilac 3-MV injector. One coldfinger near the source freezes most of the source gas load and provides adequate clean vacuum for source operation. The second coldfinger near the beam entrance into the high voltage column produces high vacuum to reduce ion beam loss through charge exchange and accidental electrical discharges. The 20°K temperature is produced by a small refrigerator in the terminal, and is transmitted to the coldfingers by hydrogen-charged heat pipes. The effective system pumping speed for air at the source measures 180 l/s. While running beams of argon ions, pressures are 8 x 10-5 mm Hg at the source and 5 x 10-6 at the column entrance. The integral of pressure with distance along the terminal beam path is 1.8 x 10-3 mm Hg-cm."
"Design features of a superconducting synchrotron to replace Nimrod are outlined. Constraints imposed by existing accelerator buildings and plant determine many of the parameters. The separated-function doublet lattice has 20 focusing periods, with 4 long straight sections created by omitting bending magnets from the appropriate periods."
"With either superconducting or cold aluminum coils the optimum design of bending magnets for a synchrotron tends to have approximately equal horizontal and vertical apertures. It is therefore advantageous to tailor the lattice and beam parameters so that horizontal and vertical requirements are equal; this imposes the severest constraints on the horizontal aperture, and the vertical tune vz may be allowed to be less than vx. A lattice has been designed with 48 focusing periods, six magnet superperiods each containing an 8-m straight section, vz = 7-1/ 3, vx = 10.45. This choice avoids low-order superperiod resonances and facilitates resonant vertical beam extraction. With 30-GeV injection from the AGS, a gross semiaperture of 20 mm accommodates all requirements, provided field error corrections are obtained from beam position measurements."
 "The existing two-mile linear electron accelerator at SLAC has a duty cycle of less than 0.1% and is limited to 20 GeV. If it were converted to superconducting operation, the duty cycles might be 100% at 20 GeV and 6% at 100 GeV. This paper discusses high performance refrigeration cycles as necessary to make superconducting operation of a two-mile linear accelerator most reliable and least costly."
"Conductor material based on the high - Tc beta tungsten superconductor Nb3Al has been developed. The available configurations are relatively convenient and low in cost, and the production method allows long lengths to be reliably produced. Transition temperatures are 18.5 - 18.9° K, and the resistive critical field at 12° K was about 130 kG."
"The transporter is in the form of a pedestal base, electrohydraulically powered to cycle automatically while moving the load in a step-like manner. The carrying capacity of this machine is 150 tons. It is designed to transport and position large magnets in the X,Y and Z axes with a precision of ±0.005\". It also provides 360° rotation of the load about the Z axis with a precision of approx 90 sec of arc. Movement may be manually controlled or fully automatic at either low or relatively high speed. The unit weighs a little over 10 tons and depends for its power on one 10 hp motor that drives three pumps of a very compact hydraulic system. Carrying range of the transporter is limited only by the length of the 440V cable that supplies electric power, and by the carrying capacity of the floor on which it travels. The most progressive antifriction devices including hydrostatic oil thrust bearings, a unique 35-in. diameter hydrostatic journal bearing, air bearings and linear motion roller bearings were employed. This device is being used successfully at a BNL experimental area."
"Muon channels have been bui lt and successfully operated at synchrocyclotrons for many years. The classical method, which was first adopted by CERN1, is to use a long series of alternating focussing auadrupole lenses (quadrupole channel). Presently with the advent of high intensity meson production machines, design work on muon channels has again started at several laboratories2 - 4 . We report on the status of a superconducting solenoid channel, which is being designed for the SIN meson factory at Zurich. The experimental method and the design are described and results of extensiv calculations on the channel performance are presented and compared with those for a quadrupole channel."
"A beam transport program for the CDC-924A Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) control computer has been prepared which includes the change in phase space properties caused by multiple scattering in target material at the various consecutive experimental user stations (\"focii\"). The beam envelope, continuous across targets, can be displayed on an oscilloscope and the beam parameters can be adjusted to fit desired conditions. The phase space ellipse at any specified position in the beam can also be displayed. Average energy loss is included in the computations to update the beam momentum. Experimental tests will be made to determine the validity of the computations."
 "The characteristics of a radiation monitoring system utilizing an integrating ionization chamber as the detector and its application to a variety of roles in a large accelerator complex is detailed."
"A remotely positioned PIN diode was built and has been used for x-ray and electron dosimetry. The data for a plot of dose vs distance (1 meter) for various degrading foils can be obtained for 40 or 50 data points in a few minutes. These data can, in turn, be used for rapid predetermined changes in the Linac dose rate without retuning the accelerator."
"Soil samples collected from the NAL construction site were irradiated downstream from Target stations at the Argonne National Laboratory ZGS and Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS. Radiochemical analyses were performed to determine the radioactivities induced in the soil. Batch-type leaching experiments were then conducted to determine the distribution of the induced radionuclides between the soil and water. Of the radionuclides uroduced in the soil, only 3H, 22Na, 45Ca and 54Mn were detected in the leach waters. The results were used to determine possible contamination of underground reservoirs."
"Some of the problems involved in calculating the neutron flux attenuation of penetrations in hadron shields are discussed. The model used to estimate the neutron source term produced by \"unpredictable\" beam losses is described. The Monte Carlo program ZEUS ALB.5, which incorporates the neutron albedo data of Maerker and Muckenthaler, was modified by us and used for systematic studies of labyrinth design. Factors studied included variations in the aspect ratio (height/width) of the penetrations, placement and depth of cul-de-sacs, etc. Some of the results of our calculations of dose attenuation are given as these may be useful in the design of actual penetrations with several bends. We also give some guidelines, derived from these calculations, for designing \"efficient\" multileg labyrinths."
"Data on F18 production in aluminum foils embedded in a large steel beamstop bombarded by 29.4 GeV protons are presented and compared with calculated results."
"Since the radiation safety policy adopted by NAL is a departure from conventional practices at other accelerators, special instrumentation had to be developed to implement it. The policy and the instruments are described briefly."
"Results of calculations for shielding against muons showing the effects of voids and magnetic fields are discussed for one experimental setup."
"The explicit problem considered is the amount and \"shape\" of muon shielding required for a neutrino experimental area operated with a primary proton beam of energy up to 500-GeV. Muon transport programs have been developed for NAL1 which permit the calculation of muon intensities within a semi-infinite homogeneous medium. Results of such a calculation for a neutrino facility indicate that an earth shield 1100 meters in length and 7 meters in radius is required to permit the use of a bubble chamber detector with a primary beam energy of 500-GeV. A new calculational method using only available programs is proposed which permits the quantitative estimation of the effect of a magnetized-iron deflector. Results from this technique show that a magnetized-iron block 1.5 meters in radius and capable of deflecting the highest energy muons by 22 mrad may permit the use of a shield which is adequate for bubble chamber operation but only 550 meters of earth in length at 500-GeV."
"For high energy neutrino beams the requirements of large solid angle acceptance and wide bandpass can be achieved with a focusing channel composed of quadrupole cells where each cell is sequentially scaled in aperture, length and field gradient. A formalism for the design of these quadrupole focused neutrino beams with wide bandpass has been developed. The theory will be presented and the results of calculations will be given for some quadrupole focused neutrino beams. Compared to more exotic focusing techniques quadrupoles offer inherent reliability and easy maintenance. The system, which can be used in either long or short spill operation, can also be used as the front end of a muon beam for a facility that would be shared between neutrino and muon experiments. The quadrupole focusing channel does not, however, distinguish between parent particle charge and, therefore, cannot produce a pure neutrino or antineutrino beam."
"A monoenergetic neutrino beam has been designed using specially shaped horn-like focusing devices and selectively located meson absorbers. The advantages of this beam are its good energy resolution, its high flux for neutrino energies below ~100 GeV, its simple layout and its low stored energy."
 "A two-section traveling wave separated beam is under construction at Argonne National Laboratory. This beam will provide 1.5 to 2.5 GeV/c K- mesons to the 12 ft liquid hydrogen bubble chamber. This paper discusses various facets of the design and development of the deflecting structures."
"Argonne National Laboratory's long pulse, 50 μs, RF particle separator requires, for effective particle separation, peak particle deflections per deflector in the order of 1 millirad. In order to give this amount of deflection to particles up to the highest design momentum, the deflector must be capable of supporting 4 to 6 MW of input RF power for 50 μs without damage. The deflector has been tested in ANL's long pulse test facility and has been operated at 6 MW, 50 μs pulses."
"An evacuated drift tube has been designed and fabricated which enables the experimentor to use the electron beam of a 2 MeV flash X-ray machine for active, low noise irradiations of semiconductor devices. This paper gives design details of the drift tube and indicates the dose levels available as a function of tube parameters."
"Because iris loaded separator structures can be operated at phase velocities other than c, it is possible to develop \"low\" momentum RF separated beams using iris loaded deflectors. This report describes a \"low\" momentum RF beam separator using two iris loaded deflectors. This is accomplished by adjusting the RF phase velocity to be in synchronism with the wanted particles. The wanted particles thus receive large deflections. The unwanted particles, because they undergo large phase slips in passing through the deflector, receive small deflections."
"Preliminary data for the distribution of the hadron cascade and of muons in a 36 ft long steel beam stop are presented. The strongly interacting flux was mapped to an axial depth of 16 ft using Carbon-11 activation. The muon flux was detected at depths greater than 10 ft by a coincidence technique where the counters were separated by from 2 to 12 ft of steel."
"The shielding properties of steel have been studied using an array of steel blocks near a target in the external beam of the AGS. Polyethylene foil detectors for 11C activation were used as beam monitors as well as to measure the flux distribution in the steel. Flux measurements were made on the face of the shield (10 in. from the beam axis) and at various locations in the array to a depth of 38 in. from the beam axis. In analyzing these results it is apparent that the usual models of exponential attenuation of flux with distance in the shield are unsuitable. A striking regularity is present; the ratio of radial distances from the target to isoflux lines is constant, independent of angle."
 "The basic concept in the design of the TAMVEC Mode Selection System is described. An explanation of the beam line logic sequence and circuitry illustrate the flexibility in control of beam line equipment and the built-in features for protection of personnel and equipment. Application of the mode switching concept to the automatic sequencing of six, 9KW dual-quadrupole power supplies for powering thirteen quadrupole doublets with full polarity reversal is presented."
"The experimental procedures, the irradiation conditions and the radiation behaviour of a number of organic materials at liquid nitrogen temperature are reported."
 "The modification program includes the design of two pion channels characterized by 04326187Po4326187250 MeV/c with ±1% 4326187Δ P/Po≤±10% and 200≤ Po� MeV/c with ±0.5%≤ΔP/Po≤±3% and a stopped muon channel with low contamination and average polarization Δ70%. Two computer programs instrumental in their design are described. BARTELBE utilizes a function minimizing code in conjunction with first order beam optics to simultaneously optimize any number of desired conditions relating to e.g., a desired optical system and momentum resolution, and a beam acceptance volume. MAGSYS is a Monte Carlo code which generates each pion according to given input parameters and follows its history through a system. In the output are e.g. detailed pion and muon beam profiles and muon polarization."
"A precision actuator and shaft encoder combination for remote handling in a high radiation and corrosive environment is described. The package allows accurate positioning of beam transport components in areas where liquid lubrication is not possible. The use of hexagonal lattice metals prevents galling or seizing of the rolling surfaces. The actuator translates rotary motion and torque supplied by a commercial radiation-resistant stepping motor into linear motion and force. Two actuators are in operation with a 7.5 cm output travel. Reproducibility is to ±1 step or 0.0015 cm. The shaft encoder resolves the turns of the motor in 1024 increments with cams and microswitches. The estimated dose rate of 1012 to 1013 ergs/g/yr in the vicinity of a SLAC high-power slit should present no problems. The second part of the paper describes a new quick-disconnect injected indium vacuum seal. Indium is extruded into a gasket groove of a flange through tapped holes by means of bolts. Finally, a blowout fuse employed in the beam stoppers of the SLAC personnel protection system is described. The fuse responds to thermal radiation from the surface of a beam stopper by melting a low-temperature eutectic diaphragm thus letting the vacuum system up to air."
"A septum magnet beam-splitting system has been successfully operated at the Bevatron. This system has made possible a more flexible placement of secondary particle beams and the simultaneous sharing of the external proton beam between two end stations. A second beam-splitting system is under construction, and simultaneous beam sharing among three end stations will soon be possible. Other developments which will greatly increase the total flux of the external proton beam are also discussed."
"A detailed study of beam transport hardware for external beams has recently been completed. This study was made from the viewpoint of reducing capital and operating costs of beam components, which could result in a greater number of high quality beams for a given amount of money."
"In order to extend the lifetime of conventional nonrotating tritium targets (say, TiT2), a new design concept for neutron generator targets has been tested successfully. It consists of a device which allows the target area to be replenished during operation. It has been used to produce neutrons [T(d,n)4He reaction] for about ten hours at a sustained 4π yield of 2-4 × 1010 n/mA-s. Tritium diffuses through a palladium foil into the target area when the foil is heated by a deuteron beam. Control of the flow of tritium is accomplished by regulating gas pressure in the reservoir and water flow in the cooling system."
"The deflection tube described here is used to harden the electron output spectrum of the Febetron 705 Flash X-ray (FXR) machine. The deflection tube is intended for use when performing electron-beam transient radiation effects on electronics (TREE) experiments. High-energy-electron dose rates in silicon are variable from 109 to 3 × 1010 rads(Si)/sec. A magnet is used to deflect all low-energy (E < 0.5 Mev) electrons out of the horizontal electron beam. The remaining high-energy electron spectrum can be used to irradiate test samples with more uniform dose-depth profiles in the test sample. More than 99.9 percent of the electrons are returned to the FXR machine via the deflection tube walls, thereby satisfying an operational requirement of the Febetron."
"Several types of hydrogen targets are used at SLAC. Some are multiple assemblies that allow the user to select liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium or any of several solid targets. The most elaborate assembly build to date has a cell with circulating liquid hydrogen, a cell with circulating liquid deuterium, and an array of nine solid targets or holes. The target in use is selected by the computer. Target position is determined by encoders and verified by micro-switches. The operation of the fan circulating the hydrogen is monitored by a magnetic pickup coil. Forced circulation of hydrogen is used in other targets where the heat load is too high to allow stable operation with natural convection, or the length-to-diameter ratio is great enough to inhibit bubble free operation."
"The high pressures and current densities associated with MG fields limit their useful lifetime to 1 μsec or less. The pulse duration of the SLAC electron beam being of the same order of magnitude, a successful marriage of the two techniques was achieved in experiments that use transverse fields in the range 1 to 2 MG as targets for a 19 GeV electron beam. The fields were generated in volumes of dia. 3 to 5 mm by discharging a very fast capacitor bank into small single turn coils, or by flux compression with electromagnetically driven aluminum foils. The termination of the capacitor bank, designed to minimize the destructive effects of the exploding coils, permitted a repetition rate of one shot per hour. Magnetic bremsstrahlung emitted by the electrons was recorded on X-ray film and nuclear emulsions. In an additional experiment, nuclear emulsions mounted in the high field region survived the violent self-destruction of the coils. In these, the magnetic deflection by far exceeds the multiple scattering, which is normally the dominant effect in nuclear emulsions."
"A beam line plug has been designed to fill the cylindrical hole formed by beam lines which pass through radiation shielding walls. The plug consists of multiple steel discs held together along their cylindrical axis by a steel cable forming a flexible snake-like structure. Other disc materials including laminates may be used to solve a variety of radiation shielding problems. When the beam line is to be used, the plug is pneumatically withdrawn into a vertical extension of vacuum line that is connected through a 90° bend to the beam line. Upon release, the plug is reinserted by pneumatic action. The beam plugs being used at the Brookhaven Three-stage MP Tandem Van de Graaff Facility are 7.6 cm diameter and provide 80 cm equivalent thickness of steel to fill penetrations through a 120 cm thick concrete wall. Fast-neutron measurements at the shielding wall surface show that the beam plug is indistinguishable from concrete shielding. A description of the beam plug mechanism, failsafe features, test results, and performance data is presented."
"A system of personnel protection has been developed for the Brookhaven Tandem Accelerator Facility which imposes a minimum of inconvenience upon the experimentalist. The amount of required security (and attendant restriction on personnel) is kept commensurate with the potential radiation exposure and does not seriously interfere with nonhazardous modes of operation. Radiation areas are divided into zones which permit selective access into low-risk areas. Personnel are excluded from radiation areas on a zone-by-zone basis as the radiation intensity rises. A perimeter consisting of zones and additional barriers surrounding the entire radiation area provides secondary protection against unauthorized access regardless of radiation levels. Violation of the perimeter causes the ion beam to be intercepted before it enters the accelerator. Violation of a high-radiation zone causes shutdown of the accelerator."
"The neutron shielding required for proton accelerators with energies < 400 MeV has been calculated by a convenient and realistic approximation procedure, and is illustrated for the case of a copper target."
"A beam-spill monitor system for the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) has been developed to meet the LAMPF requirements of fast action, reliability, long life in the LAMPF beam-channel radiation environment, and a variable sensitivity which can be changed by over 1000:1. Approximately fifty of these systems will be required, hence, low cost per system has been an important consideration in its development. The detector, an all-glass side window multiplier tube immersed in a mineral oil scintillator, has a useful range from 10-3 to 5 × 105 R/h. The electronics consist of a fast nonlinear electrometer, a threshold detector, a fast switch, a peak detector, and an envelope amplifier. The manner in which these interface with the LAMPF Fast Protect System and the analog and binary inputs to the control computer is described."
"In four years of operation at progressively increasing levels of average power new observations on the performance of slits, collimators, and beam dumps of various designs have been accumulated. The inherent longevity of high power beam absorbers based on low-Z or graded-Z design philosophy has been successfully demonstrated. Early operating experience at low power levels in the SLAC beam switchyard has been described previously. The performance of multiple protective interlock circuitry is described and system response patterns are given. Two types of beam line failures are discussed: The air burst resulting from the melting of soft-metal vacuum seals and stainless steel transport pipes at modest power densities; and the water burst resulting from the failure of heat transfer surfaces at high power densities. Problems of beam line restoration in a radiation environment are briefly discussed. Downtime to date attending beam-induced failure of the vacuum envelope has been of the order of 350 hours, averages less than 10 hours per event, and accounts for some 15% of the unscheduled downtime from all sources combined."
"A particle analyser with a 50 000 momentum resolution which allows to pass the whole accelerator emittance has been calculated. It is useable as much as for high resolution experiments as for survey experiments. Beam losses are only caused by the particles, which should be separated by energetical reasons. The coinsequence is a very small background of scattered particles expected in the area of the experimental arrangements. In the case of using the principle of dispersion matching, particularly, the particle loss can be expected to be cancelled to a very small value."
 "The TV lenses used in high radiation areas here at the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) become very brown and totally unusable within a short period of time. A method has been found whereby rotation of lenses from this area to exposure by UV light can keep a constant supply of usable lenses in service. Tests were also conducted on ZGS TV viewing ports to determine the clearing effect of UV on 3/4-in, 1-in, and 4-in-thick plate glass."
"The Princeton-Pennsylvania Accelerator (PPA), operating as a rapid cycling synchrotron at 19 Hz, produces an intense beam with a spill duty factor of 18% or less. The beam has the \"RF structure\" characteristic of PPA but also the energy modulation associated with the variation in magnetic field during an extended spill. Some years ago, a plan was formulated to provide a flat top to the magnet field waveform with a duty factor as high as 50%. This plan took advantage of the distributed nature of the magnet circuit which results in modest voltage stress on the individual components. Even so, implementation of the plan required the development of a 5kV rms, 1000A rms electronic switch. Also, static power supplies were required to replace the existing rotating machinery. Fairly sophisticated measures were required to regulate the magnet current during flat-top and to cope with the rather nasty transmission line modes of the circuit. The program has been essentially completed. Termination of the facility operating contract has prevented the actual use of the equipment for experimental purposes but all significant goals have been met and this paper describes the completed system and its performance."
"A computer code has been set up for use in calculating the magnetic field distribution for a circulator accelerator. The code calculates axisymmetrical three-dimensional magnetostatic fields, including the effect of coil current distribution. The modified scalar potential for axisymmetrical fields is derived to solve the boundary value problem of Poisson's equation. Magnetic fields for betatron poles have been computed. The results are in agreement with meas - urements."
"Transformations of a complex variable have been used by several authors to generate magnet pole contours. The work reported here is restricted to multipole magnets but includes modifications of previous transformations that allow current carrying elements, a plane of symmetry, and a return yoke to be introduced. Application is made to dipole, quadrupole, and sextupole magnets. An extension of the method provides for rectilinear dipole."
    "Precision D. C. current transformers for magnet power supplies are generally based on:-either (a) the \"zero flux\", 2nd harmonic modulator principle, or (b) the series connected transductor (Kraemer) circuit. Solution (a), while capable of the highest precision, is relatively costly and characterised by large time constants. Solution (b) while much cheaper by contrast, suffers from a high ripple voltage level and from ratio errors which stem from the magnetic uncoupling of primary and secondary windings when the cores saturate simultaneously twice per cycle of the excitation supply. The Brentford/Hingorani circuit, described in the paper, by a simple circuit change eliminates the uncoupling error and considerably reduces the ripple. A further small component addition reduces the residual ripple to negligible amplitude. Very large bandwidths (for pulsed supplies) are easily obtainable without detriment to stability. The paper describes some second and third order error sources and their elimination and concludes with a brief description of the design of D. C.C.T. used for the 101 stabilised power supplies employed in the beam transfer lines of the Intersecting Storage Ring installation at C.E.R.N., Geneva, Switzerland. Measured performances on this installation show many of the power supplies capable of half-hour stabilities of one or two p.p.m. in the presence of environmental deviations much greater than those usually experienced in similar installations."
"An ultra-narrow, high-quality quadrupole magnet has been designed for use in the Bevatron experimental area. Several magnets have been fabricated and tested. Pertinent dimensions are: aperture = 8.244\", core width × height × length = 12\" × 24\" × 24\", overall width × height × length = 13\" × 41\" × 32\" (including adjustable stand, terminals and water manifolds but excluding supply and return piping). This corresponds to a width/aperture ratio of ~ 1.5 compared to previously reported \"narrow\" ratios of 2.5 to 3.0 and common ratios of 5 or more. This narrow magnet permits significant improvement in beam target utilization by permitting more beam lines and/or moving closer to the target to achieve greater particle acceptance. In spite of its small size, the magnet can achieve field gradients up to 5000 G/in.. The measured field quality generally equals or betters that of full-size quads, which is surprising considering the ultra-narrow width and the simple hyperbolic pole shape. A compact cooling circuit arrangement contributed to achievement of these results within such a small volume."
"A flattopped switching magnet system has been developed for deflecting the beam of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) to a bubble chamber. A 13 kV, 100 kJ capacitor bank provides the pulse energy. The flattop is maintained within ± 0.005% by a low voltage capacitor bank. The discharge circuit oscillates for little more than one-half cycle and 96% of the pulse energy is returned to the capacitor bank."
"The types of power supply in parallel-series combinations range from 20kW to 825kW. They are silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) or reactor controlled. Each supply has its own isolated power transformer and interfacing is accomplished by interconnecting cable rather than interface transformers. Control is through single reference, either potentiometer or computer generated D to A convertor. Pulse and reaction time of SCR units, methods of filtering, millisecond reaction interlocking and the economics and efficiencies of operation will be discussed."
 "The resonant extraction system of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) includes a thin septum magnet with a two-turn winding having a total thickness of 0.06 in. The gap height is two in and the length is 20 in. This magnet is excited with currents as high as 7000 A (current density of 130,000 A/in2 to produce a field of 3.5 kG across the gap. Simplicity in design has been used extensively in the building of the core and the winding, resulting in an operation life test of one year to date. This magnet is used in a pulsed mode with a rise time of less than 100 ms and pulses up to 0. 8 s in length for slow spills. All portions of the design and fabrication are accomplished by taking advantage of commercially available materials and metals and no sophisticated machining practices were used in making this type of magnet. This paper describes the computer design, the construction practices, and the test data on pertinent parameters."
 "Beam steering coils utilizing \"turns\" etched on printed-circuit boards have been constructed and tested. This approach offers an economical method for achieving high-quality, compact steering coils. The circuit-boards are rolled into a cylinder and inserted inside a short steel tube. Boards for vertical and horizontal steering are located in separate layers. For our application, three coil sizes were constructed with inside diameters of 25 cm. 20.6 cm, and 17.3 cm respectively. Active length is 0.6 of the inside diameter in all cases. The coils produce an integrated deflection field in either the vertical or horizontal direction of ~ 316 Gauss-cm when excited with 5 A at ~ 30V. The conductor pattern on the circuit-board was designed to produce a nearly uniform angular deflection for all rays transmitted, in spite of the short length/diameter ratio. The magnetic field integrated over a length of 152 cm was measured at several radii and azimuths. Values at 0.4 and 0.8 of bore radius were within ~ 0.5% and ~ 1.5% respectively of the central value. Suggestions for further refinement of deflection uniformity are presented."
"This paper describes this water system and some of the construction parameters of the water cooling complex; it presents recommended solutions to many of the problems encountered in operation and maintenance. Particular attention is given to: The selection of strainers and filters; maintaining a high purity low oxygen content water system in the presence of a mixture of materials; the choice of proper insulating hoses and other fittings when voltages up to 600 volts dc are impressed across the hoses. Magnet design problems, and problems associated with a conductive deposit that forms on the inside surface of hoses subject to voltage gradients are also discussed."
"An iterative and systematic procedure for fringe field shaping of high precision analyzing magnet systems is described. Laminated pole ends allow easy and precise variation of the physical pole end. Accurate field mapping and quick data reduction are involved to determine the precise location of the fringe field boundary resulting from the shape of the laminated physical pole cap."
 "Compact, highly saturated iron window frame dipoles and quadrupoles have been computed with computer programs. Systematic and random aberrations in relation with the saturation have been studied."
 "A typical three-dimensional problem is to find the magnetic field off the end of a finite current multipole, i.e., a circular cylinder of finite length having a cos nφ current distribution along its elements. The corresponding two-dimensional problem of finding the magnetic field both inside and outside of such a current 2n-pole of infinite length can be concisely solved by complex methods. This paper describes a way of systematically extending complex methods to three dimensions. The current multipole example is used to illustrate some of the features of the method. The results are given in closed form and involve complete elliptic integrals of all three kinds."
"Analog calculation from the field needed for injection determines B, which biases a peaking strip. This starts and stops a clock, which measures 2t. This number is squared."
"The TRIMM program for analysis of electromagnet designs is readily applied to cylindrical and infinitely long dipole problems. When the magnet does not conform specifically to the ideal shape, it is necessary to substitute an analytically similar problem to obtain a satisfactory prediction of field. Two cases are presented: one completed H magnet, and a rectangular solenoid, which is now being designed. The Harvard Computing Center 360/65 was used in this work."
"During the development of a new beam current and position display system, the quality of the signals and the convenience of the display have been of most importance. The quiality of the signals from the ferriteloaded toroids and solenoids has been improved by careful noise shielding from modulator and beam return currents, and by steps taken against beam-induced microwave signals. The beam display is a set of edgewise meters showing beam current and position along the linac: logarithmic scales for current and variable gain amuplifiers for the position channels allow convenient use of the system."
"Questions have been raised as to whether the current calibration of a ferrite-loaded toroid using a pulser is also valid for a linac beam with 1300 MHz microstructure. Three experiments will be reported; (1) a comparison of a ferrite toroid and a precision Faraday cup by a nulling experiment, (2) a comparison of a ferrite toroid and a Faraday cup using a special calibration technique, and (3) a direct comparison of a ferrite-loaded and an air-core toroid. The evidence is that the error, if present, is under 1 percent. Systematic errors due to beam-induced microwaves will be discussed."
  "Four segment induction electrodes are being installed in each of the eight Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) straight sections. Due to the presence of other equipment, these electrodes can only be 10-in long in the direction of beam travel. The small length-to-width ratio of these electrodes creates special problems. Five pieces of information are transmitted from each electrode to give detailed data on the beam orbits. Four of these consist of varying dc signals representing the beam envelope on the segments. These signals are remotely processed to simultaneously give radial and vertical position of the beam. The fifth signal is an unfiltered bunch signal which is locally processed to give a fast radial, vertical, or sum signal at the bunch frequency."
"A compact monitor has been developed which measures beam current and beam position without intercepting or appreciably affecting the particle beam being measured. It is a broad band device which prevents the development of beam disturbing resonant modes. Although developed specifically for use on a short-pulse electron induction accelerator, it might be applied to other accelerator beams of pulsed or rf-bunched nature. The monitor consists of a resistive band inserted in the beam pipe wall with connections for reading the voltage across the band at each vertical and horizontal axis intercept. For pulsed or rf beams, return current equal in magnitude to the beam current flows on the beam pipe inside wall and through the resistive band. If the beam is centered, equal voltage appears on all four monitor connections. If the beam is off-center, the return currents are unsymmetrical and unequal voltages appear at the monitor connections. Beam current is proportional to the sum of all monitor voltages, while beam position is approximately proportional to the difference in voltage at opposing monitors. Tests and operating experience confirm its operation."
"A device has been designed and built to obtain the four dimensional emittance of a particle beam. Two rotating discs with hole patterns scan the beam using the Nipkov principle. The emittance is determined from 10.000 beam samples, each of which is taken in 1 ms. Dependent on the chosen hole pattern a complete cycle of 10.000 samples takes 20-40 s. A small computer is used to control the experiment and to store the measurement data. Beam samples of 1 nA and up can be measured with 1% accuracy. The emittance of a particle beam can be described as a function in the four dimensional phase space: E(x,x',y,y'), with E = dI/dV, where x and y are mutually perpendiculat and transverse to the beam direction z, I is the beam current, dV a volume element in phase space, and x' = dx/dz, y' = dy/dz. A much used representation of the emittance is given by E(x,x') = ∫ Edydy', E(y,y') = ∫ Edxdx'. phase space phase space"
"This paper describes an intercepting beam intensity profile and position monitor which was developed at SLAC. It has excellent spacial resolution as well as signal efficiency. The instrument utilizes the electromagnetic cascade shower emission effect. Net charge leakage signals comparable in magnitude to the intercepted beam current are easily obtainable. The latest model of the instrument is described. It consists of an array of closely spaced 0.0025 cm thick tungsten ribbons which are 2 r.1. long in beam direction. Experimental results as well as application of the basic idea to four different instruments are discussed. The instruments are: (1) a spectrum analyzer, (2) a vertical beam position monitor, (3) a ring inflection monitor for the SLAC electron-positron storage ring project, and (4) an accelerator beam phase space measurer."
"A toroidal induction monitor was designed for the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) to provide a visual display of beam current pulses having peak amplitudes up to 15 amp with widths ranging from 3 to 200 nsec. To achieve rise times of about 1 nsec, the monitor was designed to utilize the influence of the electric field of the electron bunch to improve the response time of the magnetically induced output pulse. The final monitor design consists of a Ferroxcube 400T750, ferrite toroidal core of 1.25 in. ID wound with ten symmetrical turns of AWG 26 Formvar copper wire. The toroid is mounted at the end of the last acceleration tube in an assembly which includes a 0.9-in. ID collimator preceding the toroid. For simplicity of mechanical design, the toroid is operated at the vacuum level of the acceleration tube."
"An amplifier for beam profile scanners of the moving-wire type has been developed in which light-controlled resistors vary the gain so as to provide constant peak amplitude. The peak output signal is independent of the intercepted beam current over the range 4 x 10⁻3 to 4 x 10⁻¹⁰ amps. The rms noise is less than 8 x 10⁻¹² amps, and the rise time at maximum gain is 20 μsec. The control loop maintains approximately constant gain during a single scanner period, yet can change the gain over several decades in one second. At any given gain the amplifier response is linear. With this amplifier in operation, it is not necessary to change the gain manually, as the beam intensity varies over the range of beam currents commonly encountered with particle accelerators."
"The usefulness of the pepper-pot emittance device for performing quantitative beam diagnostics has been extended to real time by employing a video analyzer to analyze the pepper-pot scene as viewed by a television system. The video analyzer produces a display of the intensity as a function of position and directly recognizable angular information. A television monitor displaying this information is located near the beam controls. The pepper-pot scenes, complete with beam data, can be stored on video tape for later analysis. Means are also provided for generating a three-dimensional plot of the pepper-pot scene on an x-y plotter. Time dependence of the beam emittance is obtained by placing an image intensifier ahead of the television camera."
"Synchrotron light is routinely used in measuring the cross-section of a high-energy, orbiting, electron beam. The resolution of the height measurement is limited by the small vertical opening angle of this light. Because the angle decreases as a fractional power of decreasing wavelength, it is advantgeous to use a shorter wavelength portion of the synchrotron radiation, i.e., the x-ray portion. Accurate measurement of beam height is especially important to the CEA colliding beam program. A pinhole was installed in one of the tangential beam runs and the x-radiation image of the crosssection was recorded with a Polaroid x-ray cassette. A resolution of about 0.1 mm in beam height was obtained. The measured height of the stored beam was in agreement with expectation."
  "This report describes the history, principles of design and some features of cybernetic proton accelerators developed and investigated in the USSR to obtain super-high energy particles up to 1000 GeV. A description of a 1 GeV scale model of the large machine and the results of investigations carried out on it are given. It is shown that the use of superconducting magnet units permits to obtain energies as high as 4000 GeV with an orbit of about 17 km long."
 "The former Cornell 2.2-GeV electron synchrotron operating at 30 Hz will be used as a rapid-cycling booster for injecting protons at 200 MeV into the ZGS to increase the space charge limited intensity of the ZGS. Negative hydrogen ions of 50 MeV will be injected into the booster with the electrons stripped at injection for acceleration of protons. The reasons for using this type of injection along with the history and status of the program are discussed."
"Performance figures for the past year are presented. Several improvements in equipment and technique that have had a significant impact on our physics program are discussed. Among these are the installation of two external electron beam systems, chopping of the linac beam, adjustable beam bump shaping, improved shielding, remote controlled targets, new methods of beam sharing and new modulators for the RF system. A brief presentation of our future plans is made."
"Several applications exist where the normal rf structure of the beam from an electron linac is undesirable. For example, linacs as synchrotron injectors are generally operated on the sixth or seventh harmonic; since only one (or possibly two) rf cycles are captured into the synchrotron, elimination of the excess beam is desirable. Further, it is possible to produce a single bunch (picosecond pulse) in cases where the gun pulse is less than one cycle of the subharmonic frequency. Such short pulses are of interest to radiochemists working in pulse radiolysis, for calibration of fast radiation detectors (such as scintillator response functions) and for high resolution neutron time of flight work. Additionally, in some counting schemes it is possible to use single pulses if the interpulse time is sufficiently long, which may be achieved by the bunch suppression resulting from subharmonic prebunching. This report presents the results of a study of bunching by velocity modulation employing two single gap cavities, the beam passing first through a cavity supporting the subharmonic gap voltage and, after an appropriate drift distance, through a second cavity with the basic frequency gap voltage followed by a second drift space. A ballistic analysis is presented, followed by an analysis based on the charged disc model of the beam to incorporate the effects of space charge; the kinematics are relativistic."
"The modulator built to test components for the proposed AGS fast kicker operated at 800 MW peak output for 1700 hours. Its unique circuit is described and the operating conditions are listed. The results of the testing of various high power components are discussed."
"The electron beam at the Cornell 10 GeV Synchrotron has been extracted using a quadrupole and octupole magnet to drive the beam into a half-integral stop band. Extraction is then effected by three septum magnets. An achromatic transport system delivers the external electron beam into either of two experimental areas producing a focused spot at the experimental target of the order of 1 millimeter square with a divergence of ± .3 milliradians. At 10 GeV an electron beam with an intensity of 2 × 1010 electrons per pulse and a duty factor of 10% has been obtained. Our extraction efficiency is 85% at 5 GeV and falls to 70% at 10 GeV. By using only the septa, up to 1% of the beam can be extracted without interfering with an internally made photon beam, thus allowing simultaneous use of external electron and photon beams."
      "With the single turn injection system now in use, it would be necessary to inject over 240 mA with the 200 MeV linac to reach the goal of 4 × 1012 protons/pulse in the 8 GeV booster synchrotron. (5 × 1013 protons/pulse in the main NAL accelerator.) Multiturn injection is planned to reduce the required linac intensity. The 200 MHz linac beam is allowed to debunch. It is then rebunched and captured adiabatically by turning on the 30 MHz booster rf system in steps. The present momentum spread Δp/p of ± 0.8 × 10-3 is within the design acceptance. Space is available for a debuncher if it is needed at higher intensity."
"An internal beam dump is designed for the NAL main ring to dispose of circulating beam at any time during the acceleration cycle. An abort at full beam power is an emergency procedure, but activation of the system at the end of every cycle purges unextracted protons and provides a continuous check on system operability. The system consists of a full aperture vertical orbit bump in a 50 m drift space which carries the beam onto a 6 m aluminum and steel dump. Four 12.8 kG vertical bending magnets excited from individual 18 kJ capacitor banks provide a full aperture kick in 84 μs. Monte Carlo calculations show that primary stopping efficiency of about 99.8% can be expected, but that local heating problems will require a cautious approach to full beam power dumping."
"The layout of the extraction system and proton beam transport to the experimental areas is shown. Experimental results of the electrostatic septum and Lambertson septum testing are discussed. Also presented are the tunnel complex and focusing system for the proton beam lines."
"The process of transferring the 8 GeV proton beam from the rapid cycling booster synchrotron to the main accelerator at NAL is described in terms of overall system features and optical parameters. Recent tests of the transfer system, using a 1 GeV booster beam, have yielded successful beam extraction from the booster synchrotron of close to 100% efficiency, at low beam intensities (~l ma). Injection into the main accelerator has been accomplished with indications of good transverse matching and good overall control system stability."
"The construction of the pulsed septum magnets and their power supply used in the 8 GeV beam transfer line between the NAL booster and main ring is briefly described. The solid state power supply provides 20,000 A pulses at about 1500 V and a PRR of 15 per second."
  "The titanium vacuum chambers (TVC) which will be installed in the ZGS are equipped with pole face windings for correction of the eddy current fields. A prototype of the chamber and correction windings has been installed in a spare magnet block test fixture for measurement of the eddy current fields as a function of radial position and time. The ten difference signals from 20 test coils are read into a SEL-810A computer. The computer displays the measured gradient on a scope, either as a function of radial position at a selected time during the magnet pulse or as a function of time at a selected position. Thus, the result of applying compensating pulses to the pole face windings can be shown directly."
"A resonant extraction scheme utilizing the Vᵣ = 1 integral resonance has been successfully used at the ZGS. The system consists of a full sextupole magnet used to drive the unstable protons radially inward toward a 1.5-mm septum magnet located three octants (≈ 0.3 betatron wavelengths) downstream. The thin septum magnet jumps the protons radially inward across the thick septum of the regular extraction magnet two octants further downstream. This magnet drives the beam outward into the extraction chain one octant later. Due to the scalloping of ZGS orbits at high energy, it is not necessary to plunge any of these magnets."
 "The excitation of a novel backleg winding system has significantly contributed to increasing the intensity of the AGS. The benefits of the improved magnetic lattice properties at fields in the vicinity of injection were demonstrated, both for future operations and for quantitative study of high intensity phenomena. A record intensity of 3.2 × 1012 protons per pulse was attained when some portions of these windings were activated. This occured approximately two years ago, too late for the previous Conference. The underlying ideas and computations preceded this date by about two years. While many turn backleg windings already existed on the AGS magnets, the appropriate systems connections had to be constructed and installed during a shutdown. It was hoped by now to have experimental studies using all the systems, but time commitments have prevented further work to date. However the ideas used and the particularly simple approach to orbit analysis developed warrants being described."
"A new system for fast extraction of the AGS beam is described in which the beam is moved rapidly across a hyper thin septum (HTS) and deflected into the aperture of a thin-septum ejection magnet (EM). The effects of momentum spread on the clearance obtained at the ejector septum are calculated. Orbit deformations from λ/2 backleg winding bumps centered at the septum and ejector azimuths are calculated and the effects of these perturbations on orbits near the υH = 9 resonance are discussed. Loss calculations for an electrostatic HTS indicate that proton losses will be 0.1% per turn for a .002 in. diam. tungsten wire array or 0.8% per turn for a .002 in. copper foil. The ferrite beam kickers required for the fast deformation at the HTS are described. Component parameters for fractional extraction are: C15 and E15 beam kickers = .75 mrad, E10 HTS = 1.2 mrad, H10 EM = 22 mrad, and I10 EM = 21 mrad. Results of initial tests with a 2.25 m electrostatic septum of .1 mm diam. tungsten wires at 2 mm spacing are discussed."
"Results of a detailed numerical study on the slow extraction of 200-400 GeV beams from the NAL accelerator are presented. Topics discussed are: position and strength of sextupoles, effects of octupole components in the ring magnets, vertical motion with the resonance 2υy + υx = 61, and effects of ripples in the quadrupole current. With two sextupoles of strength 400-800 kG/m, the turn separation is ~1 cm when the septum radial position is 3 cm. The direction of the beam at the septum can be varied with correction octupoles. A possible advantage of introducing a local bump in the closed orbit near the septum is also discussed."
"In the Delft 1 GeV proton synchrotron the harmonic number is changed during acceleration. This technique for reducing the frequency sweep of the R.F. system may be used to utilize to the full extent the magnetic guide field of a proton synchrotron when accelerating heavy ions."
 "It is expected that after completion of the CPS improvement programme the existing small aperture plunging kicker magnets may be unable to efficiently eject a high intensity beam because of aperture and rise time limitations. This paper describes a full aperture kicker system which is being developed to permit full exploitation of high intensity fast ejected beams from early 1973 onwards. The design of the magnets and pulse generators is presented, together with their predicted performance. The measured performance of prototypes and the results of extensive life testing are given."
"Some units of the Dubna Synchrophasotron have been readjusted for accelerating deuterons up to 10 GeV. The linac accelerating structure and rfsupply of the Synchrophasotron have been modified. Physics experiments with the deuteron beam have been started."
"A review of high intensity phenomena observed in the CPS is presented. At injection an attempt is made to describe the combined effect of space charge and resonances, which result in a loss of 70% of the injected beam intensity and a reduction by a factor of 3 of the central core brilliance. Results of measurements on the effect of a localised bad vacuum are given. The situation at transition is briefly described. Seven different instabilities observed in the CPS in longitudinal or transverse phase plane are analysed. The compensation techniques are described in all cases. Whenever possible an attempt has been made to give some qualitative explanation of the mechanism."
"Transverse resistive wall instabilities and longitudinal reactive wall instabilities have both been observed in the Brookhaven AGS. Recently an instability has been observed characterized by individual coherent phase oscillations of the twelve beam bunches. This instability is believed to be caused by high frequency resonance modes in the rf cavities introduced by recent modifications. A simple analysis shows that voltages induced in these parasitic resonances by the beam can couple the phase oscillations of the individual bunches. A normal mode analysis of the system predicts unstable normal modes with properties similar to the observations. Modifications to the rf cavities to suppress these undesirable effects have been devised."
"Single beam instabilities have been observed at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator during accumulation and storage of electron and positron beams. In the filling mode, the instability appears at about 3 mA peak current. It develops structure in the beam sausage, makes the beam horizontally larger with increasing currents, shortens the decay time, and limits the maximum accumulated peak current to 40 mA for electrons and 10 mA for positrons. The instability involves an interaction over several bunches. Coherent horizontal betatron and phase oscillations have been observed in connection with the instability. The threshold could be increased with a high frequency quadrupole powered at a harmonic of the circumference frequency. It gives different bunches different υ values, which reduces the bunch-bunch interaction. The instability associated with the phase oscillation was reduced with a cavity oscillating at a different harmonic number from the RF. Neighboring bunches now see different RF-voltage gradients and have different synchrotron oscillation frequencies. Peak currents of 70 mA for electrons and 25 for positrons were achieved. During the storage mode, vertical and horizontal single bunch instabilities have been observed. Their threshold can be increased with octupole fields. The beam-beam interaction during accumulation and without separation has been investigated. The threshold seems to be independent of the number of bunches (or the υ-value shift if there were more than 25 bunches in each beam)."
 "In linearized (matrix) models of periodic structures the propagation characteristics, or unforced solutions, are the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix for a single period of the structure. This solution is, however, only applicable to an infinite length of the structure. If n periodic lengths (or sections) are cascaded the overall transfer matrix is the n-th power of the matrix for one periodic length, which can be reduced by means of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Examination of this reduced matrix reveals that the propagation characteristics of a finite length of a periodic structure can be expressed in terms of rationalized Tchebychef polynomials. The two analyses are shown to converge as n → ∞. An example is presented to illustrate the differences between a finite length and an infinite line."
"Positive ions produced through ionization of the residual gas by the electron beam in an accelerator or storage ring can be trapped in the potential well of the beam and produce focusing forces on the beam that can shift the betatron frequency onto a resonance or stimulate other beam-dynamics effects. At low beam intensity the ions can be removed by means of the electric field imposed by clearing electrodes; however, at high intensity clearing electrodes can become ineffective when the local field of the beam is greater than that imposed by the electrodes or even harmful because of electromagnetic interaction between the beam and the electrode system. The ions can be removed also by letting them coast to the walls in the interval during an empty gap in the beam, but the length of the necessary gap in many cases is impractical. In this paper a new method, called \"beam shaking\", is proposed for removing the neutralizing ions by inducing increasingly larger amplitudes of ion oscillation about the beam until they are driven to the walls."
 "The compensation of the mismatch of beam bunch length due to longitudinal space-charge forces in crossing the transition energy is studied. The rms beam bunch length (envelope) equation for small phase oscillation is solved numerically. The results indicate that perfect matching of bunch length for high intensity beams is possible by using the γt-jump or ϕs-jump schemes."
"The beam debunching problem is approached directly by writing down the rms bunch length equation in the presence of space charge forces. Besides the usual reactive beam-wall coupling field, the wake fields caused by the resistivity of the wall material and the RF accelerating cavities are also taken into account. The rms length equation is integrated for the special case of the NAL main ring with special attention to detuning of the cavities. The result is a debunching criterion which can be easily fulfilled for ordinary operating conditions."
 "Some aspects of the transport of intense 500 keV proton beams have been investigated in the CERN 3 MeV experimental linac. Results are presented for the current transmitted through a known set of restricting apertures. These currents are considerably higher than the theoretical values for a uniform density zero emittance beam. To explain these results in regions where the pressure is too low (10-6 torr) for the wellknown gas neutralisation mechanism, we propose that the beam is partially neutralised by secondary electrons produced from metallic surfaces in the beam pipe. Using a specially designed apparatus which enables electrons to be removed from the beam over a substantial fraction of its path we find that the measured currents are more consistent with an unneutralised beam. In addition this apparatus has enabled us to determine a very high value for the secondary electron emission coefficient for proton impact near glancing incidence. Finally the possible perturbing effect of secondary electrons on emittance measurements in our low energy drift space is discussed."
"Coherent longitudinal instabilities, similar to those observed in electron storage rings and in the Brookhaven AGS, occur in the CERN PS. The resulting dilution in longitudinal phase space would critically affect the luminosity obtainable in the intersecting storage rings (ISR). A theoretical study of the mechanism of this instability is presented, including the influence of the beam control loop. A compensation technique, based on introducing a difference in the synchrotron frequencies of different bunches has been studied. We find that in the presence of beam control the effectiveness of this cure depends critically on the pattern in which the frequency varies between the bunches."
"In synchrotrons the horizontal betatron acceptance decreases during rf capture and early acceleration because the energy spread increases. We consider this loss of acceptance and propose a method for minimizing it. Consequences of application to the AGS at Brookhaven are presented. It appears that a low energy spread in the injected beam and low rates of acceleration early in the cycle are favorable."
"It is generally accepted that the region of phase space inside the separatrix is covered by noninter secting invariant curves. In this paper, computer studies of a lumped element sextupole field show the existence of \"islands of stability\" inside the separatrix. The unperturbed tune determines the number of islands and the size and shape of the real stable region."
"Inherent to the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) are spontaneous intensity dependent beam size growths that can lead to precipitous beam losses. Vertical losses can occur at intensities > 5 × 1011 protons/pulse. Horizontal beam losses can occur at intensities > 1012 protons/pulse. This paper discusses the factors affecting the beam size growth, the characteristics of the signals observed, and the equipment developed to control these losses; in particular, the (1-vx) horizontal damper and the wide-band vertical damper. Because of the space limit for the paper, the discussion will be limited primarily to the (1-vx) horizontal damper."
  "The method described by Lobb for calculating beam envelopes using selected initial ray vectors may be extended by applying the formalism of Norman and Moore to include a generalized description of the entire phase space ellipse (or ellipsoid) using two (or three) initial rays. All relevant information describing the ellipse is contained in a simple matrix and is accessible anywhere in the course of calculation. Existing computer codes as well as other linear ray tracing methods which do not presently exploit the power and conciseness of phase space ellipse transport may easily be adapted to this technique."
"A general method whereby orbit deflection measurements are converted to perturbations. When applied to accelerator structure displacements, all deviations from arbitrary plane are detected and localized."
 "High intensity, low energy electron beams from linear accelerators are used extensively in photofission and (γ, n) threshold reaction experiments. The degradation of the energy resolution of the beam due to the action of longitudinal space charge forces and the presence of a conducting cylinder surrounding the beam is considered. Results are presented for varying drift distances, beam currents, and phase spread of the bunch for an L-band accelerator."
 "The study of oscillations which can take place in a beam under space charge conditions has been extended to other distributions than the one described by Kapchinsky and Vladimirsky (K. V.) in 1959. Two sets of equations similar to the ones they established can be written provided axis and emittance values are replaced by rms expressions applicable to any type of distribution. In case of a non K. V. distribution, the comparison of these sets gives differential equations relating the rms emittances to correcting terms which depend on the charge distribution inside the beam. Such equations can be used to interpret some rms emittance increases observed either with a mismatch in a smooth focusing channel or with a matched beam in an AG focusing system."
"Envelope equations for a continuous beam with uniform charge density and elliptical cross-section were first derived by Kapchinsky and Vladimirsky (K-V). In fact, the K-V equations are not restricted to uniformly charged beams, but are equally valid for any charge distribution with elliptical symmetry, provided the beam boundary and emittance are defined by rms (root-meansquare) values. This results because (i) the second moments of any particle distribution depend only on the linear part of the force (determined by least squares method), while (ii) this linear part of the force in turn depends only on the second moments of the distribution. This is also true in practice for three-dimensional bunched beams with ellipsoidal symmetry, and allows the formulation of envelope equations that include the effect of space charge on bunch length and energy spread. The utility of this rms approach was first demonstrated by Lapostolle for stationary distributions. Subsequently, Gluckstern proved that the rms version of the K-V equations remain valid for all continuous beams with axial symmetry. In this report these results are extended to continuous beams with elliptical symmetry as well as to bunched beams with ellipsoidal form, and also to one-dimensional motion."
    "During the past 5 years there has been a considerable increased interest in ions heavier than were available from existing accelerators (M ≤ 40, Argon). The requirements for this new generation of accelerators are: ions of all masses through uranium at maximum energies of 8-10 MeV/A with completely variable energies above 2 MeV/A and with energy resolution better than l/2%. Intensities of up to 1012 ions per second are required. There are presently three heavy ion accelerators in various stages of planning, design and construction, all of which use linear accelerators as a portion of the system. These are the Unilac at Darmstadt, the Helac at Heidelberg, and the SuperHilac in Berkeley. A brief discussion of these proposed accelerators is presented as well as the present status of these projects."

    "The world's energy resources suitable for power production are of two classes: (1) various channels of the continuous energy flux from extraterrestrial sources, and from the earth's interior, and (2) chemical, thermal, and nuclear energy stored in the outer part of the lithosphere and in the oceans. The continuous energy influxes are from: solar radiation, 178,000 × 1012 watts; geothermal energy, 32 × 1012 watts; and tidal energy, 3 × 1012 watts. Of the solar energy influx, the only fraction suitable at present for large-scale power production is the approximately 40,000 × 1012 watts expended in evaporation of water and in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Of this, the world's potential water power is about 2.9 × 1012 watts. A very small fraction of the solar influx, 40 × 1012 watts, is stored chemically by photosynthesis. A minute fraction of this, stored during the geologic past, is the source of the energy of the fossil fuels, coal and petroleum. Tidal power is capable of large-scale development in a small number of coastal localities with a total potential power of about 64,000 megawatts. Of the sources of stored energy, geothermal energy is the least important. Installed capacity by 1970 is about 1,125 electrical megawatts, and the ultimate potential is estimated at about 60,000 megawatts, with a lifetime of probably less than a century. The largest sources of stored energy, other than nuclear, are the fossil fuels. The initial minable world reserves of coal and lignite are estimated to have been about 7."
 "Although the original design of the Model C Stellarator facility allowed for a great amount of flexibility with a \"race-track\" geometry, conversion to the circular geometry required for the Symmetrical Tokamak presented a number of special engineering problems. This paper summarizes and details the various changes required to meet the Tokamak concept including: major machine operations on the structural members of the stellarator, addition of confining field coils and special vertical field loops, a copper liner used for plasma stabilization, the new and larger diameter vacuum system and finally the changes in the ohmic heating coupling transformers."
 "The Adiabatic Toroidal Compressor (ATC) is being built to investigate the feasibility of a proposed technique for increasing the density and ion temperature of conventional tokamaks. By applying a suitable magnetic field normal to the plane of a usual tokamak discharge, the major radius is caused to shrink to about 0.4 of its original value, thereby resulting in an increase both in temperature and density. The experiment is important because, if successful, the technique could be applied to achieve plasma temperatures and densities significantly greater than otherwise obtainable in a given size facility. Selection of the machine size, field strength and time scale for the operating cycle was based both on the desire to achieve values of temperature and density well exceeding those already reported by others and on the conviction that experimental results should be forthcoming by mid-1972 to be useful in the design of larger experimental facilities. The first goal is expected to be met in the choice of a field strength of 50 kG at 37 cm major radius, the location of the 241 kA discharge after compression. The second goal required the use of presently available (or readily constructed) power supplies and an amount of engineering manpower consistent with existing laboratory programs. Buildup of the initial discharge within about 5 ms, a thermalizing time of up to 20 ms, and a compression time of about 2 ms are attainable within the above framework and are consistent with the energy replacement time of the plasma."
 "The 2X II, successor to the 2X Experiment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, is now operational. This paper presents the engineering aspects of the facility including the magnetic and mechanical design of the magnet system, the attendant structure, and the vacuum system. Material problems are discussed as well as the scheduling, fabrication and assembly of the facility. Design problems associated with the injection of a neutral beam are included."
"The Livermore Superconducting Levitron contains an 80-cm-diam superconducting ring as well as three pairs of superconducting coils that produce a poloidal field, that are 50, 112, and 160 cm in diameter respectively, and that are located 40 cm above and below the midplane of the ring. Twelve control coils and optical position sensors form a feedback system for maintaining the ring's position. Magnetic damping plates above and below the ring prevent it from making accidental but dangerously violent movements. The ring was successfully tested about a year ago, and the entire system is now undergoing its first operating tests. Construction details and the initial operating results are presented here."
"The Princeton Floating Multipole Machine, FM-1, has been assembled, and some tests have been performed. The device contains a 60-inch diameter superconducting ring and will be operated as a spherator. The assembly will be described with several unusual features of this new machine. Details of the unique components are presented in other papers of this conference."
"This paper describes the engineering design and fabrication of the 24 wedge-shaved coils that produce the toroidal confining field for the ATC machine. The coils have 10 turns with a 45-inch I.D. and 57-inch O.D. They are designed to produce 90,000 gauss pulsed field at the inner torus radius and 23,000 gauss at mid-radius. Stress analysis for the 380,000 pound centering force is presented."
"The construction features of the toroidal field coil for the FM-1 device are described. The coil is rated at 1.5 × 106 ampere-turns steady and has a field volume of 49 cubic meters. The stored energy of the field is nearly 2 MJ. The coil must be taken apart for insertion of a superconducting ring; the techniques for accomplishing this are described."
"In the PPL FM-1 Machine, the plasma containment volume is shaped, in part, by a levitated superconducting ring which is stabilized and positioned by servoed currents in stationary tilt and slide coils. The instantaneous position of the ring is sensed, in the required five degrees of freedom, by external non-contacting reflex optical sensors. Design and construction of these sensors is described and results of performance tests, both off and on the FM-1, are presented."
"The necessity of magnetically levitating a superconducting, current carrying ring without mechanical supports requires an electrical stabilizing system. The ring, when supported, has only one equilibrium position and this position is one of unstable equilibrium. The ring is free to move with up to six degrees of freedom. Two degrees are dictated by the ability of the ring to move in any direction in the plane of the ring. Additionally, the ring can be tilted requiring three more reference points to determine a new plane. The sixth degree of freedom is the ability of the ring to rotate upon its own axis, but because external forces tending to cause this rotation can, in principal, be eliminated, a restoring supply is not provided. Each of the five identical stabilizing supplies in this system has a feedback loop composed of the following segments. The position detector element is an optical head which sends a light beam across an optical edge on the ring, the reflection of which is sensed on a photo diode. This diode voltage signal, proportional to the ring position, is the input to an amplifier whose output is a signal proportional to position, velocity and ring acceleration. A 50 volt, 100 ampere, bidirectional dc transistor power supply is activated from this signal which in turn powers the appropriate stabilizing coil located near the floating current carrying ring."
"Described is the system for positioning, and arresting the poloidal field coil in the FM-l machine. The ring is held in the proper position, on centerline of the machine by four positioner assemblies. Rotation of the ring to proper azimuth for filling, venting and charging is provided. The positioner assemblies are lowered to the vacuum vessel floor during ring levitation or for ring maintenance. In the event of a system failure, resulting in loss of ring stabilization the ring must be quickly arrested to prevent damage to the Dewar or machine. Four scissors type, mechanisms are positioned in the vacuum vessel for this purpose. A cylinder mounted solenoid poppet valve is fired by a capacitor bank resulting in a signal to closure time of 60 msec. A slow mode catch may also be actuated, through externally mounted valves, resulting in a cycle time of 150 to 200 msec. Upon closure and contact with the ring, the ring energy is absorbed by uncoupled slide and tilt spring systems. After a catcher closure cycle the positioners are again inserted and the ring returned to the proper position."
"An automatic data system is being developed to record transient data that will replace the present method of photographing scope traces with a Polaroid camera. The advantages of the new system are that it will increase data accuracy, eliminate long hours of manual reduction of data, provide instant processing of data to aid in optimizing the experimental parameters, and provide rapid comparison of current data with data taken from previous runs for statistical analysis. The 2X II automatic data system is composed of an analog disc connected to a small computer system. The multichannel analog disc is the principal intermediate means of recording the data, which are then digitized and stored permanently on magnetic tape. Reading of the data is accomplished by scanning all of the disc channels with a single analog-to-digital converter and transferring the data into the computer's magnetic core memory. This scanning of the analog disc is done automatically by the computer's software program, but it can also be done either manually from the disc control panel or remotely from a teletype terminal. Currently the digitized data are fed into a mini-computer for on-line data reduction and display. Using teletype control, one can view any individual channel from 0 to 30 ms with 10 μs resolution, or one can retrieve processed data (for example, the number of charge exchange neutrals vs energy for any selected time up to 30 ms)."
"DAS-1800, a data acquisition system built around an IBM-1800 computer, has been installed and is being used in conjunction with the larger experimental machines at PPPL. An enumeration of the purchased equipment and the rationale for choosing it are given, as well as the overall philosophy and some details of peripheral equipment designed and fabricated in house. Software, including IBM-supplied monitors, locally written systems programs, and the experimenters' user programs, is discussed. Finally, a summary is given of DAS-1800 applications to the experiments on the PPPL machines."
"A PDP-8/I mini-computer has been used as a satellite data-acquisition station in conjunction with a larger, central IBM-1800 computer. An analog data interface to the PDP-8/I permits bipolar analog data to 10-bit accuracy to be collected at the rate of one analog sample every 1.5 μs."
"The requirement for a wideband recording capability for instrumenting electromagnetic fields with nanosecond rise time perturbations and long duration reactions lead to the development of a modulated laser beam analog recorder. The original concept of the recorder yielded 100 MHz bandwidth records of ±40 db dynamic range of approximately 25 μsec duration but required synchronization of the event to the rotating mirror camera of the recorder. Normalization of data required digital computer processing of densitometer conversion of film density data to analog electrical signal. An improvement of the original system, which permits continuous recording up to several minutes at 100 Mbit digital writing solves the major shortcomings of the analog recorder. Using techniques of signal conditioning and laser beam splitting and modulation of the previous system, the data stream is split into four channels recorded simultaneously and continuously on moving 70 mm film in a four-to-one interlace pattern. Each channel is organized into discrete blocks with data synchronizing words to provide block and timing identification. The physical arrangement of the recorder is such that film readout is effected on the same transport deck. Simultaneously scanned data tracks generate a parallel serial data train which is buffered, multiplexed, and recombined to produce the serial data stream."
"This paper describes a method of plasma wave diagnostics using digitally computed power spectral density functions. The process involves application of the fast Fourier transform algorithm to digitally converted analog plasma data in order to generate the standard auto-and cross-power density spectra as well as other useful spectral functions. The system employs a 7 channel, 1.5 MHz, analog instrumentation type, tape recorder to record the plasma data signals (e.g. density or potential fluctuations monitored by Langmuir probes). The recorded signals are digitized by an XDS930 computer and the digital output is stored on magnetic tape for subsequent analysis on a CDC6600 computer. The output of the CDC6600 computer analysis consists of autopower density, cross-power density (both magnitude and phase spectra), and coherence functions . The details of the instrumentation and implementation of the system as well as considerations necessary to achieve valid results are described. Examples of the computer generated spectral functions for plasma data are shown. Finally a description of the interpretation of the data analysis and some proposed applications are presented."
 "The two major components of the Astron machine, namely, the accelerator and main chamber, have been modified. In two successive steps the accelerator has been increased in energy from 4 MeV to 5 MeV and then from 5 MeV to 6 MeV with a final beam current of approximately 800 amps. This increased energy required a major modification to the radiation shielding. Additional hardware and refined diagnostics have been added to the accelerator to improve its performance. Among these is a unique on-line energy analyzer, a 60 MHz R. F. modulator, a new method for measuring current and beam position, and the use of titanium to minimize sparking in the electron gun. Optimization of the beam transport included redesign of the solenoid magnets and the installation of a sixty-five ft long continuous solenoid. Main chamber changes include the repair and installation of both cantilevers with the addition of a device to bridge between the cantilevers. New geometric arrangements have been made to the static resistors, which are part of the E-layer trapping mechanism. A method for quickly and accurately measuring the magnitude and configuration of the magnetic field for the main chamber solenoid will also be described."
"The parameters for the design of vacuum vessels for plasma physics experiments usually are base pressure required, plasma volume, and the geometry of the magnetic field coils. For the Adiabatic Toroidal Compressor (ATC) machine now being constructed at Princeton, the plasma's major and minor diameter changes during compression, and the compression field rise time requires a high electrical resistance for the vacuum vessel. These additional parameters dictate a unique vacuum vessel design. We shall discuss the geometry, construction details, and stress considerations for this design."
"The system of auxiliary l = 1 and l = 0 coils for the toroidal Scyllac and Scylla IV-3 θ-pinch experiments at LASL is described in detail including theory of operation, coil design constraints, method of construction and test, and installation configuration. These coils produce magnetic fields of the general form sin(lθ - hz) which, when added to the axial θ-pinch field Bo, provide toroidal equilibrium and a means of feedback stabilization. Because these coils are subjected to both induced and applied voltages, the major engineering effort has been directed toward achieving adequate electrical insulation in the limited space demanded by the low-inductance circuitry. This paper includes the step-by-step construction and test of a typical l-coil. Sophisticated epoxy potting, taping, and spacing techniques have been successfully employed. Dc and pulsed voltage tests to above 100 kV have been conducted prior to installation of the coils on the experiments. Electrical connections are made outside the θ-pinch coil in such a way as to cancel the induced voltages before they can reach the driving capacitor banks."
"High current relativistic electron beams can be injected into magnetic traps for plasma heating and containment. A two meter beam guidance system for injection and merging of two beams from synchronously fired accelerators will be discussed. The beams are injected into a magnetic mirror configuration with a mirror ratio of three."
"The conversion of the Model C Stellarator to a symmetrical torus machine produced a longer plasma confinement time. This, In turn, required a longer ohmic heating current pulse than could be supplied by the existing vacuum tube system controlling the total energy flow. A new energy supply, consisting of a high-voltage capacitor bank and crowbar coupled with a low-voltage pulse-forming network of electrolytic capacitors, has been added In parallel with the existing vacuum tube system such that the two are complementary. The composite supply is capable of producing longer pulses with a greater amplitude and, at the same time, permits modulation of the flat top."
"Two major changes were made in the Astron Fast-Pulsing System since June 1970. The hard-tube modulators used to charge the accelerator PFN's have been changed to a resonant-charge system and completely rebuilt. While no comparative reliability records are available, it is obvious that the new system is at least ten times more reliable than the old system. The pulse-to-pulse regulation of the new system is not as good as was hoped for, but it seems to be adequate for reasonable performance of the accelerator. Furthermore, significant improvement should be simple and of negligible cost. The second major change was the building of a new power supply for the core-reset system. The old system had relatively poor voltage regulation (15 or 20%). Two problems existed - the power supply and cabling system were inherently poorly regulated, and an already too small substation was shared with another pulsed load of comparable size. Instead of about 90 small power supplies, the new system uses one large series-pass transistor supply, operated on its own 1.5 MVA substation. The new supply consists of a 340-V brute-force rectifier unit with a 1-F capacitor bank, followed by a series-pass transistor bank (about 2,000 transistors) feeding a distributed 1.3-F bank at 260 V. Rated output current is 7500 A. Output voltage is sensed at the most distant part of the load and a loop gain of 1,000 is planned for the system. The major components are completed and the substation and 13."
"High power output servo-amplifiers using switching devices to control instantaneous output power can provide significant performance and cost advantages over conventional amplifiers. Of special interest is the silicon controlled rectifier when used as a low cost, high power switch in such an amplifier."
"Major developments have taken place in the art of Marx generating in recent years. The rationales, modi operandi and relative merits of these developments are discussed in an attempt at exegesis and classification."
 "The Lawson criterion is a minimum condition on the product of ion density, ni, and mean residence (confinement) time, τ, of the energetic ions within a reacting plasma if it is to be useful as a source of thermonuclear power. This criterion is a function of temperature, T, and energy recovery efficiency, η . The curve originally presented by Lawson, for a single efficiency of 1/3, is actually the lower side of a closed contour in the ni , T plane. This is readily generalizable to a cup-like surface in ni , T, η space. There is a forbidden region within which a steady state reactor cannot operate. The Lawson efficiency, η , should not be confused with the thermal efficiency of the associated energy conversion device, which may have a lower value. Examples for selected fuel cycles will be given."
"Plasma radiations striking the vacuum walls of fusion reactors may (a) seriously damage and erode the wall and (b) release major quantities of gas which will contaminate the plasma. The influence of various secondary particle-emission contributing to these two processes will be reviewed; special emphasis will be given to radiation blistering, sputtering, and the release of gaseous particles by energetic photon impact. From the best estimates of the yields of some of these processes, the lifetimes of walls made for example of Nb or Mo will be estimated."
"The nature of the steam cycle and boiler design for a fusion power plant using a catalyzed D reaction is discussed. A preliminary appraisal indicates that with a superheated steam cycle the materials and technology of conventional fossil fueled steam generators may be directly applied. The severe metallurgical. stress, heat transfer and tritium breeding problems associated with D-T reactors are, to a great extent, avoided by the use of this scheme."
"The confinement of plasma in a linear thetapinch should be improved by the application of rapid reversals of the direction of high magnetic fields. In order to create the complex currents for such fields a multiplicity of capacitor banks with greatly different characteristics has to be utilized. The analysis of such a network is complicated furthermore by an important time dependent inductance arising from the motion of the plasma. The system of differential equations for the currents and voltages at the various circuit elements is nonlinear and can only be solved with the aid of computer programs. In an iterative process which compromises the plasma theory requirements and the hardware limitations, an attempt is made to optimize the design of the experiment. A description of this technique, examples for the variation of critical circuit parameters, and a possible design are presented."
"For many applications the present standard I2t rating method for coordinating fuses is not satisfactory. Examples include the protection of solid-state devices without large safety factors, and high-voltage dc circuits. Therefore, an improved engineering and rating procedure for the application engineer is needed for such interrupting devices. This paper examines the problem and suggests a method for obtaining the arc voltage as a function of the circuit parameters and applying ratings based on this. The procedure is checked against test results for four types of fuses."
"The capacitor requirements of modern EMP generators are such that conventional energy storage capacitors are not satisfactory. New concepts of capacitor design will make available high energy density units with reliable performance for future needs. A review of state-of-the-art energy storage capacitor characteristics is presented, delineating the effect of dominant operational mode on the physical shape and energy density of a number of capacitor types. A specialized configuration of energy storage capacitor, tailored to the requirements of EMP generators, is described and its performance characteristics detailed. These new capacitor concepts may be applied to specific applications in fusion research under certain circuit conditions which are discussed."
"A low inductance 120 kV energy storage module has been developed at the Naval Research Laboratory. Fifty of these modules operating in parallel will form the 300 kJ capacitor bank for the fast reversal field of the SWAP experiment. The module comprises two 60 kV, 1.85 μF capacitors operating as a modified Marx-type circuit. The self-inductance of the module, including the output switch and cable terminations, is approximately 110 nH. This arrangement has the advantage of using 60 kV power supplies, charging circuit and capacitors for a 120 kV capacitor bank and eliminates one of the series fast synchronized switches with a concomitant inductance reduction. The bank construction cost has been drastically reduced by the module physical arrangement. The second stage capacitor is mounted upside down directly on the first stage capacitor. The first stage capacitor therefore acts as both the support and insulator for the second stage capacitor whose case rises to 120 kV above ground at discharge."
"The rationale for the choice of dielectric, size, and basic components of the system is summarized. The technology available and the state of the art in designing large wxater dielectric energy storage systems will be discussed and the application of this technology to the design of the Gamble II pulse generator is described."
"It is often desirable, due to expense in time and money, to find the cause of component failures directly from available operational data rather than to resort to controlled tests. Such a method for analyzing component failures cause by manufacturing processing problems is illustrated by an application to a group of early failures among Scyllac capacitors. The application of the method proves that the failures were predominantly caused by inadequate drying of the capacitor packs. The method involves the use of partially ordered sets and can be considered as an abstraction of multivariate regression. The advantages and disadvantages of the method with respect to multivariate regression are discussed."
"Plasma physics experiments oriented towards controlled thermonuclear fusion which have existed and are developing at NRL are summarized, with particular emphasis on recent technological experiences with the hard-core adaptation of the θ-pinch device. New experiments include a θ-pinch with rapidly tailored magnetic fields and an extended z-pinch initiated with a laser-triggered high voltage streamer. Other active experiments of related interest to CTR are briefly described."
"Over the past few years, the technology of pulsed power generators has been developed to the level where it is possible to produce powers of the order of 1012 W for times of the order of 10-7 sec. Such generators are most commonly utilized to produce intense relativistic electron beams, and this paper briefly surveys the existing state of the art of generators and relativistic beams. As examples, recent work at NRL is considered in some detail. Finally, several potential applications of this technology in controlled fusion research will be discussed."
 "Results of a recent development program to increase operating time of levitated rings are presented. Fabrication, cryogenic, and mechanical testing of 20 in. and 36 in major diameter lead shielded toroidal Dewars are described. Thirty to sixty pounds of lead shielding was applied to a glass epoxy and fiberglass substructure separated by a vacuum gap from the inner chamber. A typical installation consisted of lead-copper sheet laminates applied to a tinned copper base. Cooling of the lead jacket was accomplished by a separate cooling loop or by vent gases from the inner chamber. Mechanical integrity of the lead shield assembly was evaluated by shock testing the assembly in excess of 10 g's at 77°K. Test results indicate that the addition of 32 lbs. of lead shielding increases the isochoric operating time of a typical 36 in. ring by a factor of 2.5 or more."
"Fusion technology will require superconducting fields of larger working volume and higher field strengths than heretofore Designed. The forces that will result are so large that novel approaches to magnet design must be developed. This paper describes two complementary approaches that may he combined to yield a satisfactory design for very high field toroidal magnets. The first provides a cylindrical load-bearing, element in compression combined with return conductors in pure tension. The second follows the design techniques that have been developed in the studies of force-free toroidal magnets."
"The design and tests of the 60 inch diameter superconducting ring and Dewar assembly are described. The ring has been successfully levitated in the slide unstable mode in the FM-1 Machine. The magnet, wound of 4221 turns of 90 mil RCA Nb3Sn ribbon, has a current capacity of 375,000 ampere turns. The coil is charged inductively or by external power supply, and is housed in a seven inch minor diameter toroidal Dewar with external connections for filling, venting and charging under high vacuum. Test results of quench temperature vs. current for isochoric life of the ring at full current is approximately one hour. This corresponds to 10.7°K at 25 atmospheres."
"The time limit of operation per liquid helium charge of the FM-1 dewar is determined by its thermal characteristics and the maximum allowable internal pressure. Efficient machine operation demands that as much operating time be obtained per helium charge as practical. It is, therefore, desirable to measure accurately the dewar temperature in order to cease operating shortly before the dewar's burstdiaphragm operates to flood the vacuum system. This paper describes a telemeter system designed to monitor the temperature of an isolated dewar. The output frequency of the transmitter is made proportional to temperature via a current-controlled oscillator. Input is from the same temperature-dependent composition resistor sensors that are employed to determine dewar temperature in the nonisolated mode. Power is supplied to the dewar electronics via the inductively coupled telemeter link."
"The Baseball II magnet system has satisfactorily completed engineering testing at LRL. Over a three day period the magnet was lowered to 30°K by a helium refrigerator. Then the magnet was filled with liquid helium from the 10,000 liter storage dewar and energized to about 75% of its capability. The electrical and magnet quench systems performed satisfactorily. However, helium loss rates were greater than necessary because the permanent heat shield was not installed. A plasma beam line is being completed that incorporates superconducting magnetic shielding to protect the injected beam from the Baseball II fringe field."
"Two separated coaxial pulse-forming lines of 1.5 ohms impedance are simultaneously switched into 1.5 ohm coaxial transition lines in a water environment producing 70 ns duration, 20 ns risetime, 1 MV pulses into a common load. The pulse-forming lines are pulse-charged to voltages up to 2 MV in a time of about 0.5 μs from a common Marx generator. Feasibility of the command trigger design has been demonstrated on a single 1.5 ohm coaxial line system. Four closely coupled trigatron type gas/plasma switches are triggered simultaneously by a trigger generator mounted within the transition line. The command trigger pulse firing this trigger generator penetrates the outer and inner members of the transition line through an interface unit. The characteristics of the trigatrons, the trigger generators and the interface units will be described."
"A field distortion solid dielectric switch has been developed for starting water immersed capacitor banks with operating voltages up to 450 kV. It consists of two flat main electrodes insulated by two plastic foils with a thin aluminum trigger strip embedded between them. A simple and cheap method is used for triggering by applying an ordinary 60 kV gas trigatron, i.e. no additional high voltage pulse generator is needed. Depending upon the main voltage and upon the thicknesses of the insulating foils 8 to 50 parallel breakdown channels have been observed on a switch with a width of 20 cm. The time interval between the begin of the trigger pulse and the closure of the switch (switching time) is typically 20 ns with a jitter of less than 3 ns; the resistive phase of the switch can be kept shorter than 3 ns. Due to multichannel breakdown and to the small electrode spacing resulting from solid dielectric insulation, the switch inductance, including the connection line, is only 9 nH, the major part being due to the connection. A 15 kJoule bank with 300 kA maximum current was discharged by a single switch."
"A field distortion switch is used for crowbar operation. It consists of two flat main electrodes with a metal sheet between them, dividing the switch into two gaps. Taking special precautions, it was possible with a single trigger source to break down both gaps. Reliable crowbar performance is possible with solid as well as with gas insulation. In both cases multichannel breakdown is achieved. Up to 200 breakdown channels have been observed with solid and up to 10 with gas insulation. Tests have been carried out using capacitor banks at voltages between 20 and 60 kV and with frequencies up to 250 kHz. Maximum currents varied between 20 and 300 kA. The larger current and voltage values were used with solid dielectric crowbar switches. The jitter time of the switching device is less than 10 ns, the major part being due to the trigger generator."
"A Q-switched ruby laser was used to initiate breakdown in solid dielectric switches with a jitter of less than 3 ns. \"Lexan\" polycarbonate in thickness from 40 to 80 mils withstood applied voltage pulses (less than 1 μs duration) of up to 400 kV. Laser pulse energy of less than 1 joule was sufficient to initiate breakdown in the solid dielectric. A focusing lens and the switch container were immersed in a grading solution of copper sulfate and water. Command triggering down to 50% of the dielectric's self break voltage was demonstrated. A test system employing a miniature Marx generator, and a high energy system switching 150 kA at 400 kV to form precisely timed relativistic electron beams, are described."
"A 10-MJ Ignitron Crowbar Array for the 2X II fusion machine has been installed, and is now in operation. It is designed to handle about three times the energy of the previous array used with the 2X machine, which has been supplanted by the 2X II. In addition, this array is expected to be considerably more reliable than previous designs. Furthermore, the floor utilization of the assembly is considerably improved, access to all components is better, and the overall cost per kilojoule is substantially reduced. Two insulated identical main pulse coils are incorporated in the 2XII machine. Similarly, the crowbar array is split into two equal parts, with each connected permanently across its pulse coil. The crowbar array is expected to handle 10 MJ at 40 kV. However, because of reliability limitations of the capacitor banks above 30 kV, operation above this value is not planned except for possible special tests. With the present coils, the decay time constant of current to I/4326362 of its peak value will be about 7 msec. A mechanical switch, actuated by exploding a copper foil against one electrode, has been built and installed within a foot of the coil terminals. It has not yet been perfected adequately for use, but calculations indicate that it could extend the time constant above 20 msec."
"The need exists for a versatile, low cost switch which is readily adaptable to the ever changing facilities in high energy research laboratories. Two modular laboratory switches have been developed at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D. C. Switches may be easily fabricated within the laboratory with a wide choice of features from a basic design and inventory of parts. Precision machining for fabrication or special materials are not required. The first switch discussed has a self-inductance of approximately 40 nanohenries and operates over a voltage range from zero to 60 kilovolts. It is capable of switching from 1 to 500 joules with a life expectancy in excess of 25,000 shots. The second switch extends the energy range from 500 joules to 5 kilojoules with a reduced life expectancy corresponding to the increasing energy. It can be operated up to 20 kilovolts and peak currents to 250 kiloamps. This switch fits directly into any parallel plate arrangement providing low inductance (less than 20 nanohenries) for the switch and its terminals. All inclusive tests to determine the ultimate performance for all switch characteristics have not been made due to the variety of switch configurations. However, test results are presented which show typical performance characteristics as well as switch limitations."
"With the dense plasma focus it is important to maximize the delivered current. Through impedance matching considerations, it is evident that this requires higher voltage operation instead of increased capacitance for higher energy systems. Graded vacuum switches have been used with dc charged 50-kV, 10-kJ capacitor modules and with pulsed charged 50-kV, 17.5-kJ swinging Marx capacitor modules with good operation. For higher voltage operation a field distortion pressure switch has been developed and tested with a 60-kV, 26-kJ capacitor module. This switch should be useful at voltages up to 100 kV."
"A linear feedback stabilization system is being designed, tested, and constructed for the 5-m toroidal sector of Scyllac. Each closed loop consists of an optical plasma position detector, resolver and preamplifier, power amplifier, and one-turn load coil to apply the magnetic field for plasma position control. This paper describes the entire system; however, the major engineering effort is on the power amplifier and therefore is the point of major emphasis in this paper. The final stage of each closed loop in the linear power amplifier is made up of two Machlett ML-8618 magnetically-beamed power tubes operated in push-pull at plate currents up to 500 amperes. The output is coupled through a step-down transformer to the load so that up to 5 kA will be available for plasma position control. The design goal is to have a risetime of 0.2 μsec in the load coils. There are thirty closed loops which together can provide a peak power of 1 Gigawatt."
"In recent years there has been an increase in the use of high power microwave sources for plasma heating, and their multi-kilowatt peak powers are potentially a hazard to operating personnel. Existing instrumentation has been found unsuitable for monitoring the peak power density of the single RF pulse output required for transient plasma heating. This paper describes an instrument that has been developed to satisfy the following requirements: 1. Broadband frequency operation from 2 to 12 GHz. 2. Respond to a single pulse of milliseconds pulse width or to continuous wave conditions. 3. Be multi-range; have meter readout; be portable. 4. Provide a calibration method for checking detector sensitivity."
"Operation of the new FM-1 research device at the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory utilizes an IBM 1800 Process-Controller for numerous control functions and extensive status indications and annunciation. This was the first use of a process-controller as a full experiment controller at PPL. Practical experience was gained in the hardware and software characteristics of such a control system, as well as methods of documentation. An optimum allocation of storage exists for a system of this type. A minimum core of 16,000 16-bit words plus executive is also required. Permanent core is used for those programmed actions requiring rapid response and insuring safety to personnel or equipment. Exchangeable core is used for supplementary functions and startup-energize operations. Timing functions are affected by the cyclic updating of input and output data and methods were developed to compensate for this. Documentation provides duplication of program cards, listings and disks as means of backup. Program links, messages and designations are logged. The drafting system allows for more rapid design of new controls as well as changes to present ones."
"To investigate the trapping efficiency of a hot electron plasma and its confinement in a toroidal magnetic field configuration, a small, adiabatically heated, symmetric stellarator has been constructed. Various diagnostics methods are used to find various plasma parameters: electron density and temperature, confinement time, etc. One technique to find electron density and confinement time is to use the microwave cavity frequency shift method. This method is especially applicable in the case of this stellarator since the size of the stainless steel toroidal container is such that it can support the lowest resonant modes with frequencies about 4GHz. The resonance frequency shift method pertaining to a cylindrical resonator is reviewed and the theory applicable to the toroidal geometry is discussed. The resonant mode structure in a toroidal resonator will be described. It is shown in numerical examples that the presence of plasma will cause a considerable shift in the resonant frequency of the cavity. This frequency shift is directly proportional to plasma density and is also influenced by the magnetic field. The system has been built and is described in some detail. A fundamental transistor oscillator, which can be swept over a 0 to 300MHz bandwidth in the range of 2 to 4GHz, provides the microwave signal. An oscilloscope provides a sweep voltage which is conditioned to control the oscillator frequency. A staircase voltage is generated which is used along with the horizontal sweep to form a raster of 1 to 64 lines on the oscilloscope."
"A far infrared spectroscopic system, covering the wavelength region between 50 μm and capable of variable spectral resolution between 100 and 1000, has been built. The spectroscopic system is described in some detail. It is comprised of a monochromator, which utilizes five different echelette gratings, each of which covers one octave, of a radiometric system for absolute power calibration, and of various cryogenic and room temperature detectors. The system works in two modes: a continuous mode using the absolute power calibration, the radiometer, and continuous standard radiation sources, and a pulsed mode without the radiometer for plasma radiation studies. In this manner the power spectrum of the observed pulsed plasma radiation is absolutely calibrated. A rather new method in monochromator design utilizing ray transfer matrix method and phase space diagrams is discussed, and various optical errors in the system are evaluated. The method of performing and the evaluation of radiation studies utilizing this system is presented. The system will be used in the very near future to measure the far infrared radiation from several of our fusion experiments: from Texas Tokamak, a large experimental fusion device; from a small, adiabatically heated, symmetric, hot electron stellarator; and from some other hot plasma devices. These experiments have strong magnetic fields, ranging between 30 to 5OkG. Moreover, high electron temperatures--between 1 to 20 keV--are expected, so that the synchrotron radiation in the far infrared will be appreciable. Synchrotron radiation from Tokamak as a function of the electron temperature and density is discussed."
"In contrast to plasma diagnostic probes having linear motion only, recent years have seen an increase in the number of special diagnostic devices having multiple degrees of freedom. In addition, the single custom-built probe tip has gradually yielded to the concept of mounting several pre-set probe tips on \"plug-in\" type probe holders. Several of the special diagnostic devices, designed to solve particular positioning and measurement problems, are described and illustrated. In particular, the problems associated with achieving the various mechanical movements within a vacuum, and the methods employed in controlling the coaxial conductors from the probe tip to the vacuum feedthrough are discussed."
"The use of laser light as a monitor for the state of a hot dense plasma is one of the most important and reliable plasma diagnostic techniques. Problems encountered in Thompson scattering electron temperature measurements and interferometric density measurements are discussed. Finally, the possibility of two-wavelength scattering yielding a deep insight into the phase space distribution of a plasma is presented."
 "An adaptive system for the control of the power level of a nuclear reactor is described. The controller has a square-law element of variable gain, optimum values for which have been obtained from off-line computations for certain power levels and parameter values. When conditions in the reactor deviate from those assumed for the off-line optimization, the gain factor is adapted on-line, such that the difference between actual and demanded power levels is minimized. An existing power reactor and associated control system have been simulated, as well as the proposed adaptive scheme. The results show that the adaptive controller gives improvements by at least an order of magnitude in the accuracy of following power demand changes, and at the same time reduces the necessary control effort. Since the scheme entails only a small number of arithmetic and logical operations and has limited memory requirements, it may be implemented on a conventional process computer, or built as a special purpose digital control system."
"A numerical solution is presented that may be used to assess the effects of simultaneous excitation of a flat cable by a pulse of ionizing radiation, and by an internal electromagnetic pulse (IEMP) varying with both time and position along the line. The cable is allowed to be closely coupled to a reference conductor and transient changes in dielectric conductivity along the line are allowed."
"Several Gunn and IMPATT diodes were subjected to neutron and gamma radiation while in oscillation. This provided data which could not be obtained by diode testing after irradiation. Non-passivated IMPATT diodes were most tolerant of neutron fluence effects. Gunn diodes were insignificantly influenced by this radiation flux but failed at lower fluence levels than did the IMPATT diodes."

 "This paper describes the design, construction, and performance of a time base generator for use with a cathode ray tube capable of displaying fractional nanosecond transients. The generator was designed for use with a traveling wave cathode ray tube having a simple electrostatic time base deflection structure. When operating into the deflection plates (total capacitive load of 25 pF), the generator produced a total ramp excursion of -4 kV with a maximum average slope of about -450 V/ns. with a maximum repetition rate of 10 kHz. The ramp slope may be decreased continuously by a control voltage. The generator may also be operated into a 50 ohm load for the production of a -750 V transition with a 10%-90% transition time of 4.8 ns."
"A theory is formulated for the static properties of silicon junction field-effect transistors which are compensated with defects with deep energy levels. A single effective level of an acceptortype 0.40 eV below the conduction band accounts satisfactorily for the degradation of heavily doped n-channel devices with neutron irradiation. Furthermore, based on the existence of defect levels, a frequency dependence of the transconductance is predicted and observed experimentally. The charging and discharging of the defects in the junction space-charge region can follow only at low frequencies. At higher frequencies (above 10-100 kHz at room temperature) the trapped charge cannot respond to the signal frequency very rapidly and the transconductance may be several times higher than the low frequency value."
"A miniature superconducting 52 ohm coaxial transmission line 278 meters long, having a lead outer conductor (0.129 cm id), a teflon dielectric, and a niobium center conductor (0.038 cm), has been measured in both the time and frequency domains. The observed system step response (10% - 90%) times were 1.5 μs at room temperature, 375 ns at 77K, and 255 ps at 4. 2K. The system step response data for 4.2K was processed by a numerical system identification routine to determine the step response of the miniature superconducting line; the processed data gave a 220 ps risetime. Although the observed step responses at 4.2K were smooth transitions, the observed swept frequency (0.1 GHz - 12 GHz) attenuation at 4. 2K was a quasi-periodic function of frequency, which indicated that the nonuniformity of the superconducting line was significant. For example, near 5 GHz and at 4.2K, the attenuation minimum was 1.1 dB while about 0.5 MHz away the attenuation was 5 dB. By making normal conductivity measurements of the Nb conductor and incorporating the results into the two fluid model, the uniform line attenuation for 5 and 10 GHz was calculated with the classical and anomalous limits. The lowest observed attenuation values in the vicinity of 5 and 10 GHz fell between the computed classical and anomalous limit attenuation values."
"When electronic circuitry is exposed to a shock wave of nuclear origin, intense acoustic agitation occurs within each of the components. Obviously, each component must be exceedingly strong mechanically in order to withstand such conditions. Our work primarily concerns survival of transistors and integrated circuits. In these devices there is a tendency for elastic or plastic surface ripples to develop on the headers or flatpacks. These ripples previously were quite difficult to record, although they were known to be the primary cause for cracking of transistor chips or microcapacitors from their substrates. However, we now have a system for photographing such motions on polished surfaces. This system is based on incoherent (or geometrical) optics, and thus does not require the use of a massive optically stable bench. Up to 130 frames may be taken in 6.5 μsec at a rate of 50 nsec/frame. It is possible to observe disturbances as small as 100 μm wide by .1 μm high, and group velocity may be as fast as 5 x 109 μm/sec. For illustration, in this article we present photographs of ripples on a transistor header which has been subjected to a shock wave generated by a pulsed electron beam."
"The effects of 3 MEV electron bombardment on the shot noise properties of silicon junction transistors were studied. The noise figures of the transistors were greatly affected, especially at high source resistances, by the increase of the gene ration-recombination current in the emitter junction after electron bombardment. The results of noise figure measurements show good agreement with the noise figure equation which contains the generation-recombination factor me . A discrepancy between the expression of i21 derived by Schneider and Strutt and that by van der Ziel is illustrated and the effect of this discrepancy on the expressions for the noise figure is shown in this pape r."
"A discussion is presented of the extent of radiation effects encountered with radiation source models and the status of protection techniques for representative science instruments proposed for the Outer Planets Grand Tour missions. Preliminary results of a literature search to collect damage/interference effects data on sensitive components such as silicon detectors and vidicon tubes are described along with results from the various experimenters whose instruments have been used as models in previous studies."
"Radioisotope thermal electric generators (RTG's) and radiation heater units (RHU's) are presently being used or considered for sources of electrical power and heat for the Apollo, Pioneer and Viking Projects. Both RTG's and RHU's have considerable merit if proper precautions are taken to compensate for overall system response to the nuclear radiation sources. This paper summarizes the nuclear characteristics of plutonium fuel which gives rise to the radiation from both RTG's and RHU's, gives Monte Carlo estimates of the neutron and gamma isodose profiles from a 2200 watt (th) HELIPAK** thermoelectric generator and concludes with a presentation summary of shield thicknesses required for several sensitive radiation experiments due to combined RTG-RHU fields. This study is a part of a continuing program of analysis at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the evaluation of RTG radiation fields on an outerplanet spacecraft."

 "Charge-state effects in displacement damage in covalent semiconductors are reviewed. Specifically the influence on defect production mechanisms, configurations, mobility, annealing kinetics, interaction and dissociation are discussed. The recent theoretical work on the split-interstitial is mentioned, as is the new athermal migration mechanism."
"The metallic spike model for neutron damage has been shown to account for the observed anomalous infrared absorption in GaAs. In this paper, the electrical properties of semiconductors containing metallic spikes are explored. The metallic zones are shown to act as deep potential wells which trap carriers from the host semiconductor energy bands. The component of mobility associated with carrier scattering from the depletion region surrounding charged spikes is estimated as a function of temperature, including the temperature dependence of the trapped charge. Hall measurement data taken before and after neutron irradiation of n-type GaAs are compared with theory and good agreement is obtained. It is proposed that the high field trapping and slow release of electrons observed in neutronirradiated Gunn diodes is associated with the presence of metallic spikes. Hot electrons in high field domains penetrate the electrostatic barrier and are trapped within the spikes. When the low field condition is restored, excess electrons return to the host semiconductor matrix. The rate of escape of excess electrons is estimated from considerations of the processes of emission over and tunneling through the electrostatic barrier. Measurements of the temperature - dependent decay rates of the excess charge are obtained from neutron-irradiated Gunn diodes. Two decay rates were obtained at each temperature. The shorter decay time shows a temperature dependence consistent with a quantum tunneling mechanism. The longer decay time shows a stronger temperature dependence which is in qualitative agreement with emission of electrons over the barrier."
"Radiation-induced changes in the photoluminescence spectra of cadmium sulfide have been measured over a wavelength range from 4800 to 5400 Å. Gamma-ray induced changes in the 4.2°K photoluminescence spectra show a reduction in intensity of bound exciton transitions I1 and I5 and edge emission in contrast to an enhancement of a spectral line at 4867.2 Å (which we designate as IR). These changes were measured for irradiation temperatures of 300°, 78°, and 4.2°K. The 78°K photoluminescence shows that exciton emission is more sensitive to radiation-induced changes than is edge emission. Thermal annealing takes place below room temperature, particularly in the 140° to 260°K region. The sensitivity of the luminescence intensity to radiation exposure only at cryogenic temperature anid the thermal annealing of the radiation-induced changes are attributed to the mobility of defects at and below room temperature. Studies of polarized luminescence and the temperature dependence of the luminescence show that IR is like the I2; exciton lines. Optical quenching at 4.2°K indicates that the defect responsible for IR is sensitive to its charge state. The results of electron exposures at various energies at approximately 90°K show that IR is associated with a sulfur defect, possibly SI"
"Laser emission of CdSe excited by Ga(AsP) laser diode has been studied near liquid helium temperature both before and after irradiation with fast neutrons. Irradiation introduces new laser peaks at ~6895Å, ~690Å, and ~6924Å, which are situated at longer wavelengths as compared to the peaks observed before irradiation. The laser peak at ~6905Å can be associated with the strong spontaneous emission that is observed at the same wavelength after irradiation. These results are interpreted in terms of the recombination of excitons bound to the defects introduced by irradiation."
"A set of experiments was performed at the White Sands Missile Range Fast-Burst Reactor Facility in which measurements were made of the annealing of three types of transistors (two NPN and one PNP) which were irradiated while biased off. Anneal factors as high as 5 or 6 were observed in the NPN devices when turned on tens of milliseconds after the neutron burst. The PNP device (2N2875) showed an anneal factor of nearly 4 when turned on 29 msec after the radiation pulse. The injection dependence of the annealing is clearly evident."
"The junction field effect transistor has been employed to study trapping centers introduced in silicon by fast neutron irradiation. Extensive measurements have been made of both the static and dynamic characteristics of irradiated devices. The effects of neutron-produced traps have been explored in both n and p channel devices, as a function of neutron fluence and dopant concentration. The trapping center effects on small signal transconductance and large signal pulse response are characterized and the data are compared to appropriate theories to determine ionization energy values for the dominant traps. In n-type, trap energy levels of Ec - 0.38 ± 0.03 and Ec - 0.46 ± 0.03 eV are obtained, and in p-type an energy level of Ev + 0.29 ± 0.03 eV is observed."
"Carrier removal effects in n-type silicon as a result of neutron irradiation and subsequent heat treatment have been monitored by Hall effect and conductivity measurements at a temperature of 275°K. Samples of float-zoned, crucible, and Lopex grown (ρ=100 to 0.3Ω-cm) phosphorus-doped silicon and float-zoned and Lopex grown (ρ= 30 to 0.3Ω-cm) lithium-doped silicon were irradiated at ambient temperature with ~5-MeV neutrons and, subsequently, heat-treated between 20 and 200°C. The carrier removal rates for the lithium-doped samples, 7 to 75 cm-1 were significantly higher than the removal rates observed in the conventionally-doped samples, 6 to 12 cm-1. In addition, the lithium-doped material exhibited a strong dependence of removal rate on dopant concentration; whereas, the data for the conventional samples were relatively independent of dopant level. Upon subsequent heat-treatment, the lithium-doped samples showed continued carrier removal, while the phosphorus-doped samples tended to recover to a preirradiation condition. The enhanced carrier removal in the lithiumdoped material was found to be consistent with the removal of positively-charged lithium donors from a state of electrical activity by ion-drift to the negatively-charged defect cluster. Relevant parameters yielded by this model are: a defect cluster radius of 300A, a cluster charge of -150e, and an effective capture radius for the lithiumdrift of 2500Å. The continued carrier removal in the heattreated, lithium-doped silicon follows kinetics expected for the precipitation of lithium at the neutron-produced defect cluster sites through a diffusion-limited process. The model yields an activation energy of ~0.62 eV which compares well with the ~ 0."
"A calculation of the reverse annealing process in neutron-burst irradiated p-type silicon at 300°K was performed, utilizing a variation of the equilibrium cluster theory of Gregory. Material conditions which were considered included 1, 10, and 100 Ω-cm material with an injection ratio of 10-6 , and 1 Ω-cm material with injection ratios of 10-7 and 10-8. This calculation demonstrated the relationship between the peak and time of occurrence of the damage constant versus time curve and the material resistivity and injection level. It was also shown that the reverse annealing rate depends upon the capture rate of defects in the cluster, rather than the rate of transport of defects from the depletion region to the cluster. These carrier capture rates were such that the forward annealing process usually began before the clusters reached charge saturation. Finally, it was concluded that an injected minority carrier pulse lasting less than 5×10-6 sec after burst will not appreciably affect the reverse annealing process."
 "The effects of ionizing radiation in large-geometry MOS structures were studied by use of internal photoemission techniques. Barrier heights at both the silicon-silicon dioxide and the silicon dioxide-metal (chromium and aluminum) interfaces were measured before and after irradiation in a Co60 gamma cell. It was determined that the measured barrier energy heights may be considerably reduced by radiation-induced oxide charge. The internal photoemission technique also provided significant information concerning the effects of impurities in the oxide and the related radiation hardness of the oxide layer. Oxide layers doped with chromium ions showed significant electron trapping at two discrete energy levels (3.4 and 3.8 eV). Samples exhibiting the 3.4 eV level showed great radiation hardness, while those with only the 3.8 eV peak were very radiation soft. The information obtained, using the internal photoemission technique, has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms and fabrication processes associated with radiation-hardened MOS devices."
"Radiation stability of the MOS system is controlled by the oxide-silicon and oxide-metal barriers; oxide-metal interactions and certain dopants appear to affect the radiation sensitivity. It is shown that the OS system behaves differently from the MOS system. The effect of metals have been studied with the use of aluminum, molybdenum and chromium. Chromium appears to be a desirable metal; when this electrode is used other factors also assume importance. The best results obtained with chromium gate p-enhancement transistors are: a shift of only 1.5 V (~1011 charges/cm2) with a Co-60 source depositing 2 x 107 rad(Si) or 1.5 MeV electrons depositing 1014 electrons/cm2. The change in surface mobility is small. Isothermal relaxation experiments show a wide range of activation energies, some of which are characteristic of the metal used. Studies related to the \"photocurrent\" flowing during irradiation appear to indicate that the prevailing model for radiation \"damage\" must be altered."
"Charging effects observed in MOS structures which have been exposed to sputtering plasmas or electron beam deposition suggest that Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) or soft X-radiation is important in producing these effects. Our experiments show that under positive gate bias VUV irradiation produces large positive charging effects for photon energies above 8.8 eV, the threshold for electron-hole pair creation in SiO2. This charging appears to be accompanied by an increase in interface state density. VUV radiation proves to be more useful than higher energy quanta or particles in studying radiation charging. This is true because one can control the depth of radiation absorption into the oxide. Etching experiments show that positive charge is induced near the Si-SiO2 interface even when radiation is absorbed near the gate electrode. This result is strong evidence in support of the hole transport and trapping model. We present evidence that under irradiation with positive bias, positive space charge is formed near both interfaces. We also show how a large positive space charge can be introduced into the oxide without a gate electrode."
"The existence of a rapid annealing phase in the decay of space charge induced in silicon dioxide by pulsed irradiation has been demonstrated. This effect has been observed in MOS structures prepared from both wet and dry thermal oxides and also in several commercial N-channel MOSFET's. A simple model involving thermal release of the trapped positive charge from a distribution of oxide trapping levels conveniently approximates the major features of short-term annealing."
"Various phenomena occuring during ionizing or particle irradiation of vitreous silica and Si-SiO2 interface structures are explained. Densification and changes in bond polarizability are due to the basic trend of maximizing π-bonding between Si and O atoms with minimum bond strain. Hole trapping in SiO2, as exhibited, e.g., in irradiated MOS devices, is an intrinsic property of the Si-O bond. Irradiation generates trivalent Si and non-bridging O defects. These interact with impurities, especially SiOH and SiH groups, as well as with interstitial H. These defects determine the radiation behavior of vitreous silica and Si-SiO2 interfaces, as well as the stability of MOS devices."
"It has been found for p-channel MOS devices that considerably better radiation tolerance than generally believed possible can be obtained with gate insulators of thermally grown SiO2, provided that the processing conditions are optimized for radiation resistance. The oxidation ambient and temperature, the post-oxidation annealing temperature, the silicon orientation, and the method of depositing the gate metal all have pronounced effects on the radiation-induced degradation. With these parameters optimized for radiation hardness, gate threshold shifts of less than one volt after 1 × 106 rads (Si) can be obtained over the entire range of gate biases from 0 to -30 volts. This paper describes these findings and their applicability to the fabrication of radiation-hardened MOS circuits."
"We consider the effects of ionizing radiation on Complementary Metal-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon structures for oxide thicknesses in the range of 20-50Å. The bi-directional radiation-induced threshold-voltage shifts in CMNOS structures are interpreted in terms of charge accumulation at the nitride-oxide interface. The electronic recovery of pre-irradiation threshold voltage levels by carrier transport through the thin oxide is shown experimentally."
 "A technique of \"burning in\" a preferred state in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) memory cells using ionizing radiation such as electron bombardment or X-rays is described. When the memory power is removed and reapplied, the memory will always configure itself to the preset information pattern while still allowing normal electrical alteration of stored information in either random access memory (RAM) or shift register configuration memory chips. Potential applications of this data \"burn in\" technique are as an additional or improved method of fabrication of read only semiconductor memories (ROM) and reprogrammable read only memories. Considerable application also exists for a memory which can be caused to turn on in a particular information pattern each time power is interrupted and reapplied and still operate after turn on as an ordinary electrically alterable memory."
 "In recent years a variety of models have been developed for the computation of the photon radiation-induced electron emission from matter, ranging from pure Monte Carlo models, which while rigorous are quite costly for application as an engineering tool, to pure analytical models, which while convenient and inexpensive have strictly limited ranges of validity. The limitations of analytical models due to the neglect of Auger and secondary contributions to the emission current and due to the neglect of electron multiple scattering in the emission calculation are examined in this paper. A one-dimensional model is developed for predicting the relative magnitudes of the photoelectron, Compton, Auger, and secondary electron contributions to the emission current, and the model predictions are correlated with experimental data. It is concluded that a generally applicable emission model should include treatment of the Auger and secondary electrons as well as the photoelectrons and Compton electrons. The significance of electron multiple scattering in the calculation of the emission is examined through comparisons of analytical, Monte Carlo, and experimental data. It is concluded that while multiple scattering may be neglected in the calculation of forward emission efficiency, it must not be neglected in the calculation of backward emission effeciency or angular distribution of emission. An alternative emission computational model is introduced which utilizes a synthesis of analytical and Monte Carlo techniques. Comparisons of the model predictions to experimental data for forward and backward emission efficiency, energy spectrum, and angular distribution are included."
"Energy and charge transport by secondary electrons across interfaces between gamma irradiated materials can be important for accurate predictions of radiation effects. In order to measure these charge transport effects air ionization and secondary electron emission currents were observed in a multiple cavity aluminum chamber adjacent to tungsten and beryllium under Co60 γ radiation. It is found that low-energy secondary emission measurements are within 3% of air ionization measurements made in the same chamber and that both measurements agree with previously reported ionization measurements of energy deposition profiles. Also, profiles obtained in relatively thin aluminum chambers (~ 20% of the maximum energy electron range), sandwiched between different combinations of beryllium and tungsten, can be accurately predicted from a linear superposition of single interface data. Finally, electric charge separation is observed at gamma irradiated boundaries even in the absence of applied electric fields. The sign and magnitude of the charge is found to depend upon the direction of the incident beam as well as the material combination. The change in electron current as a function of the distance from the interface can be obtained from the data presented."
"A model has been developed to facilitate the calculation of electron transmission currents and potentials generated in partially gas-filled enclosures as a result of photon irradiation. The significance of the presence of air or any ionizable gas in modifying electron transmission currents and potentials is emphasized in the analysis. A computer code has been developed to perform detailed calculations. The parametric variations of transmitted current and potential as a function of pressure, gap spacing, time, pulse shape, and incident intensity are illustrated by representative calculations."
"An experimental study has been made of photoemission from several polymers, including polyethylene, kapton, teflon, and polyvinyl chloride, under irradiation by 15-25 keV photons. The emission intensities from these plastics were compared to those from several conductors, ranging from carbon to tantalum, and from other insulators, such as glass and mica. For all these materials, the relative magnitude of photoemission was found to be mainly proportional to the photoelectric absorption coefficient. Under this pulsed irradiation, the insulators emitted as conductors when backed by conducting sheets but exhibited reduced emission associated with trapped charges when isolated."
"Selected thermoluminescent (TL) properties of CaF2 Dy TLD's have been investigated for a single batch of crystals. These include phosphor response, glow curve structure, long term signal fading, and pre-irradiation annealing effects. Co60 exposures ranged from 0.1 roentgen (r) to 3 × 103 roentgens (r). Comparisons are made with data presently available in the literature and notable discrepancies are identified. These discrepancies are used to demonstrate the necessity of characterizing the TL properties of each batch of CaF2 :Dy crystals prior to use as a radiation detector. Techniques developed during the investigation for improving the accuracy of dosimetry data obtained with the phosphor are discussed."
"Two neutron detectors were designed to have a high ratio of neutron to gamma ray sensitivity for time resolved measurements of intense neutron pulses. One detector utilized a thin aluminum foil sandwiched between two fission foils in an evacuated chamber. The foils were thick compared to the range of fission fragments. Fission fragments passing through the surfaces created secondary emission electrons, producing a large neutron induced signal compared to the gamma-ray induced response. The second detector utilized a pair of silicon fission fragment detectors exposed to a 235U foil at the opposite end of an evacuated tube. One silicon detector was exposed to both the gamma ray background and the neutron induced fission fragments from the foil, while the second silicon detector was shielded from the fission fragments by a thin aluminum shield, but otherwise was exposed to the same background radiation. Thus, the time resolved neutron signal could be recorded by observing the differential signal from the two silicon detectors with an oscilloscope and camera. The approximate neutron sensitivities of the two detectors were calculated and compared to the experimentally measured values obtained from exposures to thermal and fission spectrum neutrons."
"Over the past several years a number of semiempirical or theoretical curves have been generated to represent the neutron-induced displacement effects in silicon as a function of neutron energy. Since the mode of failure for most silicon semiconductor devices is a loss of gain and this is, in turn, proportional to the reduction in carrier lifetime the same curves are used to express both the neutron energy damage effectiveness for devices as well as the degradation of lifetime. A useful feature of such a curve is that the damage produced in a semiconductor by a neutron fluence of a given energy spectrum may be predicted by folding the spectral information together with the damage curve. Once this is done, the damage may be expressed as that resulting from an equivalent monoenergetic neutron source (the monoenergetic equivalent). This procedure enables the results of an exposure to a source of one spectrum to be used to predict the effects of a different one. In order for this technique to be useful as a means of communication there must be some standardization of the damage curve, the neutron energy to which the damage is referred and the description of the spectrum. Recent interest, throughout the radiation effects community, in establishing such a standard has prompted several proposals each of which contains some shortcomings. This paper compares the various deficiencies and merits and arrives at what constitutes a minimum set of requirements for standardization at this time."
"This paper describes how systematic selection of transistor models can be incorporated into the computer simulation of circuit behavior. The selection is so done that each model chosen provides the best accuracy-simplicity compromise for the circuit environment in which each transistor resides. Compared with other procedures now available, the method described here simplifies computation, saves computational cost, and enables simulation of larger circuits. Applicability to the simulation of circuit behavior in a radiation environment is discussed."
"Results are presented on a generalized approach to derive radiation-inclusive simplified terminal models of linear microcircuits for use in computer aided systems analysis. The resulting models represent the complex driving-point impedances, the forward and reverse voltage transfer functions, and the ionizing-radiation induced transient photoresponse. The technique has been demonstrated by generating a terminal model of the μA709 operational amplifier, with the resulting model having 50 times fewer elements than the \"detailed\" model."
"A practical approach to modeling large systems in terms of simplified component models is presented. The modeling approach uses a state variable formulation and provides practical techniques for predicting the transient response of large, closed loop systems using presently available computer-aided circuit analysis programs. A simplified terminal model for a J-K flip-flop is developed, and five flip-flop models are used to model a divide by twenty counter. Using the \"system\" model, the response of the counter in an ionizing radiation environment is determined."
"The radiation effects modeling reported here reflects a black-box approach to the desired behavior, and does not necessarily bear a direct relationship to the physics of the real processes taking place within the microcircuit when stressed by radiation environments. The gamma dose rate and neutron fluence effects modeling are only representative of radiation effects modeling which could be incorporated into the basic model; and in no sense should they be interpreted as being exhaustive of the radiation effects which need to be modeled, or of the intrinsic capabilities of the model to be easily modified."
 "The radiation response of the RSN54L series of low power TTL logic circuits was observed after exposure to Flash X-ray, neutron and electron beam environtnents. Several matching types of memory and non-memory SN54L circuits were irradiated in the Flash X-ray environments forming a transient hardness comparison of the hardened and standard low power families. Both DC and switching electrical specification measurements were made on four hundred and eighty (480) RSN54L gate circuits. These terminal measurements served as a monitor for the permanent degradation effects from neutron irradiation. Wide pulse and catastrophic failure tests were run using the electron beam. The RSN54L circuits were found to survive a neutron fluence of 1×1014 n/cm2 (1 MeV equivalent) at full fanout. They sugvived a total dose in the electron beam of 1×108 Rad(Si) and had a transient failure threshold higher than 3×109 Rad(Si)/s."
"A method is presented for predicting transistor annealing factors, in continuously ON devices, from a simple electrical measurement on a device. A nomograph has been derived from experimental data which relates annealing factors at any time after exposure to the electron density in the base-emitter space-charge region. The electron density in this region can be obtained by a single measurement of VEE, at the transistor operating current of interest. The effects of transient annealing are investigated for two typical circuit situations (power-inverter circuits and logic circuits) where devices may be OFF during irradiation and subsequently required to turn ON. The Darlington circuits utilized in typical power-inverters prolong the annealing, if OFF when exposed. The propagation delay of a NAND gate series pair is increased considerably at early times after a neutron exposure. This additional delay can result in reduced pulse width or lost pulses."
"In the past, Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) circuits have been unsuitable for many aerospace applications because of their sensitivity to permanent and transient radiation effects. Radiation test data on hardened p-channel MOS (PMOS) transistors now show that most permanent radiation damage can be prevented in PMOS circuits. Also, hardened PMOS transistors and circuits have been built utilizing a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) isolation technique to minimize transient radiation effects. Analyses of dynamic and static PMOS/SOS NOR gates show that, with the electrical and radiation-hardness characteristics already attained in discrete transistors, the following circuit performance levels can be expected. Dynamic PMOS/SOS circuits will operate at 5 MHz clock rates and 112 μW/ gate power levels and will tolerate radiation levels above 107 rads(Si), 1015 n/cm2, and 109 rads(Si)/sec. Static circuits will exhibit logic delays of about 30 ns/gate at power levels of 0.37 mW/gate and will also tolerate radiation levels above 107 rads(Si), 1015 n/cm2 and 109 rads(Si)/sec. These performance and radiation hardness characteristics appear to be achievable for large-scale-integration (LSI) of PMOS/SOS circuits, utilizing commercially-proven process techniques."
"This paper presents the results of a comprehensive modeling and radiation effects study of a p-channel enhancement mode LSI/MOS test chip (TC) specifically designed to allow measurement of discrete device type parameters and responses for circuits constructed from similar devices on a common chip. Particular emphasis was given to the development of accurate models of the individual devices and to the demonstration of the use of these models in predicting the radiation responses of the circuits on the chip. Ionization dose and neutron effects were determined for each of the parameters used in the model which contained the basic Sah equations modified to include channel length modulation effects, the body effect, and the electric-field-dependence of channel mobility. Average values of these parameters were then used in predictions of pre- and post-radiation responses for circuits."
"A review of radiation damage processes in MgO and MgF2 is presented. The damage processes are discussed in terms of their efficiency and energy dependence. The damage process in MgF2 is due to radiolysis which is a much more efficient process than that due to elastic collisions between the incident radiation and the lattice ions. The latter process is dominant in MgO and ZnO and radiolysis apparently does not occur in these materials."
"Experimental evidence is given which indicates that the yield of charge carriers excited by a given dose of x-rays in thin films of poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVK) is dominated by geminate (initial) recombination of the ion pairs. The yield as a function of applied field gives a very good fit to the theory of initial recombination developed for gases by Onsager. Two competing mechanisms, the Poole-Frenkel effect and track recombination, may be rejected on the basis of the field dependence. A comparison of the charge transients in PVK with other organic materials is given along with a discussion of the possibility of trap modulation of the mobility in PVK. The role of three different kinds of carrier recombination, bulk, track and geminate, is described in terms of the experimental results expected for each of them."
"Transient ionizing radiation effects data on six types of MOS/LSI devices are presented considering variations in the pulse width of the radiation environment and circuit design of the MOS/ LSI cell. Four of the device types employed dynamic logic cells and the other two were formed with static logic cells. Transient failure levels of the dynamic arrays occurred with exposure to a total radiation dose of 1-10 rads(Si) through a time as long as 5 ms. The static logic arrays demonstrated significant transient responses at radiation levels of 108 rads(Si)/s, or transient failure of stored information with exposure to a total radiation dose of 10-50 rads(Si)."
 "Results of experiments on silicon diodes with a range of breakdown voltages from 5.7 to 85 volts are presented for ionizing dose rates from 107 to 8x109 rads/s for a wide variety of bias conditions near and in avalanche breakdown. Results of experiments to determine the effectiveness of various hardening techniques are also presented. The transient response of especially designed neutron hardened, temperature compensated, voltage reference diodes are determined, for the purpose of evaluating the consistency of permanent neutron and transient ionizing hardening techniques. The effect of the temperature compensating junction for OTC diodes on transient current is presented and the transient response of voltage regulating diodes is evaluated as a function of the circuit providing bias current to the diode as well as the impedance of the circuit that the reference diode drives. A model that is appropriate to diodes operating in avalanche breakdown and in an ionizing radiation environment is also presented."
"An instrumentation and data reduction technique for the routine analysis of dielectric photoconductivity data has been developed. This technique provides detailed conductivity versus time data during and shortly after an ionizing radiation pulse. Thus, it complements the timeintegral of conductivity technique, which can provide good long-term delayed conductivity data, and it offers some advantages over similar methods developed to measure conductivity. The unique features of this technique include the use of spline functions in the data reduction, the use of a sample designed to provide noise current cancellation, and circuit analysis that includes a mismatched transmission line."
"A method was developed to determine experimentally the generation rate conversion factor, go (electron-hole pairs/m3-rad), using a pulse of ionizing radiation of arbitrary shape. The method involves measuring the photocurrent response of a p-n or Schottky barrier diode as a function of the applied reverse-bias voltage to the diode. The slope of the peak ph tocurrent versus (Vbi + VR)1/2 curve is used to calculate the value of go. The method was applied to Si, GaAs, and GaAs0.5P0.5 Schottky barrier diodes. The experimentally determined values were within ±7.5 percent of the accepted values in the case of silicon and gallium arsenide. The value of go for GaAs0.5P0.5 was found to be 7.45 × 1019 electron-hole pairs/m3-rad."
"Following a brief discussion of the operating characteristics of light emitting diodes (LED's), radiation effects in these devices are reviewed. Recent results on neutron damage effects in SiC LED's are also presented. Based on this review, criteria are developed for radiation insensitivity of LED's."
"A comprehensive study of transient radiation response mechanisms in Junction Field Effect Transistors at dose rates less than 1 × 1010 Rad (si)/sec has been performed. Theoretical models of device response have been developed and represented in terms of a large signal equivalent circuit model. Experimental verification has been achieved through radiation testing at the AFCRL Linac Facility on specially built JFETs supplied by Siliconix, Inc. The complete results of the work are documented in Reference 1, and the conclusions are presented in this paper."
"Calculations are presented for a bipolar transistor which indicate the relative importance of the device regions in establishing the neutron tolerance. For conventionally diffused profiles with a fixed set of device parameters, the calculations indicate that an optimum base width may occur which will yield the maximum neutron hardness. The analysis indicates that the neutron hardness can be increased substantially by using a device profile with a shallow, abrupt emitter and a narrow base region. Devices utilizing these criteria are extremely tolerant to neutron irradiation and show a current gain greater than 10 after a neutron fluence of 1016 n/cm2 (E > 10 keV). This represents an order of magnitude increase in hardness over devices presently available."
"A method is present which systematically uses multiple linear regression to predict the current gain response of bipolar transistors to gamma and neutron radiation both separately and collectively. The results indicated that the important parameters needed to predict the radiation response can be statistically determined from a large number of parameters provided those needed for predictions are included in this set. To predict neutron response only pre-rad electrical measurements were needed; while to predict the response to gamma radiation, electrical measurements after some initial gamma irradiation was required. The response to the total neutron and gamma environment was predicted assuming that the increases in base currents due to the environments separately were independent of each other."
"Results of an investigation of the transient and permanent effects of ionizing radiation on Al2O3-CdSe thin-film transistors and microcircuits are reported. The total-gamma-dose response of the devices did not differ significantly from that of conventional silicon MOS devices, and the observed shift in threshold voltage is consistent with a positive charge buildup in the gate oxide. In transient response studies, it was found that the thin-film devices will perform without failure up to peak dose rates of ~1010 rads(Si)/s (~30 ns pulsewidth)."
"The Step-Recovery Diode (SRD) frequency multiplier has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. The results show that the multiplier is quite susceptible to neutron damage if self-bias is used (which is usually the case), and it is recommended either that the preradiation lifetime should be deliberately shortened or that voltage bias be considered in a radiation environment. The self-bias problem is found to be due to an increase in recombination current brought on by a reduction in minority carrier lifetime with neutron fluence. This study also derives the ultimate failure fluence as a function of multiplier parameters for these multipliers in general."
"Damage and recovery characteristics were measured on lithium-containing solar cells irradiated by 1-MeV electrons. Empirical expressions for cell recovery time, diffusion-length damage coefficient immediately after irradiation, and diffusion-length damage coefficient after recovery were derived using results of short-circuit current, diffusion-length, and reverse-bias capacitance measurements. The damage coefficients were expressed in terms of a single lithium density parameter, the lithium gradient. A fluence dependence was also established, this dependence being the same for both the immediate-post-irradiation and post-recovery cases. Cell recovery rates were found to increase linearly with lithium gradient and vary approximately as ø-0.59."
"The effects of fast neutron damage on diffused GaAs laser diodes have been studied by observing the pre- and post-irradiation current-voltage characteristics and electroluminescence (EL) spectra at several temperatures between 75°K and 300°K. The pre-irradiation diode current at high temperature is dominated by nonradiative space-charge region recombination. The principal emission band at 300°K results from band-to-acceptor recombination in the p-region. A secondary band at 1.28 eV occurs via donor-acceptor pair recombination in the depletion region. At low temperature the dominant diode current flow is by nonradiative tunneling while the principal emission band contains radiative tunneling and band-filling components. Neutron irradiation increases the constant-voltage diode current. The additional current is due to space-charge region recombination (SC) at high temperatures and both SC and tunneling at low temperatures. The room-temperature damage constant is somewhat larger than that found in epitaxial GaAs laser diodes and in silicon p+n diodes. The constant-voltage principal emission band intensity decreases with fluence at a rate such that the resultant damage constant is about half that of the SC current damage constant. Irradiation to a fluence of 1.8 × 1015 n/cm2 (> 10 keV) has no effect on the constant-voltage secondary emission band intensity."
"This paper presents and discusses experimental means for identifying the sources of neutron-induced base current in bipolar transistors. Several examples illustrate the predominant determinants of post-irradiation current gain, and the methods facilitate intercomparison of disparate devices. The techniques cited are equally applicable to the study of current-gain and recombination in unirradiated devices."
"Using Hauser's equation for the current dependence of effective emitter area in Hahn's epitaxial transistor model, it is predicted that emitter debiasing appreciably increases the equilibrium collector resistance of a transistor having a structure typical of neutron-hardened transistors. To experimentally determine whether debiasing is as severe as predicted, a small transistor and an adjacent emitter-shaped resistor were fabricated on the same chip. Near coincidence of the emitter-shaped resistor I-V characteristic with the transistor saturation locus, before and after irradiation to neutron fluences up to 5× 1014 n/cm2 (E > 10 KeV), demonstrates that emitter debiasing is not important in determining the saturation locus (onset of hFE falloff with collector current) in transistors having a moderate emitter stripe width (2 mils). It is concluded that extremely narrow emitter stripe widths are not needed for neutron-hardened transistors."
"Experimental data on the responses of matched silicon JFET's subjected to neutron burst, neutron steady-state, and pulsed gamma radiation are presented. Temporary and permanent degradation of device parameters and their change of matching parameters as functions of neutron fluence and ionizing dose rate are discussed. A procedure for selection of matched JFET pairs is suggested. An existing method for calculating the degradation of gm was found to be useful but required a slight modification to fit experimental data."
"Bipolar-transistor noise current and noise voltage were examined in the range from 100 Hz to 20 kHz as a function of γ-dose from γ= 105 Rad)Si) to γ = 1.1 × 107 Rad(Si). A variety of geometries of both NPN and PNP types were utilized. Substantial changes in inT were found for all device types but vnT changed in only certain device types."
"The small signal capacitance-voltage characteristics of neutron irradiated p+ nn+ and n+ pp+ diodes are described. The capacitance characteristics were measured at frequencies of 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz for five neutron fluences. A qualitative difference in the effect of neutron fluence on the capacitance characteristics of p+ nn+ and n+ pp+ diodes is described. A computer aided device model which is based on an equivalent circuit representation of two deep defect levels is described. The capacitance characteristics of neutron irradiated pR+ nn+ diodes with three different pre-radiation resistivities were computed using the device model representation of two deep acceptor levels. The computed curves are in good agreement with the measured characteristics."
"An entirely new bridge circuit for the measurement of the junction transistors total propagation delay time is described. Unlike previous methods, this bridge is calibrated in time units and thus it provides a direct readout of delay time. An experiment to evaluate the bridge as a one-test acceptance screening tool in neutron hardness assurance programs is described. Finally, a very brief discussion of propagation delay time and its interpretation is presented as an appendix."
"The microwave PiN diode and its associated circuitry have been studied both experimentally and theoretically. The results of the study show that microwave PIN switches are very susceptible to permanent neutron damage. The failure mechanism is a severe reduction of conductivity modulation in the diode's I region caused by a reduction of carrier lifetime. This loss of conductivity modulation not only causes a reduction of the isolation abilities of a microwave switch but is also shown to lead to other secondary failure modes which can be extremely important."
"Recent studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on microwave Gunn oscillators have neglected the effect of the ionizing radiation on the gas inside the microwave cavities used as part of the oscillator circuit. This paper shows both theoretically and experimentally that this effect cannot be neglected above dose rates of 108 Rad/ sec."
"A group of seven different types of medium scale integrated circuits (MSI) were tested at dose rates from 109 to 1012 Rad (Si)/s. These included five types of bipolar circuits and two types of MOS circuits. Catastrophic failures were encountered in two types of bipolar circuits and one type of MOS circuit. Radiation response of all circuits is described in the following paper."
"The solar flare, galactic, and magnetically trapped (Van Allen) nuclear particle radiation environments expected on three outer planet \"Grand Tour\" missions have been calculated. The missions are the 1977 4-planet mission (Jupiter - Saturn - Uranus - Neptune), the 1977 3-planet mission (Jupiter - Saturn - Pluto), and the 1979 3-planet mission (Jupiter - Uranus - Neptune). The planetary Van Allen belts contribute the largest doses behind 1 gm/cm2 shielding of aluminum. For the 1977 4-planet mission, which passes within 2.6 planet radii of Saturn, Saturn's Van Allen belts may contribute as much as 95% of the total dose of 5300 rads. For the 1977 3-planet mission, which passes within 4.3 planet radii of Jupiter, Jupiter's Van Allen belts contribute 90% of the calculated total dose of 1900 rads. The 1979 3-planet mission dose of 600 rads is due to approximately equal contributions of solar flare particles, galactic (cosmic ray) particles, and Jupiter's Van Allen belts (periapsis at 6.7 Jupiter radii)."

"Electrocutaneous stimulation has been investigated for use in the Optacon, a new reading aid for the blind. Results indicate that electrocutaneous stimulation is not practical as a replacement for tactile stimulation, which is presently being used."
"An ultrasound system using moving target indicator (MTI) techniques has been developed to provide a different approach to the problem of isolating and presenting echo information arising from dynamic tissue interfaces. The basic MTI procedure accomplishes isolation of moving target information by comparing echo information subsequent to a transmit pulse to the echo information arising from the preceding pulse. Stationary target information is effectively eliminated. In addition, the MTI procedure isolates dynamic target information throughout the volume investigated by the ultrasonic transducer. This feature eliminates the need for rangegating."
"Since the inception of electroencephalography (EEG), several devices have been built that make brain waves audible; they are known as electroencephalophones (EEP). None has so far taken advantage of the human binaural hearing capability. The system described here presents an effective stereophonic display of four channels of EEG, each from one quadrant of the skull. The signals from the two front quadrants are represented by a single tone whose pitch varies about a center frequency of 1250 Hz and which appears to move laterally in auditory space. The signals from the two occipital quadrants are similarly represented about center frequency of 700 Hz, so that they are readily distinguished from frontal activity. All channels are played through a single pair of headphones. The left headphone represents the combined activity of the two left-hand quadrants; the right headphone, of the two right-hand quadrants. The scheme may be used to supplement conventional graphic EEG records; under special conditions (e. g., routine monitoring, sleep research, training,) it may replace them altogether. Moreover, it may be adapted to vector electrocardiography (EKG) and even to the presentation of signals other than physiological, for instance in seismography."
"A common method of initially processing surface-detected electromographic (EMG) activity is to differentially amplify, rectify, and then smooth (using a low-pass filter) the rectified activity. The output of the filter exhibits a mean value slightly obscured by ripple. Both the mean value and ripple increase with increasing muscle contraction. The mean value can be called the signal while the ripple, undesirable when only the signal is desired, can be called noise. The SNR depends, at least, upon the contraction level, type of smoothing filter, and the amount of smoothing for the particular filter. This defined SNR is important in signal communication problems of both a design and a theoretical nature."
"The average visual evoked potential in man is found to be characterized by six major potential waves or deflections. A computer-aided visual inspection technique is used to extract and measure the 12 parameters corresponding to the amplitude and latency of the six peaks from the responses of 50 subjects. It is then demonstrated that each of these parameters is approximately individually Gaussian distributed and their means and variances are found. With this information, a simple statistical model for the normal visual evoked potential is constructed. It is next assumed that the same 12 parameters are jointly Gaussian distributed and the correlation matrix is computed. A principal components analysis is then applied to this matrix and it is found that the 12 correlated visual evoked potential parameters can be transformed into a reduced set of four uncorrelated components accounting for approximately 76 percent of the total variance of the original set. The four components are then rotated using a varimax technique and the correlation between these components and the original 12 parameters is found to reveal some interesting aspects of the visual evoked potential (VEP) pattern behavior."
"A numerical procedure that shows promise as a parameter-identifying scheme is presented. The procedure is simple enough to allow real-time analysis on a small high-speed computer. Results of application to simulated and real blood-pressure curves are presented and discussed."
"The change in mutual impedance ΔZ resulting from a change Δg in the conductivity of a particular region of a volume conductor is shown to be given by ΔZ = - Δg∫Ltø·L003C8; dv. Lø and Lψ are the lead fields associated with the two ports used to measure ΔZ. The integration is over the region where the conductivity has changed. The superscript t indicates that the lead field is to be evaluated following the change in conductivity. An example involving a spherical conductor is provided."
"The resistance of the urinary bladder, as measured between two electrodes attached to the external bladder wall at frequencies above 100 kHz, is proportional to the bladder volume for properly placed electrodes. The feasibility of using an oscillator, the frequency of which is controlled by the bladder interelectrode resistance, to provide an electrical signal proportional to bladder volume for use in connection with an electronic bladder stimulator is presented. The implications of this result are discussed."
"A left-ventricular pumping model based on a left-ventricular systolic time-varying pressure/volume ratio e(t) has been proposed on the basis of the physiological studies indicating that the parameter e(t) is a function of time in systole, almost independent from left-ventricular volume and the arterial-loading conditions, and is a good index of myocardial inotropism. The model has been formulated by the following two equations: \\begin{equation} p(t) = e(t) { v(0)- ∫t<\\sup>0 - i(t)dt} \\end{equation} \\begin{equation}p(t) = f{i(t)} \\end{equation} where p(t) is the systolic left-ventricular pressure, v(o) is the left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (at the onset of systole), i(t) is the blood-flow rate ejected from the left ventricle, t is the time from the onset of systole, and f is a function of the hydraulic impedance of the load against the ventricular ejection (including the aortic valve). Some theoretical analyses of this model are attempted, first analytically with simplifications of the time course of e(t) and the hydraulic impedance of the load, and then by an analog computer with e(t) approximated to the physiological data. Quantitative relationships among various hemodynamic parameters are obtained, and these appear to be in good agreement with the physiological characteristics of the left ventricle."
"Recordings of arterial pulse waves often appear on a rising or falling baseline. This causes a shift in the position of the pulse-wave foot as compared to its position on the horizontal base-line. The magnitude of this shift is unknown. Workers therefore tend to disregard pulse-wave recordings with sloping baselines when measuring foot-to-foot pulse-wave velocities. A formula was derived that allows an estimation of the upper limit of the shift in the position of the pulse-wave foot to be tm = l000n/157 ms, where n = b/A, b is the slope of the baseline, and A is one-half the arterial pulse-wave amplitude. In the majority of recordings with sloping baselines, n < 0.5 and tm does therefore not exceed 3 ms. Compared to the measured foot-to-foot time intervals, tm is usually small enough to be disregarded. In cases where n is larger, the formula can be used to estimate the upper limit of the error caused by the sloping base-line."
"An instrumentation scheme for performing computerized heart catheterization has been developed. Objectives in the development were 1) low cost, 2) stability, 3) reliability, and 4) simplicity of operation. These objectives were achieved by using integrated-circuit operational-amplifier techniques coupled with simplified noninteractive controls. Use of the equipment in four hospitals over the past four years on over 1500 catheterizations has shown it to be ideal for heart catheterizations and other clinical and experimental settings where cardiovascular measurements are made."
"There is a need in medical and physiological instrumentation for a system that can automatically correct baseline shifts. Some cases where this need arises are discussed. A self-balancing system that can be used as a general-purpose unit has been developed and is described. It consists of a binary counter, a digital to analog converter, and logic circuits. The described system automatically balances dc shifts in signals with a range of 6 V. Balancing time is less than 15 ms. The system is designed to work with tape or chart recorders with input range of ± 1 to ± 3 V. Some design parameters of this system are discussed briefly."

  "The operation of the Lexiphone, a reading machine for the blind, is described. The Lexiphone produces a sound pattern for each of the alphabet symbols, and the blind reader has to learn to associate each of these patterns with the corresponding letter. With practice, whole words and short phrases are recognized as entities. As the Lexiphone machine reads each line of print by scanning it with a column containing a large number of photodiodes (54), the visual resolution is quite high and the equivalent quantizing noise is low The signals from the photocells are processed by digital circuits to. produce the modulating signals of a single square wave. The square wave is modulated both in frequency and amplitude, the frequency component being the chief one to identify the letter, and the code sounds generated by the machine reported to be quite pleasant. The physical construction of the Lexiphone is robust and a description of the machine is given. The reading speed of the Lexiphone is discussed. Experiments indicate that a reading speed of over 30 words a minute including line change can be attained with 200 h of training (over a year). A method of dichotic presentation has been proposed to increase the reading speed and preliminary experiments have produced encouraging results."
"It is well known that the almost lossless transmission of light through normal mammalian corneas, an obvious fact, requires a theoretical explanation. The reason for this is the pronounced scattering one would expect if the spatial arrangement of the large number of long transversely submicroscopic fibrils that exist in the stroma were purely random. In a recent theory it was shown that the high corneal transparency can be quantitatively well explained if the fibril arrangement can be described in terms of distorted lattices. One conclusion of this theory is that the ratio of scattered light intensity to incident light intensity in the stroma should be inversely proportional to the fifth power of the light wavelength. In the present work this ratio has been measured for 12 rabbit corneas as a function of the wavelength in the range 3900 to 7250 Å. The results are in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction."
"Twenty normal clinical tonographic traces were averaged and compared at 10-s intervals by means of two systems: 1) the decay curves of a linear viscoelastic mathematical model having a single degree of freedom, and 2) nonlinear elastic models, including the classical (or current) Grant model. The linear viscoelastic model provided a considerably better match than the other models. So far as degree of match and facility of outflow values were concerned, the study showed the effect on the models of various investigators' formulations of ocular rigidity, corneal indentation, and tonometer calibration. In precise work facility of outflow values should be reported only if a measure of the degree of fit to the tonogram is given."
"Telethermocoagulation is a neurosurgical technique that is now entering the phase of practical clinical application. In this system brain lesions are produced by heating implanted metallics by an external RF electromagnetic field."
"A flexible collapsible catheter gauge that can be introduced into an artery through a French 7 catheter is described. It expands when entering a wide blood vessel or tubular organ and the degree of expansion is measured by electromagnetic induction. The sensor consists of two collapsible congruent wire loops, one of which acts as the primary and the other one as the secondary of a transformer. The output of the secondary varies as the logarithm of the artery diameter over a wide range. Variations as small as 0.01 mm in a 10-mm-diameter lumen can be recorded. The paper describes construction of the probe and presents examples of nonradiographic measurement of arterial diameters as well as of recording of pulsatile changes in artery diameter in dogs."
"This paper describes several studies that contribute to an understanding of the ways in which inhomogeneities and anisotropies may contribute to the formation of multiple peaks of potential on the body surface."
"This paper considers how many and which locations on the body surface must be measured (by taking ECGs at these positions) to be able to determine consistently the total-body QRS surface-potential distribution as it varies in time. The answers to these questions have implications about the complexity of models of heart electrical activity in addition to their experimental value. An advantage of using the ability to compute the total-body potential distribution as a criterion of quality is that untestable assumptions about the nature of heart electrical activity are avoided. The accuracy of computed potential distributions with respect to corresponding experimental ones is specified by the mean-square difference between them. Acceptable maps had an average relative mean square error of less than 4 percent in the presence of about 1 percent noise, since inspection of the surface maps showed this to be the maximum error allowable for the same clinical or physiological interpretation of the surface maps analyzed."
"An experimental technique is described for measuring the equivalent multipole model for isolated beating hearts. The dipole, quadripole, and octapole moments are measured from weighted sums of 20 electrode potentials on the surface of a 6.35-cm diameter sphere. An iterative procedure is used to eliminate the effects of source eccentricity for dipolar data."
"A specialized facility, using automatic techniques, has been developed to facilitate the relatively complex and very time-consuming procedures involved in comprehensive physiological monitoring and routine treatment of critically ill patients. This unit, which is provided with a medium-size digital computer system, is operated by an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, technicians, engineers and computer scientists."
"An instrument for real-time separation of interleaved neuronal spike trains has been developed. Amplitude of the spike at two selectable time points provides the criteria for separating spikes into as many as nine different classes. The amplitude-time windows are displayed on an oscilloscope along with the spike for adjustment purposes. The system is mainly constructed with integrated circuits for low cost and ease of fabrication."

"A model of the mammalian muscle spindle having three distinct parts is proposed. The three parts, which consist of a mechanical filter, a transducer, and an encoder, are closely related with their physiological counterparts. A study of the generator potentials for the primary and secondary endings of the spindle was performed by means of an analog computer simulation of the model. The afferent responses of the spindle under a phasic stretch with and without fusimotor fibers simulation are also studied. Finally, frequencygrams (see text) are obtained under the condition of γ1 (dynamic) stimulation acting on both nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers. The model yields results that are directly comparable with physiological data obtained under similar conditions."
"An important parameter in the design of countercurrent dialyzers is the permeability of the membrane which separates the blood and dialyzate. In this paper, methods of optimization theory are applied to specify membrane permeability along the length of a countercurrent dialyzer operating under quasi-static conditions. Two optimization problems are considered. In the first the performance functional is a quadratic measure of membrane complexity; in the second it includes also a quadratic measure of the deviation of the blood output concentration from a desired (low) level. For both situations it is shown that the optimal membrane is one of constant permeability along its length, a result which is intuitively appealing and has an obvious economic consequence. Formulas for computing the optimal permeabilities are given, and some problems for future research in this area are outlined. A generalization of the principal result is also included, and some deficiencies in the present analysis are discussed."
"During the past 15 years, many models have been developed for the pupillary light reflex system. Some of these models have been inadequately described while others have never been tested to determine their compliance or noncompliance with known experimental data. This paper reviews the major experimental and modeling advances that assisted in understanding the basic operation of the pupillary light reflex system."
"The operation of liquid ion exchanger microelectrodes that allows measurement of internal potassium and chloride activities in identifiable neurons has been described. A computer that solves the logarithmic equation necessary for computation of these activities has been constructed and tested successfully. The great value of the computer is that it permits continuous measurement of these activities. When the internal ion activities change, such continuous measurement allows calculation of potassium and chloride permeabilities in single neurons."
"Timers used for the generation of long sequences of pulses have employed serial counting techniques. A system of parallel counting chains, each capable of independent operation in a variety of modes and having programmable clock signals, can be used to generate long sequences of pulses and act as event counters or timedelay devices."
"Experimentation regarding various aspects of a technique for recording electrocardiographic potentials from unprepared skin, without the use of conventional paste, is described. Because of the relatively high skin-to-electrode impedances encountered without electrolytic paste, high input impedance amplifiers must be utilized for acquisition of the signal. In order to minimize susceptibility to external electrostatic and electromagnetic interference, an inherent problem with high input impedance amplifiers, buffer amplifiers were incorporated directly within the electrode housing. Of the different metals tested, stainless steel proved to be the most stable skin contact material for pasteless operation. The integrated electrode-buffer amplifiers described comply with specifications of the American Heart Association and should prove useful as a direct replacement for conventional paste-type electrodes in existing clinical EKG equipment as well as for long-term applications such as space missions and intensive-care-unit patient monitoring, where frequent attention to the electrodes is inconvenient."
"Digital preprocessors can ease the increasing data collection demands placed on real-time computers in patient monitoring. This paper describes a preprocessor that detects in real time an electrocardiogram QRS complex and computes the R-R interval. Detection is performed using multiple digital differentiation, which is encouraging as an ultrareliable means for locating the QRS. Inherent in the technique is a dependable control that can automatically compensate for signal-level variations. Clinical data demonstrate that detection is insensitive to low- and high-frequency noise, from baseline drift to muscle artifact and cautery bursts. The device can be connected directly to a patient, whose safety is guaranteed by optoelectronic isolation and interelectrode current limiting. Preprocessor operation has been human-engineered to a simple on/off procedure."

"A number of experimental inquiries are presently in progress in the field of Neurosurgery where ac and dc magnetic fields have been utilized to advance the therapy of neurologic disease. A Conference on Neuromagnetics was organized by the Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital, to bring together scientists, engineers, and neurosurgeons to survey the present state of the art. From the following summary of the proceedings, it is apparent that the present major interests lie in controlled noncommunicating methods of producing brain lesions, the control and heating of microparticles within the cerebro-vascular system, and the external control of intra-arterial catheters. Also reviewed are presentations in basic magnetics, induction heating, and metallurgy. There is good reason to believe that some of the techniques described will have significant application in clinical therapeutics."
"``The Technology of Automated Multiphasic Health Testing (AMHT)'' was examined in Davos, Switzerland, during September 14-18, 1970, at the first international conference supported by the Engineering Foundation. The 159 conference members from 14 different nations discussed AMHT on the basis of its involvement in the use of automated laboratory equipment and medical instruments in combination with computers to provide numerous accurate and reliable tests as well as other procedures to a large number of people with a minimum of highly trained personnel. Topics covered in the plenary sessions included ``AMHT in Perspective,'' ``Recent Progress in AMHT,'' ``Utilizing AMHT in Developing Countries,'' ``The Role of the Engineer in AMHT,'' ``AMHT in Patient Surveillance and Patient Management,'' ``How to Organize and Operate an AMHT Facility,'' and ``Device Safety.'' A special session was presented on ``Clinical Chemistry.'' Evening workshops were held on ``Quantitative Neurological Evaluation,'' ``The Role of the Engineer in AMHT,'' ``Trend Detection in Cardiology,'' ``Automatic Cytology,'' and ``Blood Chemistry Measurements-New Approaches to Automation.'' Conference proceedings will be published by the Engineering Foundation."

"The ultrasonic threshold doses (acoustic intensity and time duration of a single pulse) to produce functional and structural irreversible effects in the mouse, rat, cat, monkey, and human central nervous systems are presented for a wide range of the pertinent parameters. There does not appear to be an important dependence upon frequency in the range from 1 to 6 MHz. Embryonic tissue is found to be appreciably more sensitive than adult tissue. From considerations of the measured outputs of commercially available ultrasonic diagnostic instruments, the experimentally determined threshold dosages necessary to produce these irreversible effects, and reports of clinical experience, it is concluded that ultrasound does not present a hazard, as currently employed for medical diagnostic purposes."
"A mathematical analysis is made of the changes in body fluid volume and solute composition that occur during hemodialysis. The analysis considers the movement of water and solutes across the dialyzer membrane and between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Dialyzer operating variables such as dialysate addition rate, solute dialysances, and ultrafiltration rate are included. The output of the mathematical model agrees well with data obtained during clinical dialysis. The results of the analysis indicate that the intracellular volume changes that would be expected during dialysis as a result of osmotic gradients are very small. The effects on solute removal of varying dialysate addition rate, ultrafiltration rate, and dialysance are analyzed."
"In systems in which inductive coupling between a pancake-shaped coil on the surface of the body and a similar coil within the body is utilized for the transport of electromagnetic energy, the minimization of temperature rise in the tissue is intimately related to the achievement of minimum losses in the region of the implanted coil. A detailed theoretical analysis indicates the design considerations for achieving minimum losses in the vicinity of the implanted coil and predicts relevant internal losses of about one-half of 1 percent of the transported power. Experimental verification of theoretical expectations has involved an operating frequency of 428 kHz for the transmission of 1 kW of power between a simple water-cooled coil on the surface of the chest and a coil implanted in the chest wall of a dog. A maximum tissue temperature of 103.5° F was observed. Since 1-h operation per day at the 1-kW level would supply the anticipated energy requirements for a patient with an artificial heart, the system may find application in the charging of internal energy storage units of artificial heart systems."
"Techniques for reflex simulation as a treatment for the neurologically impaired bladder must restore volitional control of bladder function. This paper outlines the engineering commitments necessitated by biological considerations and the exclusive biological problems that must be dealt with in order to accomplish this. An electromechanical system that includes patient controllable mechanisms to provide for retention of intravesical content interrupted by intermittent expulsion is then described."
"A system is described for decoding frequency-modulated magnetic tape data directly into digital form suitable for input to a digital computer. Included in the system is a very precise method used to compensate for flutter errors. The bypassing of standard demodulation, filtering, and analog-to-digital conversion permits a significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This type of system is most advantageous when reproducing data from magnetic decks whose signal-to-noise ratios cannot be reliably expected to remain at a satisfactory level. Using electrocardiograms, it has been demonstrated that a real gain in the detection of low-amplitude waveforms can be achieved with this system as compared to conventional reproducing."
 "A simply constructed and inexpensive amplifier that exhibits unusually low noise is described. The amplifier is particularly useful in applications which call for large amplifications of very low- level signals. When variable gain and filtering stages are added, the amplifier provides flexibility, convenience, and performance comparable to the finest commercial units."
"A circuit which has low gain for small signals and high gain for larger signals and which improves the signal-to-noise ratio of nerve impulse sequences is described."

"A new solid-state battery, designed for implantable prosthetics is described. Single cell voltage is 2.8 V. The anode is metallic lithium. The cathode is a proprietary iodide. The electrolyte is a crystal, lithium iodide. Cell impedance at 37°C for a typical pacemaker battery is under 1000Ω at beginning of life (BOL) and 16 000 Ω at end of life (EOL). The simple chemistry of the cell precludes hydrogen gas generation and thus, for the first time, permits hermetic sealing of a battery and/or pacemaker in a welded stainless-steel enclosure which may be used as the indifferent anode electrode in a monopolar system."
"The present value of telemetry in clinical care is limited. In ten years, however, it is possible that 40 patients will be under surveillance by telemetry at any one time in a 1000 bed hospital, with at least three channels of information associated with each patient. The technological base for broad medical use of telemetry exists already except for the serious lack of practical transducers. The real problems in implementing a telemetry program are electromagnetic interference, standardization, maintenance, security of components, location of patients, and reliability of day-to-day operation. It is urged that preferential consideration be given to manufacturers who recognize these problems and offer realistic proposals for their solution."
"An optimally controlled respirator was developed. It has three main features: 1) ventilation is controlled by the patient's metabolic rate from continuously measured C02 output, 2) physiologic dead space approximated as a linear function of tidal volume is used to estimate alveolar ventilation, and 3) respiratory rate is computed to minimize ventilatory work."
"The spontaneous fluctuations of voltage across a glass microelectrode have been studied as a function of the average difference in voltage (V) across the electrode and the concentration of internal (n2) and external (n1) salt solutions. A stationary fluctuation was observed, with a mean square value many times greater than that calculated from the Nyquist formula for noise due to the thermal agitation of charge, for all states of the electrode except n2=n1, V=0. Here the fluctuations equal the Johnson level. The spectral density of the fluctuation and its dependence on (n1, n2, V) are given in the range 3-0.003 MKCl and V = ±200 mV. The dependence on the species of cation (potassium and sodium) was also determined. The work has practical implications for users of microelectrodes who wish to minimize noise. It also serves as a model for studying noise generated when ions move through a micropore."
"The development of a practical power transmission system for a rechargeable artificial heart requires not only a means of efficiently coupling the required electromagnetic energy across the skin, but also a charge regulator, a primary cooling loop, and a suspension system for aligning the cores. This paper describes a tuned transcutaneous transformer which utilizes ferrite pot cores with Litz windings. Typically, the transformer operates over a frequency range from 12 to 20 kHz. Power levels of 150 W into a 16-Ω load have been demonstrated in vivo."
"An adaptive method for detecting change in digitized cardiotachometer recordings has been developed which takes into account the nonstationary statistical structure of the data. The digitized data are smoothed to reduce the variance at high frequencies caused by discontinuities inherent in cardiotachometer output. Based on a first-order autoregression, which has been shown to be appropriate for heart rate data, the adaptive procedure uses estimates of the parameters which are most influenced by the recent observations. Decreasing weight is given to past prestimulus data, and the estimates are updated with each stimulus. A test for change is then applied to the poststimulus regions at each time point, yielding a t statistic. The t2's can then be averaged to give a test for change over an interval."
"Simple circuits performing oscillation-frequency modulation functions using one active device and p-n junction type varactors are studied. The performance of the common circuit is analyzed. Equations are derived to determine signal-to-frequency deviation, transducer gain, frequency deviation, input impedance, distortion, maximum signal, noise and signal sensitivity, dynamic range, and maximum resolution. The upper or lower bounds of these quantities are given as functions of the varactor parameters and circuit constants."
"A system for the measurement of velocity of particles suspended in liquids was developed, based on the on-line computation of the time to maximum cross correlation between the optical signatures made by particles, as their image traverses two adjacent photo-detectors aligned in the direction of flow. Cross correlation computation is performed with a commercially available computer, and the time to maximum cross correlation is detected by digital pulse circuitry. The system is particularly suited for measurements of blood flow in vivo and in vitro. Frequency response is linear to 1 Hz where the phase lag is 30°."
"An instrument which measures maximally forced expiratory airflow directly, computes its integral (lung volume decrement ), and interrupts the storage oscilloscope display of this flow-volume trajectory at fixed but adjustable intervals of time is described. This new device is portable and does not involve bellows or a water-filled canister."
"A method of obtaining a continuous record of the average center frequency of the EEG and the instantaneous phase fluctuations about that average is described. A phase-locked loop with a wide range phase detector has been implemented on a hybrid computer for this purpose. This new technique provides another way to extract information from the EEG and tends to emphasize the time-varying features of such recordings."
"It is necessary to monitor the physiological state of small animals being maintained under anesthetic. One parameter that may be observed is the respiratory pattern which is particularly important when using anesthetics known to depress respiratory function. A respiration monitor is described which indicates nasal air flow and which has a self-centering feature to eliminate drift. This feature enables the sensitivity of the unit to be increased to allow monitoring from animals with very low tidal volumes. The monitor is small and is battery operated to eliminate line frequency interference of sensitive recording equipment. It gives a meter indication of the respiratory pattern and provides an output suitable for driving a recorder. An audible tone is sounded at each inspiration."
"A circuit for the measurement of biological time intervals from 0.1 ms to 10 s is described. This device accepts biopotentials, stimuli, or transducer signals to produce an instantaneous dc voltage readout proportional to the time between two successive input signals. Digital preconditioning and analog integration are used to simplify the design."

"The feasibility of using brain waves to control an externally powered prosthetic device for amputees was investigated. Two subjects were studied; one normal and one with a right hand disarticulation. Each subject, otherwise at rest, performed the protocol of voluntarily, repetitively opening and closing his hand. The normal accomplished this, while the amputee attempted to use her missing limb as if it were present. The time between opening and the next closing, and between closing and the next opening, was approximately 2 s. Simultaneously with this procedure, electroencephglograms (EEGs) were recorded from scalp electrodes presumably overlying the motor cortex on the left side, and an electromyogram (EMG) was taken from right forearm surface electrodes. The EEG and EMG were recorded on a polygraph and on magnetic tape. The latter recording was later sampled at 128 samples/s and quantized to 210 levels."
"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is the phenomenon by which respiration modulates heart rate in normal humans and in many animals. This investigation was divided into the following three categories: 1) the development of a mathematical model relating respiration to those variations that it causes in heart rate; 2) the use of digital filtering techniques to attenuate fluctuations in heart rate which are due to respiration; and 3) the development of methods that use only heart rate to get information about respiration."
"From 10 560 transthoracic fibrillation-defibrillation episodes in large anesthetized dogs, the effectiveness of 88 types of untruncated and truncated exponential waveforms in reversing ventricular fibrillation was evaluated. The study involved waveforms which could be generated with stored energy levels (in the simple capacitor-switch sense) of 60, 90, 120, and 180 J and initial current levels of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, and 100 A. The 10-A waveforms were untruncated or truncated at final current values of 5, 7.5, and 9 A. The 20-, 30-, and 40-A waveforms were untruncated or truncated at 5, 10, and 15 A. The 60-, 80-, and l00-A waveforms were untruncated or truncated at the 15-A level."
"An optical Doppler velocimeter utilizing optical heterodyning techniques was used to measure radial velocity profiles of pulsatile flow in a cardiovascular circulation model. The light source was a single-mode frequency-stabilized He-Ne CW laser (6328 Å, 0.1 mW). The laser beam was focused to a 30-μm in diameter spot in the flow stream. Polystyrene spheres 0.73 μm in diameter, suspended in distilled water, were used as light scatterers. The optical signal beam contained Doppler-shifted scattered light. The reference beam was split from the source beam in one configuration; in a second configuration an acoustical frequency modulator was installed in the reference beam pathway as part of a directional flow measurement system. The circulation model consisted of an artificial heart, a Windkessel model, a peripheral resistance, a capillary model, a reservoir, and an optical glass window section. The flow test section was positioned by a three-dimensional finely adjustable holder. From 10 to 34 point measurements were obtained to plot one velocity profile, which covered 95 percent of the tube diameter."
"Recent evidence suggests use of electric and magnetic cues as orientational aids to long-distance migration by fishes. A simple laboratory apparatus is described which accurately reproduces the electromagnetic fields an aquatic organism might naturally experience."
"The detection of the presence of a periodic pulse with uncertain pulse rate and low duty cycle is a common biotelemetry problem. Modern phase-lock and correlation techniques have provided more efficient means of making the presence decision than that provided by energy detection methods. A local signal is cross correlated with the input in a phase-locked loop (PLL) to provide phase reference. Upon lock, a local duplicate signal is generated and correlated with the input. A decision threshold operates on the correlator output. The PLL with filter F(s) = (s+a)/s and three appropriate nonlinearities are analyzed for acquisition time and maximum frequency error that will lock."
"The addition of an optional feedback loop to a previously described automatic analog curve reader, which was originally designed for reconversion of EEG ink recordings to electrical form, permits operation of the curve reader as a true line follower, often a more appropriate method for reconversion of polygraphic ink recordings having gradual to moderate slopes."
"Safety has rapidly become a major issue in the hospital environment. Electronic equipment, particularly monitoring apparatus, has modernized clinical procedures, but constitutes a potential danger to patients. A simple isolation adapter is described which can eliminate the shock hazards of existing equipment by breaking the electrical connection between electrode and monitor. Integral current-limiting circuitry protects against component failure within the coupler."
"A high-performance differential preamplifier is described which combines high input impedance, controlled gain, low input noise, and high common-mode rejection."
"An amplifier for an active electrode is described which requires only a two-conductor connecting cable, is current limiting for patient safety, and has essentially unity voltage gain. In addition, the output impedance is lower and the input impedance has more adjustment latitude than is possible with a conventional source follower."

"The high level languages here are simplified programming languages focussing attention on various facilities such as recursion and pushdown stores. They are assumed to have some kind of subroutine facility. The notion of power studied is obtained by treating the programs as presenting functions of variable sub-routines and arguments of arbitrary data type. Languages are exhibited which are capable of expressing all such functions computable in a deterministic way. This result complements previous work of Paterson and this author who showed that certain flow chart languages, which are usually regarded as universal, were not universal in this sense. A simple function (of subroutines) which is inherently nondeterministic and thus not expressible in any of the standard high level programming languages is also exhibited."
"We define the following classes of program schemata: P = class of schemes using a finite number of simple variables PA = class of schemes using simple and subscripted variables (arrays) PR = class of schemes allowing recursive functions PL = class of schemes allowing labels as values Pm = class of schemes allowing a finite number of special markers as values Ppds = class of schemes using pushdown stores With these, we can also discuss for example PAm, the class of schemes allowing arrays, and special markers as values; and PAL the class of schemes allowing arrays, and labels as values. We argue that PA, PR, and PL faithfully represent mechanisms of subscripting, recursion, and labels as values, that are present in many \"real\" programming languages. We show that P ⊂ PR ⊂ PA ≡ PAm ≡ PAL ≡ Ppdsm. Each of the inclusions and equivalences is effective, except for the equivalences concerning PA. For example, given a scheme in PAm an equivalent scheme in PA exists, but we also prove that you cannot (in general) construct it. We conjecture that PAL, PAm, and Ppdsm are indeed \"universal\"."
"Theoretical properties of computer programs have been the object of considerable study in recent years. In this paper we consider the problem of joining - or composing - one program with another. We study basic properties of compositions within a theoretical model for parallel computation which is closely related to parallel program schemata. In particular, we introduce the notion of finishing schemata which have distinguished starting and ending states. A relation between parallel program schemata and finishing schemata is developed which allows one to carry over previous schemata results. Theorems describing closure properties and determinacy are then given for serial, concurrent and iterative composition of finishing schemata."
  "In order to obtain a short fault-detection sequence for a sequential machine, the concept of an easily testable machine is introduced. Such a machine is one which possesses a minimal-length homogeneous distinguishing sequence and requires no transfer sequences in the fault-detection sequence. A design procedure is presented in which an arbitrary machine is embedded in an easily testable machine by adding input lines to the original machine. The procedure also derives a fault-detection sequence for the easily testable machine."
"Universal base functions (UBF's) are defined which are generalizations of universal logic functions. An (n, m, r)-UBF can be implemented as a single module (UBM) with n+m inputs and 1 output. An arbitrary n-variable switching function fn (X) is then realized on the fixed UBM by realizing a suitable set of m r-variable functions with which to drive m inputs of the UBM, the remaining n inputs being driven by X. The fan-in of a UBM for r ≥ 2 is shown to be considerably less than that of a Universal Logic Module (a special case corresponding to r = 1). Specific UBF's are proposed for r = 2 in which m is on the order of 60% of the value obtained by using the UBF defined by the familiar Shannon decomposition formula. This is close to the theoretical lower bound on m. The use of UBM's provides a new way to realize an arbitrary function or set of functions, completely specified or otherwise, by assembling a small number of circuits selected from a small set of standard logic modules of limited fan-in. For the case r = 2, the number of 2-input devices required to drive the m inputs of the UBM is often considerably less than m. DON'T CARES can be used to advantage to reduce this number still further. Realizations based on a UBM (n=6, m=12, r=2) were computed for over 1000 randomly generated completely specified functions grouped, exclusively, into sets of 1,2,3 and 4 output functions. Most (86%) single output functions required no more than 8 2-input devices to drive the 12 control inputs of the UBM, while most (79%) simultaneous realizations of sets of 4 functions required an average of no more than 6 such devices per output function. More detailed results are provided. Array type realizations of UBM's are proposed such that each can itself be built from multiple copies of a rather limited number of submodule types, each with n+2 inputs."
"This paper presents a synthesis method to realize any p-state normal asynchronous sequential circuit A according to an unconventional structure. It consists of two critical-race free S.T.T. normal asynchronous circuits A1 and A2 connected in series, where A1 is realized with L internal variables and A2 with 2 · So internal variables (So = [ log2 p] ). It is shown that L = 1 for circuit A with single inpunt transitions, and that L is equal to the number of input terminals of A for circuit with multiple input transitions. The internal structure of circuit A2 is investigated by using partition algebra. As a result of this investigation it is shown that A2 can always be realized according to a general model with only So feedback paths, each one including a master-slave flip-flop. Using this model and a straigtforward synthesis procedure, any p-state normal asynchronous circuit can therefore be realized by So + L feed-back Paths."
"A rectangular logic array is described which can realize any combinational switching function. Straight-forward analysis and synthesis procedures are described and the realizations of a number of special functions are given. These include threshold functions, parity functions, symmetric functions, and universal logic functions. Other properties of the array which are examined include diagnostic procedures, isolating defective cells, bounds on the array size and possible implementations of the basic cell."
"This paper investigates the properties and utilizations of one- and two-dimensional NAND gate cellular arrays. Both irredundant and redundant one-dimensional cascades are investigated. The cascade's output function is obtained in closed form, and a test and synthesis procedure is developed. Both irredundant and redundant two-dimensional arrays are examined, and an arbitrary two-dimensional array is reduced to a smaller two-row array without loss of generality. It is shown that for i ≫ 1 and n ≫ 1 an i × i + n- 2 array has the same output function as a 2 × n array. An iterative test and synthesis algorithm is presented for the array. It is shown that an arbitrary n-variable switching function may not always be realizable by an array. However, a combination of arrays can always realize an arbitrary switching function. An improved algorithm is provided which realizes an arbitrary n-variable switching function with approximately one-half the number of arrays required by the sum of products method. This is accomplished by expanding the given function with respect to all but (at least) two variables and then absorbing most of the two-variable functions. Other techniques for combining arrays to realize arbitrary switching functions are also presented. The growth rate for arrays is derived and it is shown that, for large n, n2n cells are required to realize an arbitrary n-variable switching function. This growth rate is compared to growth rates for other rectangular arrays. A growth measure is defined which is based not only on the growth rate, but which also includes a measure of cell and wiring complexity."
"Families of languages recognized by multi-head writing finite automata are considered. For n≥1, an n-head writing finite automaton (n-wfa) is a finite state device with n one-way read-write heads on a single input tape. Relationships between families of languages recognized by n-wfa (Wn) and other models (e.g. n-head nonwriting finite automata, linear-bounded automata, and real-time buffer automata) are established. A complexity measure is defined for computations by two-head writing finite automata. This measure is obtained from a sequence which encodes the motion of the two heads. A relationship between complexity classes for 2-wfa and one-tape off-line Turing machines is then derived. Using this relationship, a number of sets are shown to be unrecognizable by any 2-wfa. The incomparability of W2 and families of languages recognized by pushdown automata, n-head pushdown automata, and one-way stack automata is thereby established."
"The value of depth-first search or \"backtracking\" as a technique for solving graph problems is illustrated by two examples. An algorithm for finding the biconnected components of an undirected graph and an improved version of an algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph are presented. The space and time requirements of both algorithms are bounded by k1V + k2E + k3 for some constants k1, k2, and k3, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges of the graph being examined."
"The present paper shows how to construct a maximum matching in a bipartite graph with n vertices and m edges in a number of computation steps proportional to (m+n) n."
"In this paper it is shown that by suitably modifying Garner's algorithm for applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem to optimally employ the fast multiplication techniques of Schönhage and Strassen, one can often decrease the computing time of algebraic algorithms employing modular (congruence, residue) arithmetic."
"Arithmetic operations on matrices are applied to the problem of finding the transitive closure of a Boolean matrix. The best transitive closure algorithm known, due to Munro, is based on the matrix multiplication method of Strassen. We show that his method requires at most O(nα · P(n)) bitwise operations, where α = log27 and P(n) bounds the number of bitwise operations needed for arithmetic modulo n+1. The problems of computing the transitive closure and of computing the \"and-or\" product of Boolean matrices are shown to be of the same order of difficulty. A transitive closure method based on matrix inverse is presented which can be used to derive Munro's method."
  "A formal study of pattern recognition capabilities of cellular automata is undertaken based on a class of recently introduced grammars for two dimensions, the array grammars, which can be thought of as the two-dimensional generalization of context-sensitive grammars. The class of languages (patterns) generated by array grammars is shown to be precisely the class of languages accepted by cellular automata forming rook-connected finite subsets of the plane. Thus the usual generalization to rectangular array-bounded cellular automata is a special case of this class of machines. The concept of perimeter time is introduced as a natural measure of computing speeds for two-dimensional cellular spaces, and connectedness and convexity are related to this measure. The class of patterns with positive Euler number is shown to be linear-time recognizable by rectangular array-bounded cellular automata, thus solving an open problem of Beyer."
"LR-regular grammars are defined similarly to Knuth's LR(k) grammars, with the following exception. Arbitrarily long look-ahead is allowed before making a parsing decision during the bottom-up syntactical analysis; however, this look-ahead is restricted in that the essential \"lookahead information\" can be represented by a finite number of regular sets, thus can be computed by a finite state machine. LR-regular grammars can be parsed deterministically in linear time by a rather simple two-scan algorithm. Efficient parsers are constructed for given LR-regular grammars. The family of LR-regular languages is studied; it properly includes the family of deterministic CF languages and has similar properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a grammar to be LR-regular are derived and then utilized for developing parser generation techniques for arbitrary grammars."
"Let Σ be a finite alphabet, Σ* the free monoid generated by Σ and |x| the length of x ε Σ*. For any integer k ≥ 0, fk(x)(tk (x)) is x if |x| ≪ k+1, and it is the prefix (suffix) of x of length k, otherwise. Also let mk+1 (x) = {v|x = uvw and |v| = k+1}. For x,y ε Σ* define x ∼k+1y iff fk(x) = fk(y), tk(x) = tk(y) and mk+1(x) = mk+1 (y). The relation ∼k+1 is a congruence of finite index over Σ*. An event E ⊆ Σ*. is (k+1)-testable iff it is a union of congruence classes of ∼k+1. E is locally testable (LT) if it is k+1-testable for some k. (This definition differs from that of [MP] but is equivalent.) We show that the family of LT events is a proper sub-family of star-free events of dot-depth 1. LT events and k-testable events are characterized in terms of (a) restricted star-free expressions based on finite and cofinite events, (b) finite automata accepting these events, (c) semigroups, and (d) structural decomposition of such automata. Algorithms are given for deciding whether a regular event is (a) LT and (b) k+1-testable. Generalized definite events are also characterized."
"Given a particular computer system the extension problem concerns the prediction of performance when the size of main memory is increased. In this paper a specific approach to this problem is formulated for demand paging systems. A necessary and sufficient condition on the nature of page replacement rules which leads to solutions of the extension problem is a major result of the paper. As the other principal result we show that the class of replacement rules so defined is precisely that class of rules having the wellknown inclusion property. The paper concludes with a general discussion of topics related to the extension problem."
"A physico-mathematical basis is used to establish bounds TD(n) on the time needed to compute n-argument functions by spatially distributed primitive devices or composite systems D. The axioms used concern the speed, packing density and noise threshold of the energy with which any computing device detects or alters the physical representation of information. The principal result is that TD(n) grows at least as n1/3. Composite systems consisting of spatially distributed identical components are examined in light of this bound. Inherent bounds on the computing time of n-argument functions are then combined with TD(n), resulting in a measure of computational efficiency which bounds computing time to processor size."
 "This paper presents a self-contained and more elementary treatment of our mathematical theory of the syntax and semantics of language developed in [W-1] and [ W-2]. It applies this theory to the definition of subsets, and operators on subsets of the carrier of algebras. We show how regular and context-free sets of strings, recognizable sets of trees, and recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets of natural numbers or strings can be defined in a \"natural\" algebraic manner which defines \"similar\" types of sets for arbitrary algebras. We employ our mathematical framework to develop semantic and syntactic normal form theorems which explicate the relationship between different languages which define the same classes of sets and operators. We also investigate the relationship between our languages and the earlier work of Mezei, Eilenberg and Wright [M-W], [E-W] and the work of Eilenberg and Elgot [E-E]."
  "This note is concerned with the number of binary comparisons required to compute the maximum or the median of sets of numbers. The new results are: (a) the maximum of a set of n integers cannot be computed in fewer than n-1 comparisons if comparisons of only linear functions of the integers are permitted, but the maximum can be computed in log2 n comparisons if comparisons can be made between exponential functions of the integers and (b) the median of a set of n integers can be computed using only 2n comparisons if comparisons between polynomial functions of the integers are permitted."

  "It has been the intent of this paper to define a Database Management System as a network of logical subsystems, to include a specification of the gross function of each subsystem. Figures 1 and 2 describe the network and illustrate the relationships between the subsystems. An attempt has been made to define a hierarchy of solutions to the problem of file sharing - a problem which must be solved if performance is to be maintained in the face of a movement toward multi-access systems operating on large integrated databases. These solutions are developed in sufficient detail so as to make them clearly distinguishable. The ingredients of a ``secure'' Database Management System were discussed. The security problem, like the sharing problem, becomes critical as databases are made available to more and more users."

     "A new mathematical technique has been developed in the description of approaches for maintainability applications to system effectiveness quantification. It promises to have high utility because the method itself is completely independent of the probability density function for downtime. This is particularly important where combinations of more than one malfunction are sufficiently important to warrant inclusion in the system effectiveness equation. The potential sensitivity of each term can be quickly estimated by referring to a table for the individual terms of the Poisson formula [7]. This method's mathematical simplicity lends itself to hand computational techniques for small quantities of equipment. It is also easily computerized for more complicated systems."
"An algorithm is presented for designing minimum-expected-cost test trees for detecting and isolating single faults in a system. A test is specified by the subset of components that must be good for the test to pass, and with each test is associated a fixed cost. Each component is assumed to have an a priori probability of failure. The test tree specifies an adaptive testing procedure that detects a failure and isolates the faulty component while minimizing the expected cost of testing."
"The reliability of a 2-out-of-3 parallel redundant system having a limited number of standby spare units is derived when the exchange of the failed unit for a spare unit is not instantaneous. The reliability can be represented in the form of a failure state diagram. When the number of standby spares and the repair rate are both small, the influence of the exchange rate is small. When the number of standby spares and the repair rate are both large, the influence of the exchange rate is large. The number of standby spares and the repair rate influence the probability that system failure occurs after all spare units have failed. The exchange rate strongly influences the probability of system failure during the exchange time."

"The problem treated here is the theoretical one of deriving exact Bayesian confidence intervals for the reliability of a system consisting of some independent cascade subsystems with exponential failure probability density functions (pdf) mixed with other independent cascade subsystems whose failure pdf's are unknown. The Mellin integral transform is used to derive the posterior pdf of the system reliability. The posterior cumulative distribution function (cdf) is then obtained in the usual manner by integrating the pdf, which serves the dual purpose of yielding system reliability confidence limits while at the same time providing a check on the derived pdf. A computer program written in Fortran IV is operational. It utilizes multiprecision to obtain the posterior pdf to any desired degree of accuracy in both functional and tabular form. The posterior cdf is tabulated at any desired increments to any required degree of accuracy."
"The model finds the optimal time-independent component replacement policy for a system composed of components subject to probabilistic deterioration. According to this policy the system is reviewed periodically and components are replaced such that the system will operate at minimum expected cost. The final policy is easy to implement since decisions depend only upon the observed state of the system; hence, no component monitoring is required. Both the cost of operating the system in a degraded state and component replacement costs are considered. The model assumes that all past decisions affect the current system state as well as the system improvement cost. All time-independent policies are simulated and the one yielding the lowest expected cost is chosen. This paper presents the general mathematical development of the model with a description of the simulation procedure and a simple example of a six-component system."

"A probabilistic switching circuit is a switching circuit where each input, each component, and each output are all probabilistic. It is shown that each component of such a circuit can be treated as a random variable with value set {0, 1} so that probabilities of the output of the component can be represented by a Boolean function and the calculation of the probabilities of the outputs of the whole circuit can be performed with Boolean algebra techniques. Therefore, the estimation of the reliability of a probabilistic switching circuit can be done more simply and in a way familiar to the circuit designer."

   "Discrete renewal processes until recently have not been applied to the mathematical modeling of physical processes. Analyses of such renewal processes have proceeded on the basis of generating functions but the results are often too complicated to be of use. This paper presents an alternative approach to discrete renewal theory and calculates many of the more complex statistics of such processes."
"The probabilistic behavior of repairable two-state systems is studied. It is assumed that the reliability of the system can be measured by the amount of time the system has been operative. The operating and repair states are a pair of renewal processes, a particular mixture of which describes the statistical behavior of the system. The object of this contribution is to extend the results of Muth who has earlier obtained the average value of the downtime and its variance, when one of the constituent renewal processes has its interval lengths distributed exponentially. This paper, by the repeated use of the method of regeneration points, obtains the mean and mean-square values of the uptime distribution. In addition the correlation of the uptime for different times has been derived and a proof of Takacs' theorem is provided. Since the criteria for the reliability of the system include the associated cost, it is worthwhile investigating the operating cost over any period of time for arbitrary distribution of the two states. In particular a demonstration of the calculation of the first two moments of the total cost is given."
"A complex system consisting of N modules that are logically interconnected for mission success is to be placed in the field for a fixed period of time. For some modules, standby units can be provided, for others this option is not available, but we must select from among several design alternatives differing in cost, weight, and reliability. The problem is to determine simultaneously the module designs and the numbers of standby units to maximize the system reliability, subject to cost and/or weight constraints. Other authors have considered a similar problem for a pure series inter-connection of modules, but we permit the system to be any configuration of modules in series and/or parallel. A dynamic programming model is presented for this problem. The notion of the generalized decomposition operator is used to develop a set of recursive relations. An example is included."
"A priority standby system consisting of two repairable units is considered. One unit, the priority unit, is always in service except when it is failed. The standby unit is in service only for the duration of repair of the priority unit. Expressions are derived for the availability of such a system for both preemptive and nonpreemptive repair. The results assume reasonably general failure-time and repair-time distributions of the priority and standby units. The preemptive priority results are relatively insensitive to the form of the distributions."
"Traditional approaches to memory reliability have been limited to complete redundancy or coding techniques. Redundancy frequently proves too expensive (introducing additional systems faults) and the traditional memory coding techniques have been limited to those areas of memory where a single fault results in a single failure (e.g., a broken core in a magnetic memory) as distinguished from an address decoder fault. To take an integrated approach to this problem, using a variety of coding and modularization techniques on each of the memory subsystems, it is necessary to determine the types of faults and failures caused by these faults that could occur in the system. This paper presents the results of a failure analysis study of typical 2D, 2½D, and 3D memory organizations. Two-way memories are also considered. This study demonstrates that a 2D memory, utilizing a switching array for memory access, is less susceptible to eatastrophic failures than other organizations considered. A memory organization capable of distributing the failures, in a manner permitting correction by linear codes, was adopted. Other techniques for automatic replacement of fault units are also considered."

"Best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) based on a few order statistics are found for the location and scale parameters of the extreme-value distribution (Type-I asymptotic distribution of smallest values), when one or both parameters are unknown, such that the estimates have maximum efficiencies among the BLUEs based on the same number of order statistics. These estimates are then compared with the BLUEs and asymptotically best linear estimates (ABLEs) based on a few order statistics whose ranks were determined from the spacings that maximize the asymptotic efficiencies of the ABLEs. An application to the Weibull distribution is given."
"The replacement problem is considered in the light of stochastic point processes. The cost of replacements over a given period of time and the moments of the number of replacements therein are obtained."
"Requirements for unusual operating environments and high reliability necessitate qualification and life tests of new or changed components. Considering these requirements, test planners determine test environments, instrumentation, and the number of parts and elapsed hours for the life test. A technique is presented to deal with one specific aspect of test planning-the selection of that number of test units that will result in the lowest total cost of the life test."
"In this note we consider a special system that always requires more than one elementary path between its input and output terminals to perform its job. Since the special system may consist of components that are not series-parallel connected, the generalized reliability function for systems of parallel components introduced by Chan is insufficient for studying the reliability of this class of systems. However, an even more generalized reliability function for the special system can be obtained by generalizing the path enumeration approach (path-tracing method). The conventional reliability function and the generalized reliability function of Chan are special cases of the one derived in this note."
"Further to the recent discussion regarding the concepts of hazard rate and conditional failure density, it is shown that the latter may be expressed in terms of the former. Moreover, six functions, namely, failure time distribution function, failure time density, reliability function, hazard rate, conditional failure distribution, and conditional failure density, are shown to be equivalent to the extent that if one of them is known, the other five are completely determined. The results are summarized in a table."

      "Computer-aided statistical analysis of electronic circuits, designed to predict the effects of component-part variability on circuit performance, provides extremely useful assistance in performing a circuit design. The correlation method, a new computer-oriented technique of statistical analysis, provides precise estimates of performance variability, high speed of computation, and the computation of the distribution laws of circuit performance characteristics at a generic time instant. Thus, the quantitative characteristics of reliability can be predicted as functions of time."
"A conversational time-sharing computer program called Relcomp can be used for rapid and economical calculation of the reliability and mean time between failures (MTBF) of systems consisting of serial and redundant units. Relcomp is simple to use and does not require any special knowledge of programming. A copy of the complete Relcomp program listing is provided in Tymshare Super Basic language. Use of the program to calculate the reliability and MTBF of a system, its subsystems, and blocks is illustrated by examples."
"This paper briefly describes the Bias program1 and its application in reliability analysis. Except in the simplest of networks, the calculation of parameters for reliability analyses is not easily achieved. Because of the easy temperature variation and other features of the network analysis program Bias, it is extremely well suited to at least three commonly used reliability analysis procedures: failure mode and criticality, drift failure, reliability prediction (catastrophic failures)."
"The short electronic system development time, the acute competitiveness, the emphasis on lower costs, and the insistence upon high reliability has fostered practical computerization of the manager's and designer's reliability function. This computerization attempts to achieve feasible system optimization. The Computerized Reliability Optimization System (CROS) was developed by Hoffman Electronics Corporation's Computer-Aided-Design, Analysis, and Reliability Group to provide an optimum solution to the present system reliability methods. CROS is a comprehensive set of computer programs and a complementary design and management method for handling the total reliability function from proposal effort through the production and field-data analysis. The organization, application, feasibility, and results of CROS are discussed."
"The redundancy optimization problem is formulated as an integer programming problem of zero-one type variables. The solution is obtained making use of an algorithm due to Lawler and Bell. Objective function and constraints can be any arbitrary functions. Three different variations of the optimization problem are considered. The formulation is easy and the solution is convenient on a digital computer. The size of the problem that can be solved is not restricted by the number of constraints."
"A procedure is given for generating the reliability function directly from the Boolean algebra transmission function. This method is easily programmed on the computer so that it can be utilized both in the derivation of the reliability function and in the evaluation of the reliability. The easily obtained transmission function completely defines the relationship between elements in a configuration. Thus, by utilizing this technique, a large variety of complicated configurations can be easily evaluated and compared."
"A computer controlled data acquisition and processing system is described which acquires multiple-channel analog data at high sampling rates and stores the information on a digital magnetic tape. The system then processes the tape by deleting redundant data, making an arbitrary number of predetermined potentially complicated determinations about the data, and printing output results in full English statements. The system has been successfully interfaced with a number of one-shot test systems and centrifuges. It has resulted in considerably more accurate, prompt, and consistent data than previous methods employing galvanometric oscillographs."
"Mathematical modeling is a technique that engineers use to solve any practical problem. Its severe limitations and pitfalls are illustrated."
"This paper discusses the use of computers in calculating the unserviceable probability of a class of telecommunication networks. The unserviceable probability for a pair of terminals in the network is derived and is so complicated that it is not feasible to calculate without the use of a computer. Under the condition that every junctor in the network has a small ratio of mean service time to mean time between failures, it is shown that the computer-aided methods available for calculating network unreliability and network blocking probability are also applicable to network unserviceable probability. For the general expression of the network unserviceable probability, no simple computer-aided method is yet known. However, no urgent need for a computer-aided method for the general expression of the network unserviceable probability is envisaged since practical networks usually have small ratios of mean service time to mean time between failures for each of its junctors."
"By using data on the failure rates of electronic components collected by a European Bank, we try to form an idea on the validity of the various models (Bazovsky model, MIL HDBK-217A standard model, exponential model, RADC TR-67 models) that represent the variations of the failure rate with respect to the thermal and electrical stresses. Two different approaches have been programmed on a computer: 1) conventional, using the linear regression analysis 2) more modern using the Fletcher-Powell method or methods derived from it (Fletcher-Reeves or Davidon). The results are given for four types of components. The models studied reflect, more or less accurately, what happens in real life. We define and give a value to a criterion, allowing the model to be chosen closest to reality. This paper, apart from its practical interest on the validity of currently accepted models and its theoretical interest on the use of methods for seeking extremes, shows how the computer can assist the reliability engineer with the filing of data, the statistical processing of these data, etc., right up to the automatic tracing of networks of curves."
"A methodology for establishing a generalized Monte Carlo model for system availability and service simulation is useful to perform on-line tradeoff analyses. An example of an on-line time-shared computer program for a model of an infrequently operating system covering a large number of operational applications is described in detail. Examples of implementing the model for a variety of situations are also included. Advantages of this program are the ready accessibility to the engineer of a variety of field support operation simulations and their resultant availabilities and logistics requirements. Through tradeoff of system design parameters and operational variables, the simulation provides the capability for rapid system optimization at low computer cost."
"The error analysis problem is the resolving of a limited set of measurements in terms of a large set of possible but improbable physical errors. The relation between the measurements and the errors is modeled in part as a set of linear undetermined equations δv = Aδr, where δv is a vector of the measurements and δr is a vector of error parameters, and in part by specification of the relations between the parameters δrI and the physical errors. An approximate solution to the model equations is deemed physically reasonable if it reflects one or only a few of the physical errors. To evaluate a candidate solution consisting of δr and its interpretation as physical errors, we introduce a criterion function γ = γ0 + γ1; γ0 is a measure of ||δv - Aδr|| and 㬱 is a measure of the likelihood of the composite physical error associated with δr. With this criterion, the common least-squares (pseudoinverse) solution of the model equations is shown to be inadequate (it minimizes γ0 but not γ). A pattern recognition technique is presented and shown to yield solutions that are both numerically and physically reasonable, i.e., both γ0 and γ1 are small. The technique is illustrated by application to miscalibration analysis using an inertial guidance system model."
"This paper describes the results of predicting the reliability of a circuit at different radiation levels. The conditional mean and variance of circuit output and the conditional reliability are predicted using Sceptre and test data on components exposed to different levels of radiation. These predictions are compared with the results of tests of the circuit. The difference between predictions and tests are examined and explained. The conclusions suggest a minor modification of the proposed method. We also suggest that this method of computer-aided reliability prediction can be a valuable design aid. This is especially true when there is a significant effect due to environmental variation, such as the effect of radiation on semiconductors."
"In order to achieve a high probability of mission success (reliability), prolonged manned space missions require low failure rates for critical subsystems or components whose failure can be corrected before a mission abort or mission degradation, i.e., in-flight maintenance is one method of increasing mission success probability. In-flight repair or replacement of subsystems, subject to random times to failure, must be made before the maximum subsystem downtime is exceeded. Also, in-flight maintenance must take into account such factors as crew availability, time to repair, redundancy, failure rates, maximum allowable downtimes, and distributions of the preceding factors. The deterministic approach to obtain mission success probability is often too difficult to be applied within budget constraints. Therefore, a computer program was developed to estimate the reliability through simulation. Failures and repairs within a space vehicle were simulated, assuming a specific number of crewmen initially available for repair, constant failure rate, and lognormal repair times. Various parametric and sensitivity analyses of the important parameters were performed to determine their effects on mission success. For example, the effect of a subsystem's mean time between failures on mission success for selected crew sizes (keeping other variables constant) can be shown. An important realistic feature of the program is the associating of a repair priority with each subsystem. A higher priority subsystem can displace a lower priority subsystem already under repair and can be placed ahead of a lower priority subsystem in a waiting queue."
"This paper provides the results of a computer simulation performed to test compliance with a system maintenance requirement. Special attention is given to the selection of the simulation run time (sample size) and fitting a curve to the output data. The actual simulation program was written in the RCA Flow Simulation language which is similar to the IBM GPSS (General-Purpose Simualtion System) language. More specifically, the system requirement was as follows. The probability that the system maintenance-man loading exceeds 4-h repair time in a day (24 h) shall be less than 0.0025. Equipment failures and repairs were simulated via a computer. Equipment failure and repair probability distributions were used as input data. A year's operation was simulated in less than 2-min computer time. A simulation sample size of 360 days was selected on the basis of a statistical analysis using a nonparametric 0.60 confidence level. The results showed a maximum repair time in a day of 130 min, which indicates the system repair time distribution is considerably better than required. The output data were analyzed and the observed repair times were fit with an empirical distribution function."
"Specification of the rationale for developing a system quality measure entails considerable analysis and a careful evaluation of certain fundamental and often cherished reliability measures, e.g., mean time between failures or mean uptime. From such an analysis has come the following conclusions. In order to adequately assess the effects upon system performance of differing kinds and amounts of redundancy and to predict more accurately system availability, any nonclassical measure should quantify both length and quality of performance. A measure has been developed that meets such requirements, is distribution free, and can be evaluated in terms of system history. Two evaluational models with their peculiar difficulties are discussed."
"This paper develops a cost-based procedure for allocating the availability parameters (repair times and failure rates) to the various components that make up a system. The allocation is handled as a cost minimization problem, subject to the constraint of meeting a system availability requirement. The problem is solved using Lagrange multipliers and an example is stated and solved. This technique is applicable in the early stages of system design to determine the detailed component availability specifications (repair times and failure rates) that will allow a system requirement to be met. Furthermore, the technique is useful in the latter stages of system design when initial specifications have fallen short of the required goal, and modifications and improvements are required. The technique points out the problem components and defines the amount of improvement necessary."
"This investigation presents a method for determining the optimum mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and the number of redundant units to use in a multistage system to achieve a given availability at minimum cost. The method (basically a dynamic programming algorithm) is illustrated by a three-stage example."
"This paper attempts to bring together some of the well known and some of the lesser known probability distributions that are candidates for failure models in reliability studies. Each probability distribution is discussed in the light of a physical process that gives rise to it and as such provides a better insight to its potential user. Alternately, a user faced with the task of choosing a failure distribution can direct his choice by determining which of the physical causes discussed here best fits into his situation. The results presented in this paper, some of them very recent, have appeared in the literature, but in a scattered form. To the knowledge of this author, there is no single source of literature that presents all the failure distributions in a comprehensive form. This presentation will enable the reliability analyst to view failure distributions in a more complete context."
"We consider the problems raised by the requirement of N components, some or all of which are subjected to a burn-in program lasting a time T. A model is first analyzed in which N components are initially subjected to burn-in and failures are replaced at the end of the program by components that have not been burnt in. Then generalizations of this model are analyzed. These include one in which M > N components are subjected to bum-in initially and one in which intermediate replacements can be made at times before T."

   "A sequential method is given for obtaining confidence limits for system reliability when ``pass-fail'' test data have been obtained on components. Costs of testing are examined and a rule is derived for determining the order in which to test the components so that the average cost of testing is minimized. The method is presented first for series systems, but in Section IV the extension to parallel systems is considered and in Section V the procedure is applied to a series-parallel configuration. Comparisons are given with fixed sample-size testing and it is shown that the sequential method is statistically efficient and that many of the difficulties encountered when using fixed sample sizes are eliminated by testing sequentially."
"In this paper a general theory for constructing probability limits for life test data is briefly discussed. It is then applied to a set of life test data to determine which of three specified Weibull distributions give the best fit."
"This work demonstrates the feasibility of reliability modeling of systems with repair capability using a semi-Markov process. A two-unit system with exponential failure times but general repair times is studied. Formulas for state-transition probabilities, waiting-time distribution functions, and mean time in each state are developed. These quantities are expressed in terms of the Laplace transform of repair time distribution functions. Once these quantities are known, mean time to system failure and system availability, as well as other system parameters, can be found using matrix manipulations. In addition, time-dependent results may be obtained. A numerical example varying the parameter in a repair-time law is presented. The formulas developed can be extended to larger systems with repair capability for only one unit at a time and exponential failure times."
"In this paper, the theory of discrete Markov processes is used to develop methods for predicting the reliability and moments of the first time to failure of complex systems having many failed states. It is assumed that these complex systems operate in a repair environment and are composed of subsystems that have known constant failure and repair rates. Specifically, complex systems composed of any finite number of subsystems are considered. The complex system at any time is in an acceptable state or in a failed state. The methods presented for the reliability modeling of such complex systems assume a state behavior that is characterizable by a stationary Markov process (also called Markov chain) with finite-dimensional state space and a discrete time set. It is shown that once the matrix of the constant failure and repair rates of the subsystems is known, and the state assignment is made, then it is a straightforward matter to obtain the probabilistic description of the complex system."
"The reliability of a system is evaluated from information about the minimal states, using Poincare's method (inclusion-exclusion). An equation is derived using the minimal paths, which gives the reliability (the probability of system success) as a function of the reliabilities of the components; the unreliability or probability of system failure is obtained by subtracting this from one. Dually, with the minimal cuts, an equation is derived which gives the system unreliability as a function of the unreliabilities of the components; the reliability is obtained by subtracting from one. If some of the minimal states are missing, unknown, or unused, an error is made in the calculation. The probability which is calculated from the minimal states is underestimated and its complement overestimated. In this paper a method is described for determining the maximum error, both absolute and relative, when: 1) the minimal states are all statistically independent (e.g., they have no states in common); and 2) every minimal state has the same probability p, where p is selected so as to maximize the error. It is shown that the error and its associated system probability depend only upon the ratio of the number of minimal states used to the total number of minimal states. A table of errors, system probabilities, and relative errors is given for values of this ratio 0.01 (0.01) 0.99."
"A t test, proposed by Ogawa and based on the use of a few sample quantiles selected from large samples, is considered for testing the hypothesis H0: μ1 = μ2 against the hypothesis H1: μ1 ≠ μ2 concerning the location parameters μ1 and μ2 of two extreme-value distributions with common unknown scale parameter σ. Tables that simplify the calculation of the test statistic and an example illustrating their use are provided."
"The fatigue life of a mechanical component in a conventional ional test situation depends upon the stress amplitude. A change in the stress amplitude during a laboratory test-program involves a consideration of the damage produced by each stress cycle imposed upon the test specimen. A direct extension of this elementary concept to irregular stress waveforms provides a logical basis for a statistical analysis of product reliability due to random fatigue. The statistical behavior of the fatigue life is related to the probability distribution of the maxima and minima in a random stress waveform. The fundamental relation between the probability of survival and the maxima-minima is derived in this presentation, which contains a theoretical application to a simple random stress oscillation. The same expression may be used in the development of a computer program to evaluate product reliability from a numerical analysis of experimental data."
"The following paper presents the results of a comparative reliability study conducted on three tpes of high density circular connectors, conforming to NAS 1599, MIL. C. 38 999, and MIL. C. 81 511. After runing numerous relability tests, Souriau has been able to develop a highly successful high density connector."
"This paper discusses a mathematical model of a redundant device consisting of an active item, a standby item, and a failure-sensing switch. It is assumed that the failure rate of the standby item is less than that of the active item and that there is no repair. The results obtained for the reliability of the device represent several improvements over known results."
"A simple computational procedure has been developed for allocating redundancy among subsystems so as to achieve maximum reliability of a multistage system subject to multiple constraints which need not be linear. The computational time is quite short. Two examples are shown."

 "There is currently an acute awareness of the serious nature and spread of air pollution over many parts of the United States and other industrialized countries. Not only is air pollution costly, it is a hazard to health and life. The most recent federal estimate1 set the direct annual cost of air-pollution damage (in 1968) to materials, homes, vegetation, and health in the U.S. at $16.1 billion-and this is not the full accounting. Far more costly in human terms have been the episodes of intense air pollution that have taken a tragic toll of lives several times during this century: more than 1000 deaths in 1909 at Glasgow, Scotland; a large toll during 1936 in the Meuse Valley, northern Europe; 20 deaths and an estimated 6000 ill in 1948 at Donora, Pa.; and the infamous London ``episode'' of 1952 in which 4000 persons died within a few days. It may be conjectured that mere happenstance alone has preserved cities such as New York or Los Angeles from disasters of this magnitude. In view of the seriousness of the present pollution problem, IEEE Spectrum is presenting a three-part article-of which this is the first part-intended to explore a systems approach to large-scale air pollution. Part I covers the overall concept of a nationwide system, Part II will explore the necessary technical requirements, and Part III will outline mathematical models and describe control techniques."
"This article presents data concerning the often ``unmentioned'' influences of semiconductors upon power sources, other equipment, and the user. The influence of methods of power control and the resulting harmonics is considered in detail, including some new data on the effect of unbalanced firing angles. Also presented is information relative to metering accuracy, radio, telephone, and control-circuit interference, lamp flicker, and semiconductor influence, including the characteristics of a new RFI-free switching device. In addition, aspects of regulatory agencies are considered, and detailed references for further in-depth study are given."
"The trend toward centralization of population has created new problems in health care both in the sparsely settled hinterlands and within the resultant crowded urban areas. Communication links, including closed-circuit television, are already providing new means for consultation and for rendering psychiatric assistance. Wireless cardiac monitoring is helping to prevent relapse in coronary patients and transmission of electrocardiograms from moving vehicles is a dramatic step in delivering the patient alive to the emergency room. This report summarizes the conclusions of an Engineering Foundation Conference on ``Engineering in Medicine-Biotelemetry'' held at New England College, Henniker, N.H., August 2-4, 1971."

"The rapid growth of federally supported research and development during and following World War II, and particularly between 1950 and 1960, appears to have had several major effects on the technological activity of the United States and its industry. However, the most important effect of this growth was the rise in the cost of research and development, including the cost of the technical personnel involved in it. In an assessment of the U.S. investment in R&D for space and defense versus civilian-oriented research and development, it is seen that the United States lags behind the eight European nations studied, and trails Japan even further. With this in mind, it is clear that if both the social and material needs of the people are to be met, new policies and new directions are required of governmental, industrial, and academic institutions."
"This article discusses the design and installation of a 300-MVA, 19-km, 138-kV, high-pressure, oil-filled submarine cable for spanning the Long Island Sound between Norwalk, Conn., and Northport, N.Y. The use of self-contained, oil-filled cable for this crossing represents a major contribution in the field of cable technology. This long-desired intertie became a reality with the development of new low-viscosity impregnants-capable of coping with severe hydraulic transients-and with improved design, manufacturing, and installation techniques. The associated terminal facilities and system considerations are also described."

 "One of the outstanding reasons for the active development of controlled fusion nuclear reactors as a source of electric power, aside from economic advantages, is that they are extremely attractive from an environmental standpoint. The basic principles and some of the most pressing problems are presented in this article. Among the problems considered are plasma confinement, heating, fuel injection, and exhaust collection."
"A benchmark survey of engineering employment shows the picture to be brighter than supposed-but still sobering. Results confirm many past conclusions concerning the geographic nature of the problem and highlight the degree of severity existing in mid-1971. Overall unemployment for U.S. engineering professionals who are members of engineering societies is 3.0 percent. One significant fact to emerge is that electronics engineers have an unemployment rate equivalent to that of engineers in the aerospace field; both are the highest among all engineering disciplines -more than 5 percent."
"Two-way communications on a cable television system can be achieved in many different ways. This special report surveys the various approaches that have been proposed and are being tried experimentally in the field. The emphasis is on the basic engineering configurations rather than on the uses to which the systems can be put. For almost all of the systems, the possible two-way uses are limited only by one's imagination. The capability for any communications task exists if one is willing to pay the price."

"Atmospheric carbon dioxide, which amounts to 320 parts per million (ppm) by volume, rather than being a pollutant, is essentially a thread of life woven through the globe on which we live. In the past century alone, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 40 ppm, with levels increasing at a current rate of about 0.75 × 1010 tonnes per year. Fortunately, man can tolerate CO2 levels many times present concentrations, and plant life actually grows better at increased CO2 levels. What does cause concern is the effect that atmospheric CO2 has on the earth's climate. It appears that the 40-ppm increase over the last century may have contributed to a global temperature increase of the order of 0.2 K. Since 1940, however, the global atmospheric temperature has been decreasing-an indication that other factors (such as atmospheric dust) are of much greater importance in determining the overall heat balance of the world."
"The general configuration for air-pollution control systems that was outlined in Part I will impose certain requirements upon system components-including hardware (sensors, data processors, communications), software (air quality laws, emission regulations, data processing, simulation programs), and of course the organization and the people who staff it. Most important of all, and surely the most costly, will be the gas-cleaning equipment, process controls, and operating changes that are required of industry, institutions, and private individuals. The means of implementing the systems functions described in Part I (Oct. IEEE Spectrum) will be considered here."

Applications to artificial intelligence and other fields are suggested."
"IC testing has evolved from the patterns established some years ago in the production of semiconductors. Since manual testing cannot meet the complex needs indigenous to IC manufacture, highly sophisticated instruments and test systems have developed that are automatically programmed by computer, tape, or printed-circuit card.

"Amid the tumultuous confusion and complexity of modern events, it is difficult to acquire the general historical perspective so important to the scientist and the engineer of pioneering nature. Yet a broad vision of the past is a most valuable asset to the workers and inventors of today. It forms a foundation for further progress and suggests roads to even higher goals than we have thus far reached. It is truly said that we of today stand on the shoulders of giants. To help us use the past to inspire us to future achievement, the authors of this article give us a thrilling trip in what might be termed a ``technological time machine.'' Hopefully we shall all benefit from the lessons set forth, from the examples of Galvani and Volta, of Nobili and Matteucci. We of the space age, with all the array of modern techniques at our command, clearly still can gain much by noting and emulating the ingenuity, inspirational qualities, and tenacity of purpose of these great pioneers. Present-day investigators may also marvel at the insight of their predecessors who derived so much fundamental knowledge with the primitive and even erratic equipment at their disposal. It is truly remarkable that they wrested such great wisdom from such limited resources. If the story of their ability can continue to guide and encourage the scientist and the engineer, then the future promises ever-greater accomplishments for the service of mankind."
"The future air-pollution control system that is described in Parts I and II of this article will be equipped with sensors to monitor the current status of local air pollution and meteorological factors such as wind, stability, or mixing depth. The system will be furnished not only with data on the location and strength of pollution sources and synoptic weather conditions, but with any other information needed to forecast air quality for a period of 24 hours or more. Once these statistics have been compiled, however, it is the job of the mathematical model to convert the data into pragmatic decisions for controlling the air resource."

"Derived from a report of the Ad Hoc Committee To Assess U.S. Economic Conditions in the Electrical, Electronics, and Related Industries, this article reports on the group's principal findings for the 1970s. Their study sees a slowing of the demand for engineers with the rate increasing at about 2 percent a year, with supply and demand for electrical engineers reasonably in balance Government spending in domestic areas will probably not offset military and space decreases until at least 1980. The electrical/ electronics industry will show an average annual growth of about 7.5 to 8 percent per year. Government action to provide a better data base on manpower and industrial output, reduce trade barriers, stabilize the economy, and foster research and development through tax incentives is urged."

  "When ``digital computer'' was an institutional rather than a household word, the machine required some very special personnel to cajole anything from its limited facilities. The operators came to the computer and spoon-fed it. And the computer's limited ``brainpower'' permitted only one operator at a time to tinker. Today, computers can be programmed so that almost anyone can be trained to access them-at least, in a limited way. Moreover, these electronic machines now have such massive central and peripheral memories that many people can use them simultaneously. Since it is impractical to have all of the computer users make a pilgrimage to the computer, the computer is made to come to the people that it serves. This is done via communication channels-predominantly in the telephone network. The various factors involved provide the substance for this primer article."

"The engineering profession must go beyond the purely technical realm if it is to assume a leadership role in the issues of our time. For the National Society of Professional Engineers, the challenges posed by the problems of social change, the economy, and the environment have provided the impetus for developing programs for the engineer who seeks ``involvement.''"
"The history of linear induction motors extends as far back as the 19th century. Although these machines have been practically forgotten for the last 30 or 40 years, there appears to be a genuine revival of interest in them. The fascinating history of these ``unrolled'' motors and their theory of operation is the subject of Part I of this article. Part II will deal with the unique advantages that such high-performance systems have for modern-day applications."
"The Labrador Plateau of northeastern Canada, which is more than 460 meters above sea level, forms a shallow ``saucer''-with a few chips missing in the rim. Thus some water escapes through these low points to other streams; but most of the drainage is through the Churchill River, whose most dramatic feature is the 75-meter-high Churchill Falls. Long reaches of rapids precede and follow the falls so that the river drops more than 300 meters over a course of 30 km through a deep cut in the edge of the plateau. By means of man-made diversions, the water that would normally cascade over the rapids and falls will be retained on the plateau and directed into a new channel leading to the forebay intake of the power plant. The dents in the saucer will be ``plugged'' by 64 km of low dikes. The impounded water will back up to fill a reservoir area that will be about 40 percent of the area of Lake Ontario. At a newly constructed outlet, the water will funnel down 11 penstocks to a huge underground powerhouse, through 11 turbines, each driving a generator; thence it will flow into a surge chamber, follow two tailrace tunnels, and emerge finally into the Lower Churchill River. An unusual feature of the huge powerhouse complex will be a central computer capable of monitoring hundreds of plant functions. Under normal circumstances, two operators in the central control room will be sufficient for station operation."
"Each academic year more than 100 engineers from the Phoenix metropolitan area participate in the freshman engineering program at Arizona State University either as technical consultants or as jury members for the semester design competition. Although this program requires the use of consultants and judges, the benefits of the joint effort extend far beyond these important functions. The freshman engineers are provided an opportunity to talk to practicing engineers on a personal and informal basis and at a time when their own ideas about engineers and engineering are still very hazy. The combination of faculty and experienced engineers working together with students on a common project, with each of the participants contributing in his area of interest and specialization, has established a spirit of mutual understanding and respect."

   "The basic tem, known since the early used in a variety of applications in instrumentation and space telemetry. However, because of its cost and complexity in discrete (nonintegrated) system design, its application has been limited to precision measurements requiring a high degree of noise immunity and very narrow bandwidths. With the recent developments in integrated circuit design and processing technology, this situation is rapidly changing. The monolithic PLL is now emerging as a new and versatile building block, similar to the monolithic operational amplifier in the diversity of its applications. The availability of a lowcost PLL system in a monolithic circuit package opens up many new applications that cost and complexity previously precluded. The purpose of this article is to acquaint the reader with the basic principles and design parameters of an integrated PLL, as well as with the wide range of applications it offers in both analog and digital signal processing."
"Noise in laser recording is treated from the viewpoint of measurement techniques, equipment design, film choice, and laser power. Signal-to-noise criterions that have been found useful in specifying wide-band magnetic recorders are presented to aid in establishing noise performance parameters for laser recorders. It is shown that such equipment can be built so that it will have an insignificant effect on total noise performance and that, although film granularity is the ultimate limit on noise, improvements in SNR are a function of increased laser power. The design of a 100-MHz analog laser signal recorder is used as the basis for discussion; however, the theory and techniques apply to all forms of laser recording."
"The tion can compromise the accuracy of such equipment as tracking radars, photogrammetric cameras, and laser range finders. The refraction is caused by a lowering of the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves; this change in velocity has a direct effect on the measurement of distances using propagation time, whereas the deviation of the vertical angle is proportional to the rate of change of velocity with altitude. The errors can be reduced if the pertinent atmospheric parameters (such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and water-vapor pressure) are known, or can be approximated, for the propagation path. This article derives straightforward techniques for the calculation of these errors and illustrates the procedures by exploring some typical optical refraction problems."

 "Electronic music synthesis is a process whereby several parts or elements of a musical composition that are performed or produced as separate entities are combined to form the entire or rendered composition. Since the entire process can seldom be carried out in real time, the synthesis of music has not been a performing-type rendition; therefore, the final product takes the form of a record that can be reproduced at any given time. Electronic music synthesis includes the modification and combination of conventional and original sound sources, manual and programmed electronic music synthesizers, and digital computers."

 "A threshold gate has binary inputs and outputs just like any other logic gate. The difference, however, is that in the threshold gate the inputs may be weighted and, eventually, a binary decision made as to whether the total weight is more or less than some reference. This principle of weighting and summing the inputs rather than simply noting the presence of all inputs as high (as in an AND gate) or one input high (as in an OR gate) is the reason that a threshold gate can tell more about the state of the inputs, thus providing greater ``logic power.'' This article gives some examples of the applicability of threshold logic, as well as an integrated-circuit approach for building arrays of versatile threshold gates. In addition, some logic designs are described and compared with conventional ECL implementations."
"In the last few years, semiconductor random-access memory (RAM) components have been introduced into high-speed scratchpad applications and small buffer memory systems, where the performance or cost advantage of semiconductor components is greatest. More recently, developments in the technology of large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits have resulted in cost-performance characteristics of semiconductor RAMs that are competitive in computer main-frame memories as well. This article reviews the basic circuit concepts used in these components, representative products that are presently available, and some systems considerations involved in their use."
"The electric power industry faces a dilemmaߞthe need to supply ever-increasing quantities of electric energy and power vital to mankind and, at the same time, to control pollution of the environment to viable limits. This subjectߞthe great environmental debate and the power industryߞwas discussed at a special session during the 1970 IEEE Summer Power Meeting and EHV Conference by a panel of experts from the electric power industry, state and federal regulatory bodies, and the nuclear community. The program centered around the following lecture by Philip Sporn, reprinted here in full, in which he takes as his theme sentence Loren Eiseley's statement, \"Increasingly there is but one way into the future: the technological way.\""

"This survey reviews the current state of automation in the testing of electronic components, networks, and circuits. Elements and characteristics of typical test sytems, both hardware-controlled and computer-controlled, are described. Paths to be followed and pitfalls to be avoided in achieving automation are discussed in an effort to help the reader toward a better understanding of the subject and its broad applications. ``How to automate successfully,'' a major theme in the report, places emphasis on economic justification."
"This two-part article discusses the use of operational amplifiers in applications involving both digital and analog signals. In some cases the digital signals are used to control the acquisition of samples of analog signals. In other applications the digital signal is being converted into an analog voltage or, conversely, an analog is converted to a series of digital words. This first installment is concerned with multiplexer, D/A converter, and A/D converter circuits. Part II, scheduled to appear in the June issue, will be devoted to sample/hold modules, peak detectors, and comparators."

 "Ecap II, a nonlinear dc and transient circuit analysis program, uses a free-format, problem-oriented language for describing circuit parameters and topology. Its computation speed is high enough to make the transient analysis of kilobranch nonlinear circuits feasible. The program includes a nested model feature that permits the user to store circuit descriptions of devices and subcircuits for subsequent recall and insertion into larger circuits. Nonlinearities can be specified by means of tables, built-in functions such as the diode equation, and Fortran subroutines. A diagnostic feature pinpoints errors in the input format or inconsistencies in the circuit description."
"The growing use of vacuum interruption devices by the power and control industries in the past decade has introduced these mechanisms to many people to whom the area of vacuum switching is somewhat new. It is felt that a review of vacuum switching from a historical and technological standpoint will facilitate a more general understanding of this important subject."
"There are two basic types of sample/hold circuits- inverting and noninverting-and two important parameters for these circuits-aperture time and acquisition time. Peak detectors are special forms of sample/hold modules in which the peak value of an input signal, once reached, is automatically held. The last networks discussed in this article are comparators, in which one or more summing resistors are connected to the inverting output of the operational amplifier."

"Most electrical engineers and electricians are aware that the principal danger from electricity is that of electrocution, but few really understand just how minute a quantity of electric energy is required for electrocution. Actually, the current drawn by a 7½-watt 120-volt lamp, passed from hand to hand or foot, is enough to cause fatal electrocution. Just as it is curent. and not voltage, that heats a wire, it is current that causes physiological damage. This article gives some indication of what this damage consists of, with specific application to the problems of industrial plants."

 "Recent advances in materials and processing have resulted in a new class of information-handling structure-the charge-coupled device. This three-layer structure creates and stores minority carriers, or their absence, in potential wells near the surface of the semiconductor. The minority carriers move from under one electrode to a closely adjacent electrode on the same substrate when a more negative voltage is applied to the adjacent electrode. Because of their high transfer efficiency, these devices have already found application as image sensors. In addition, there is every expectation that memories made by use of the stored-charge concept will be less expensive and faster, and will require less power than a magnetic counterpart now in use."
"This article summarizes the ideas that are being actively discussed for use in mobile radio and, in particular, how they apply to the new 900-MHz region assigned to the Land Mobile Radio Services category. Over the next decade some of these methods will prove out and others will probably fall by the wayside. It is clear, however, that some new techniques will be necessary if mobile radio is to continue its growth."
"An electric utility system is predicated to be in one of four possible states: normal, alert, emergency, or restorative. Examination of these states and the structure of the system's operating problems has led to a multilevel, multicomputer approach involving computers at various action centers interconnected by data links. Within the hierarchical computer arrangement, a four-step approach of monitor and display, contingency evaluation, corrective strategy, and automatic control is suggested. Major attention is directed toward minimizing the probability of leaving the normal state as well as the time required to return to this state. The computer functions to be undertaken at each level are described."
"Historically the national goals of the United States have depended to a large extent on its science and technology. Now the character of this dependence is changing in light of the increasing emphasis on societal problems. The nature of these problems is discussed and needed actions delineated. It is concluded that the most critical areas in which progress is necessary are in the formulation of objectives and translation of these objectives into implementable action items, in the orchestration of resources, and in institutional reforms. It is pointed out that the engineer has the choice of playing a critical leadership role in the decade ahead or of being left to perform routine technical tasks set for him by others."

"Experiments with both long, continuous tones and short, transient tones have shown that the human ear is insensitive to relative phase differences between fundamentals and overtones. Short notes from a piano and from a drum are studied here to show that the phase requirement for music reproduction is that the group velocity of the system be constant in the relatively narrow regions surrounding the fundamentals and overtones. The phase velocity across the audio spectrum does not have to be constant, thus easing the requirements on loudspeakers, crossover networks, and tape recorders. Pulse-testing schemes require minimum-phase behavior of a system for simple interpretation and therefore tend to overtest a music reproduction system. Random noise can be used as a test signal if elaborate processing equipment is available. However, the sinusoid is still the best test signal for determining distortion and relating device performance to theory."
"According to the ECPD definition, engineering involves the use of the forces and materials of nature for the benefit of mankind. Unfortunately, in the course of their daily work engineers may forget to question whether their technological developments really will be a boon to society, and experience has shown that too often quite the reverse proves to be true. If the engineer of the future is to be more than a technical specialist and is to assume an effective and active role in dealing with the environment, then it would seem that electrical engineering curriculums should be adapted to familiarize the student with environmental problems and their relationship to his chosen profession. This article discusses the beginning that has been made at one university with the introduction of an experimental course on environmental electromagnetics."

 "The Rayleigh surface-wave mode propagates on the surface of suitable elastic solids with velocity independent of frequency at about 10-5 times the speed of light and an attenuation of about 1.5 dB for 104 wavelengths. Thus as a delay line it is far more compact, has much less attenuation, and can be much cheaper than electromagnetic delay lines. Piezoelectric elastic solids permit the launching and detection of the waves by electrodes on the surface. Fabrication technology is similar to that used for monolithic semiconductors and amplification is possible by interaction with carriers in a semiconductor surface layer. Parametric interactions can be used to perform convolution of two signals. The feasibility of deflecting and modulating light beams also has been demonstrated. This rapidly developing art can today produce delay lines, filters, pulse compressors and expanders, and pulse-sequence generators and decoders, and in the future may perform convolution, correlation, and light-beam manipulation in small, economical, low-power structures."
 "Hundreds of atomic frequency standards and precision crystal oscillators exist in remote locations throughout the continental U.S. that are synchronized through fairly complex and costly means. Today, however, an inexpensive synchronization system is available in the form of live television broadcasts by commercial networks. In precision and accuracy, the television method is comparable to the portable atomic clock and/or Loran-C, with average day-to-day differential delays less than 1½s. Based on the results of the tests presented here, the use of nearly any solid-state television receiver and a low-cost horizontal sync pulse generator can provide 10-μs synchronizations at all times. The operation of a TV line-10 timing system, including the circuitry of auxiliary equipment, is also included. This article gives about 1½ years of substantiating data for the three major commercial networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC). There is also provision for synchronization with the NBS and/or USNO Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) scales through regularly published reports."

"Separately spoken individual words can be automatically recognized using a two-dimensional pattern of spectral density versus a nonlinear time base. The pattern for a given word differs from person to person and must be adaptively learned by the machine for each speaker. Simple circuitry is described that learns a word with a single utterance and recognizes it thereafter. The scheme is potentially economical for the spoken equivalent of key entry of data and data inquiry, and a limited vocabulary of commands to the equipment."
"Some writers have accused engineers of lacking proper concern for the effects of their developments on society and the environment. There are indications that many students hold this same point of view. However, the author of this article contends that such criticisms are unwarranted and offers evidence that, with the exception of the academician, engineers have shown foresight and concern for the public by developing a large number of standards to ensure product quality and safety."

  "Without question, the citizen of today's technologically oriented nation is much better off materially than his nonindustrialized neighbor, who in turn is struggling to become a part of that ``better world.'' However, as an increasing number of our critics remind us, our productive society has its problems, many of which are by-products of the very system that has provided us our wealth and strength. By eliminating time and space, electronics has given modern man the capability to recognize these defects in his way of life. It is equally important that he recognize how truly far he has come-and, given the wisdom to do so, how much further he can go."
"The danger of patients being electrocuted in hospitals, particularly those who are ``wired'' to cardiac catheters, electronic pacemakers, and defibrillators- or connected to these and other devices simultaneously-has been the subject of numerous articles in leading newspapers, and in technical and professional publications. Physicians, engineers, and consumer-interest activists have offered statistics and opinions on the extent of these hazards. The range of concern involved among those either directly or peripherally involved with medical-electric equipments seems to run from consternation to minimal perturbation. Thus it is a controversial subject. Suggestions have been made that hospitals and medical-engineering staffs should adopt purchase-selection programs to evaluate the competing claims that equipment salesmen make for their products. Such programs might also include the testing and rating of medical devices and electronic apparatus. Proper maintenance of equipment and adequately trained operators of such devices in hospitals are equally important aspects of a comprehensive safety program."

"A popular limerick of a few years ago told of a designer who dreamed ''he was going mad, designing circuits pad by pad. He screamed, and woke, then thanked the dad, whose fertile mind had fathered CAD.'' This special report surveys the current revolution in computer-aided design systems and services for semiconductor design, layout, and fabrication. Recent breakthroughs in turnkey products-especially in low-cost terminal design-have permitted semiconductor houses that heretofore could not afford CAD to achieve error-free designs and eliminate much of the layout drudgery. Greater efficiency in design and better yields in production are just two of the benefits of these design aids."
"When funds are tight, design and development are curtailed first; however, marketing is one of the last areas to go. That's the view of two recent electrical engineering graduates who spent last summer in a ten-week pilot program for junior marketing engineers. The marketing assistantship program described here was developed by the Hewlett-Packard Co. to acquaint engineering undergraduates with the job opportunities available in marketing. The authors soon realized that their initial impressions of this field were somewhat misleading."

"Our general experience so far has shown the display of a virtual memory use pattern to be a good diagnostic tool. The automatic sector reordering technique brings noticeable improvements in paging performance where there is room for improvement, reducing the necessary working space (for a given number of exceptions) by as much as one-third to one-half. We have worked entirely in the environment of a simple hierarchy of main memory and a uniform speed replacement memory, with all replacement blocks having the same size. We have found that the reordering process, assuming a page size of 4K bytes, also produces improvements on pages of 8K and 2K bytes with the improvements favoring the doubled page size over the halved. This is consistent with a tendency we have noticed in the programs we have examined for better packed memory to favor larger page sizes. But the page size for clustering bears a direct relationship to the program sectors themselves. It has not proved effective to cluster at the physical page size when the average sector size is half as large or more. The optimal page size for a program depends on (besides physical I/O timings) complicated patterns in the use of virtual memory, about which very little is known."
"We conclude from the discussions in this paper that measurements taken over a sufficiently long period on a system in full operation can lead to a meaningful assessment of system performance under various configurations. For instance, we have shown that addition of a core box has increased average through-put and that reduction in overhead by recoding some CP modules has resulted in increased peak-load capacity."
"This experiment was a rather unique and pioneering example of the management of a traffic facility to maintain close to optimal traffic conditions. In that sense, it may be viewed as a precursor of traffic systems of the future. Such systems are likely to involve a fair amount of intervention in the allocation of traffic facilities to traffic demands, a feature virtually absent from traffic systems today. Our traffic-control experiment demonstrated the following four distinctive features: • Accurate, continuous traffic density determination in sections of a traffic link by an ad hoc pattern recognition technique • Development of density-oriented controll algorithms for continuously optimizing traffic flow • Remote location of the computer • Sharing of a computer between batch scientific computations and real-time process control"
"The model of this paper results in a near-optimal solution to a production, inventory, and work-force planning problem where the number of items is large compared to the number of facilities and time periods in the planning horizon. It extends the work of Dzielinski and Gomory3 to assembly production. Based on the product structures, constraints are generated to maintain the precedence relations among items and solution methods are discussed. Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is applied to the program and it is noted that generalized upper bounding may also be used. A suboptimal procedure that does a level-by-level óptimization is presented, and it may be satisfactory in many applications. The optimal procedure involves a consideration of all levels simultaneously."
"In this paper, we restrict the word sorting to mean the ordering of data by a digital computer. Given a collection of data entries and an ordering key, various processes can be invoked to arrange the entries into a desired order. The order is commonly an ascending or descending numerical or alphabetic sequence, but other orders are possible. At one time, the meaning of the word sorting was limited to the process of pigeon-hole classification, whereas the words “re-arranging” or “ordering” carried the broader meaning. More recently, however, sorting has come to include all techniques for the ordered arrangement of data."
  "In the advances administrative system, we drew on the following earlier technologies that were innovative at the time we began planning the system: • On-line data base management of airline reservation systems • Interactive teleprocessing terminal environment of airline reservation systems • Computer assisted instruction • Operating system with multiprocessing capability"
"Central to successful operation of a computer system based heavily on reentrant (or pure) procedures is reliable and efficient dynamic management of free storage. Such systems must allocate, use, and release one or more blocks of free storage for each task or system operation, e.g., each I/O task or each request for supervisor services. For any list-processing system, such as AED or LISP, efficient management of free storage is a fundamental problem. The consequence of errors in allocation and release is usually total collapse of the system; that of mismanagement is usually processor inefficiency or under-utilization of the free-storage pool. The processor inefficiency resulting from a poor or ill-chosen management algorithm is usually tolerated, even though it is high relative to that of other system functions; under-utilization of free storage is less tolerable, as “lock-up” can be encountered. This circumstance must be averted by task deferral or “garbage collection” procedures, both of which are costly to system performance."
"Existing empirically founded techniques for timing individual jobs are not suitable for long-range planning. The main reasons are they are tied to an existing system structure; necessary detail on individual jobs is not available on a long-range basis; and the types of jobs are subject to considerable uncertainty. To improve this situation, we suggest a planning technique for many system alternatives. In addition, this technique should require only relatively general information about the work load at the planning horizon. The basis for the model is a probability-based macromodel of multiprogramming by Gaver."
     "The techniques required and results obtainable when applying logic to programs are well illustrated by Example 4. Firstly, it demonstrates the possibility of treating program segments in isolation, and using the results obtained directly in their condensed forms in a treatment of the containing program. With this technique, the amount of formalism involved at any one stage in the proof can be kept within reasonable bounds. It also shows that any program computing the dot product under the appropriate conditions may be substituted for the inner loop."
"Each subroutine in the FORTRAN extended-precision library has been subjected to a set of rigorous performance tests involving thousands of random sample arguments. Master reference programs that compute these functions in 38 hexadecimal digits of precision were used to measure the accuracy of the tested programs. Despite the elaborate care exercised in preparation of the programs in this library, these programs cannot create accuracy where there is none. The accuracy of the computed function value depends on the quality of the input argument as well as the quality of the algorithm used. Seemingly minor contamination of the input value can cause substantial relative errors. The most one can expect and all we have attempted is to minimize any error due to computational method by careful coding, which includes occasional use of guard digits. The average cost of this use of extra precision arithmetic is estimated to be about 10 percent in execution time and somewhat more in storage requirements. We believe this to be a reasonable price to pay for the extra precision of the results."
"The Computer Assisted Network Scheduling System (CANS) performs the major functions of producing conflict-free schedules, and maintaining files of Manned Space Flight Network resources, schedules, and requested actions. The system also performs the functions of simulating requested actions and displaying their effects. All CANS functions may be performed interactively or in the batch mode of computing system operation. Although CANS was originally designed and used on System/360 Model 95 with OS/360 in the MVT environment, it can be used with the System/360 Model 40 (or larger) with the storage specified in the paper and can be modified to operate in the DOS, MFT, or other configurations. The system described is presently in operation at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Although it is highly oriented toward scheduling the Manned Space Flight Network, the CANS design concepts are potentially transferable to many complex scheduling problems. Most scheduling applications have in common with CANS such capabilities as schedule preparation, file maintenance, and conflict analysis. Although CANS is optimized around the concepts of mission safety, priorities, and user specification of the time of action, the system could be optimized for a different set of constraints just as well. Under the constraints given in this paper, the lowest cost or most efficient schedules cannot be produced; under other conditions, these factors could be improved. Since CANS performs the functions of planning and simulation, it can be adapted to model, simulate, modify, and determine system loading for an unknown or hypothetical system."
  "The formal description methods introduced in this paper were related to our simple language SPL for explanation purposes. Actually, the methods (i.e., abstract trees, predicates, state components, control trees, etc.) apply to all programming languages. However, some programming languages contain facilities that cannot be expressed using the methods described in this paper alone. For example, additional definitions are required to represent the multitasking facilities of PL/1. To solve this particular problem, an extension to the execution control of the abstract interpreter was used in the formal description of PL/1."
"This paper compares three simulation methods with straightforward sampling to study the efficiency of these methods in estimating the performance of a demand-paging system model. Measures of system overhead, queuing delays, and transient response of the modeled system are related to parameters describing the processing demands of the programs load. Our results for this specific system model suggest that variance reduction from straightforward sampling techniques is obtainable by the method of antithetic variables. However, one should not necessarily expect a similar gain for all response variables in a model. With regard to variance reduction, additional gains may be obtainable by a combination of stratification and antithetics."
"The asymptotic properties of the machine interference model were described in this paper. When the properties of the system were appropriately normalized and represented in terms of the variable w (=nu/v), the size dependencies of these properties were of order 1/n in regions of the most interest, that is, w < 1. Furthermore, the model displayed a functionally different behavior in the region w ≥ 1. The region around w = 1 was described as an unstable region in which an equivalent simulation model could be expected to stabilize slowly and probably give results different from the mathematical model. The asymptotic formulas are simple in form and quite accurate, and they allow the performance of queuing analysis with very little effort. In the last section of the paper, the solution and the properties of the generalized machine interference model were given."
"This paper has described the design of an experimental system intended for solving complex problems. Facilities are provided for stating a problem as a labeled block diagram of arbitrary complexity. A block diagram can be drawn on a representative sheet that is many times larger than the screen of the cathode-ray tube. The block diagram may be structured into a hierarchy of sheets allowing blocks to be designed and specified by the user. The modeling subsystem provides a number of viewports so that more than one sheet can be displayed. To make entering of block diagrams easier, a drawing package that does not require commands for creating the diagram but uses only the operands to determine the command is a part of the system. Finally, a data structure in the host computer is provided to allow for easy access to data by any application program."
  "A self-isolation scheme is proposed for fabricating transistors in semiconductor integrated circuits. Such integrated circuits with double-diffused transistors require three diffusions and one epitaxial layer in the proposed process. Since no isolation or reach-through diffusions are involved, this technique could reduce the area of a memory or logic cell by 50% or more."
"High-performance transistors with small geometries require a highly doped collector region to produce a large impurity gradient at the collector-base junction. This allows the structure to sustain high current densities and to attain low collector series resistance. However, the resulting increase in collector transition capacitance degrades the ac characteristics of the transistors. A structure is proposed and experimental results are presented in this paper to demonstrate that the conflicting requirements above, which limit the high-performance characteristics of transistors, can be resolved by the planar IC process."
"Planar silicon technology has been used to fabricate mesa Schottky barrier diodes with high breakdown voltages. This method proves to be superior to alternate methods used to increase the breakdown voltage of Schottky diodes. The processing techniques and characteristics of mesa Schottky diodes are described in this paper."
"For high-speed performance as well as high packing density, it is desirable to make the components in integrated circuits as small as possible. One of the fundamental problems in making smaller components is that of limitations in the optical technology. This paper describes an experimental process and the results obtained by using an electron-optical system to fabricate small transistors. Planar bipolar transistors with emitter and base contact windows one micron wide have been fabricated, with the electron beam exposure system used to open all the diffusion windows as well as to expose the metallization patterns. Conventional etching techniques are unable to provide 1-µm wide metal paths in half-to one-micron thick metal layers; therefore the lift-off process is used. The dc and ac characteristics presented compare favorably, for the first time using this fabrication process, with the best bipolar transistors produced by optical masking processes. These characteristics provide a guide for refinement in future micron transistor design."
"The use of ion accelerators to implant impurities in crystals has become the subject of widespread research. Such studies have been limited mainly to low energies with acceleration voltages of 50 to 500 kilovolts. In this energy range, impurities are implanted into the upper micron or less of the surface."
"Arsenic-doped emitters have been shown to produce high performance in bipolar silicon transistors. In comparison with phosphorus, the emitter dopant commonly used in the industry, the use of arsenic results in a steeper gradient (1024/cm4), less compensation of the base region, no “emitter dip” effect, and a flatter profile with higher sheet conductivity. Since arsenic atoms are a better match to Si than are phosphorus atoms and the arsenic process requires lower surface concentration for a particular diffusion depth and sheet conductivity, fewer crystal defects are generated. As a result the arsenic emitter process results in a higher device yield and is much more reproducible, even for shallow diffusion depths. Arsenic-emitter transistors, both with and without gold doping, are found to be superior in performance, with 1.6 to 2 times higher gain bandwidth, ƒT and current gain, β, than those with phosphorus emitters with similar geometry. Also the ability of the arsenic emitter to sustain large current densities, exceeding 30,000 A-cm−2, makes it extremely desirable for high density, small geometry, and high-performance silicon devices."
"After diffusion temperature and time, the most important parameters in capsule diffusion source behavior are the dopant vapor pressure characteristics in the capsule. The vapor pressure behavior is a function of the degree of homogenization of the Si-dopant system and hence of the source preparation technology. Various methods of preparing Si-As source material are discussed. Homogenized-source preparation is described as it relates to reproducibility and controlled capsule diffusion behavior. The measurement of the kinetics of arsenic vapor pressure development in a typical capsule system and the role of vapor pressure in determining capsule diffusion behavior are described. Finally, the dependence of arsenic vapor pressure characteristics, and hence of the diffusion, on source weight-to-capsule volume ratio is described."
"It is proposed that double acceptor-level vacancies are responsible for arsenic diffusion into silicon. A computer program, which combines this diffusion mechanism with the formation of arsenic clusters and an internal electric field induced by the impurity gradient, is used to calculate arsenic diffusion profiles in wide ranges of diffusion temperatures and surface impurity concentrations. The calculated diffusion profiles are in good agreement with the measured profiles."
"Since the energy band structure of heavily doped silicon is not well understood, neither the Fermi level nor mobility can be calculated accurately. Thus, the electrically active impurity profile is very difficult to obtain either from measurements or calculations. However, for As-doped n-type silicon, the total As concentration profile (the total concentration of both electrically active and inactive As) can be measured by neutron activation analysis. The sheet resistivity, an important parameter in controlling diffusion, can then be calculated from the total As concentration profile by means of the equation where ρ(x) is the resistivity (ohm-cm), xj is the junction depth, and x = 0 is the location of the silicon surface, if an accurate curve forr esistivity vs total As concentration is available."
"Static magnetic fields, resulting from an applied field, are calculated in the vicinity of a magnetic body. Specifically, numerical results are given for a rectangular body of constant permeability. The reduction or shielding of the magnetic fields is calculated in the neighborhood of the body. Integral equations are developed which can be solved numerically on a computer. Typical fields are described for rectangles of different thicknesses, and comparisons with known solutions are shown."

     "Arrays of GaAs injection lasers have been fabricated for use in an experimental EuO film memory system. Planar-type array structures are formed by diffusing zinc through parallel slots in a diffusion mask on a GaAs wafer. Details of fabrication are given and some initial test results on operating characteristics and life performance are reported."
"Monolithic arrays of planar diffused GaAs injection lasers have been fabricated using diffusion masking and photolithography to delineate the junction area. After contact metallization, the arrays are soldered to a sapphire wafer which serves as a heat sink and carries the contacts for each junction. The diodes operate cw at 78 K and the threshold current density. Jth = 700 to 1100 A cm−2. The dc power output is linear at least to 5 × Jth and the power efficiency, ηP is about 40%. Threshold and power output are quite uniform across the array but the beam polarization varies at random from one unit to the next."
"Four properties of GaAs laser arrays i.e., the efficiency, junction width, beam spread, and polarization, are important in assessing the usefulness of such devices in beam addressable memory applications. Measurements made on a series of arrays are presented. It is shown that the first two parameters closely approach the characteristics of an idealized array, while the latter two reduce the energy density at the storage plane to 25 percent of that at the junction surface. With existing devices, information has been written and recovered at a bit rate of 10 MHz."
"In this paper a rate-equation model is developed for a single-wavelength dye laser. The model is unique in that it accounts for the fact that triplet-state lifetimes are not necessarily very long, as has been previously assumed. This modification makes it possible to analyze more accurately the behavior of dye lasers that are pumped with pulse energies above threshold. Computer solutions of the rate equations are obtained and an experimental technique is developed to measure amplifier gain, which is then used to estimate populations of molecules at various energy levels. An experimental study of triplet lifetimes in anthracene is included in an Appendix. These results support the experimental values obtained by Stockman for Rhodamine 6G, which are used in our calculations."
"A technique is described for accommodating rapid-transfer-rate experiments within an IBM 1800 Time Share Executive (TSX) laboratory automation monitor designed primarily for slow-scanning, low-drift apparatuses, each having the computer control its independent variable. The slow-scan experiments may be delayed for substantial periods to allow break-in by, and dedication of the computer to, those tasks requiring acquisition of short bursts of high-speed data. The system is structured so that each user can implicitly and dynamically specify the current maximum time interval for which his experiment may be interrupted. The break-in on a slow-scan experiment is done on a demand-response basis through the use of interrupt coreloads and masking of all other interrupts that are likely to interfere with a particular high-speed scan that has been initiated. When data acquisition is completed, control is returned to the time-sharing system by unmasking the interrupts and an appropriate data analysis task is queued for later execution."
"The application of a time-shared IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control Computer to data acquisition and reduction in transient photoconductive decay experiments is described. These experiments present an interesting problem in laboratory automation, since they involve high data rates (data periods frequently on the submillisecond scale), a free-running independent variable (time), and a mode of operation in which it is possible to amass large quantities of data in a relatively short time. Techniques are described wherein these transient data are collected in real time while the computer simultaneously monitors many timer-based, slower-scanning experiments. The computer is shown to facilitate a variety of otherwise formidable data manipulation and analysis tasks. In addition to improving the quality of the data obtained, automation of these measurements provides data analysis and display of physical results within minutes after each data logging run, permitting the experimenter to interact closely with the data in a fashion not possible under manual operation."
"The automation of a quadrupole mass spectrometer - residual gas analyzer (RGA) on a time-shared IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control Computer is described. The RGA, which is used to determine the partial pressures of various gases in a vacuum system, may be operated up to a maximum data rate of about 20,000 points/sec (pps) in an interleaved manner with multiple slow-scanning (≤20 pps) instruments. We review in detail the hardware and software considerations regarding the design and subsequent interfacing of the instrument to the computer. Methods for initiating data collection, entering experimental parameters, and analyzing the experimental data, such as spectrum plotting, smoothing, peak location, mass identification, and calculation of the partial pressures by using a least-squares approximation to fit mass peaks, are discussed with examples."
"It is shown that a reasonable fit of experimental to calculated data can be obtained with a simple model of the PdO/Ag-Pd glaze resistor. An equivalent circuit describing the temperature characteristics of the glaze resistor is proposed. The experimental measurements can be reproduced quite adequately over a considerable temperature range, using an equivalent circuit consisting of a semiconductor contact resistance in parallel with a metal. A quadratic term in (1/T2) in addition to the usual linear term with (1/T) for ln σ is used to obtain a good fit at low temperatures. (T = absolute temperature; σ = conductivity.) This parabolic curve approaches the experimentally observed values for palladium oxide."
"In linear dynamical systems with white Gaussian plant and observation noise and quadratic cost criteria the well-known separation theorem of stochastic control holds. The result is that the determination of the system matrix for the compensator depends on the solution of two Riccati equations, one arising from a deterministic regulator problem and the other from a filtering problem. It is shown in this paper that if the given system is single-input, single-output and time-invariant, one can achieve substantial savings in computation time. Assuming controllability and observability and using the standard controllable representation of the system matrix, we show that at each iteration step of the solution of the algebraic matrix Riccati equation by Newton's method the number of variables to be solved for reduces from the customary n(n+1)/2 to n. Moreover, the number of operations to determine these n variables is on the order of n3/16 as opposed to n3/3 in ordinary matrix inversion. The observability matrix is used as a similarity transformation so that the Riccati equation for the filtering problem is placed in the same format and the above procedure may be used again. The results obtained are easily extended to the case in which the system is either single-input or single-output. The system matrix of a fifteenth-order compensator was determined using 0.92 seconds of computer time on the IBM System/360, Model 67."
"In this communication we apply certain continuous analog iterative methods to two sample boundary-value problems. We show that the Euler-Newton and the second-order continuation of the Newton method are both useful algorithms for obtaining solutions to classes of nonlinear boundary-value problems. For a convergence analysis we rely upon a number of convergence theorems presented in earlier work. We indicate, through the numerical results, that the relaxed Newton methods are particularly useful in the iterative solution of “strongly” nonlinear problems where little information is available concerning “good starting values.”"

  "The recently discovered boiling phenomenon called “multi-fluid subdued boiling” is discussed. It has been observed that when a beaker containing two immiscible liquids of dissimilar densities is heated at the bottom, the vapor bubbles rise in the lower liquid until they reach the liquid-liquid interface. There the bubbles are trapped, and after a short period of time they collapse. As the heat transfer is increased, however, the bubbles begin to coalesce to form a new set of “interface bubbles,” and the latter eventually become large enough to break away from the interface and rise into the upper liquid layer. Upon reaching the liquid-air interface most of the bubbles do not escape into the ambient but suddenly condense, contract and drop back toward the lower liquid level. “Boiling off,” or net vapor generation, is subdued. The prediction of the interface bubble sizes is also discussed. Analysis shows that the properties of the fluids used can be included mathematically in nondimensional parainetric forms, by means of which the shapes and sizes of the interface bubbles can be found."
"A technique has been developed that adapts the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm for implementation on computers having relatively long multiplication times. The technique is particularly well suited to real-time processing on a small data acquisition computer such as the IBM System/7."
"This paper shows the basic similarities among various data transmission techniques. It generalizes the concept of how the signal element serves as a unifying feature of various modulation schemes. The present approach permits an extension of the digital echo modulation technique, originally introduced by A. Croisier and J-M. Pierret, to cover most of the cases of digital data transmission. The practical application of digital echo modulation to the design of modems is discussed and examples of digitally implemented modem transmitters are given."
"The rate of electromigration in thin films of aluminum and aluminum alloyed with copper has been determined by measuring the changes in resistance of stripes subjected to a current density of 4×106 A/cm2. At temperatures in the range from 100 to 200°C the activation energy for electromigration has been found to have the same value for both the pure and the copper-alloyed samples, namely, 0.6 eV. However, the rate of migration is much smaller, by a factor as large as 100, in the copper-bearing samples. These results are discussed in terms of grain boundary diffusion and the effect of alloying additions on diffusion mechanisms."
"Monolithic System Technology (MST) is a microelectronic circuit family consisting of high-density monolithic circuit chips on ceramic substrates. Using current-switch emitter follower (CSEF) logic, the technology is designed to provide a balanced reflection of cost and performance requirements. One version, MST-2, has been developed for use primarily in the middle range of System/370—the Models 145 and 155. The typical package usually consists of a single multi-circuit chip on a 16-pin module substrate, and the design embodies a number of recent interconnection and packaging developments that make it well suited to large-scale automated production."
"The design innovations in the IBM 3803 Tape Control Unit and the IBM 3420 Magnetic Tape Unit are discussed. The new design concepts include a full readback parity check, a system of microprogram control that obtains high operating rates through overlap of channel control and motion control functions, a new phase-error detection system, a modified dual-density recording feature and a new interface between the control unit and tape drive. The combination of novel error detection methods, control features and programming support (including an expanded scheme of on-line diagnostics) contributes to greatly improved total system performance over previous models of tape subsystems."
"We describe the theoretical dependence of emitted light power on current in a continuously operating p-n junction laser, based on an injection laser model previously developed by the author. The analysis relates power output to threshold current, electrical resistance, thermal resistance, and external quantum efficiency of the laser, all quantities that can be independently measured or calculated for particular structures. The equations presented thus constitute a simple analytical model for both thermal design and diagnosis of operation of cw injection lasers."
"Switching times of large Josephson devices have been measured. We report gate switching times of 85 ps and array cycle times of an elementary memory cell of 550 ps. Although these times are expected to be smaller in more realistic miniaturized devices, they represent to our knowledge, the shortest times for such circuits ever reported in any technology."
"An optical synchronization technique is described for the demultiplexer of a wideband optical data transmission system. In this system, the closely spaced optical pulses of interleaved PCM channels are “space sorted” by a coincidence detection technique using an optical reference waveform generated in the receiver. For synchronization of the reference waveform with a spatial waveform produced by the received laser beam in the demultiplexer, a number of pulses on these two optical waveforms are coded with a pseudo-random sequence. Acquisition of the coded waveforms for synchronization is indicated in an optical matched filter. For automatic tracking, a synchronization error-control circuit is added."
"A method is shown that transforms the problem of inverting an ill-conditioned matrix to one of inverting a diagonally dominant matrix. An error analysis is outlined and the method is compared in theory and in result with the commonly used iterative methods. This direct method is demonstrated to be the limiting case of an nth-order iterative procedure as n approaches infinity. Examples are given that show the advantages of the direct method even under adverse conditions. The unreliability of the convergence of the iterative technique due to computational errors is also discussed."

  "The principal subject of this issue is an aspect of analytical design that we call “the mechanics of materials.” We define this term to mean “the study of the natural properties of engineering materials so as to control their behavior in use,” and have selected seven papers representing work to which it applies."
"The “IBM wear model,” which has previously been used to describe the wear of electrical contacts as a result of gross sliding motion, is used to describe contact wear in the case of small-amplitude sliding motion. This model was applied to a particular contact configuration on which a series of wear tests was performed. The empirical results of the tests are compared to the theoretical expressions and good agreement is found, thus indicating that the wear mechanism is essentially the same for both large- and small-amplitude sliding contact."
"An analysis of the impact process in a particular type of high-speed printer was undertaken to determine the effect of hammer length on the contact time. The hammer is modeled as a one dimensional wave propagation medium and the paper-ribbon combination as a dissipative, nonlinear medium with hysteresis. The integrated macroscopic viscoelastic parameters for a particular impact geometry and hammer momentum were determined from a combination of the analytical model and the experiments run on an instrumented printer robot. Permanent deformation of the paper-ribbon caused by character penetration was also determined in this manner. The simulated model was then used to predict the change in dynamic behavior of such a system due to variations of the hammer length. The hammer length is shown to have only a tertiary effect on contact time in such a dissipative deformable nonlinear system. This result demonstrates that the widely discussed use of hammer length as a design parameter to control contact time in impact printing is invalid for such a dissipative system."
"A simple mechanism is sought to account for the frictional energy losses encountered in the mutual contact surface of two bodies pressed normally against each other. The mathematical model of Coulomb friction is assumed valid, and it is shown that slip between the contacting surfaces develops in the outlying regions of contact. This model, used in conjunction with a numerical scheme, leads to a set of nonlinear simultaneous algebraic equations in the surface tractions. Two specific cases are computed: those of a rigid sphere and of a rigid roller each pressed against an elastic medium. The relative size of the slip region is shown to depend on the material properties. Energy dissipation during a half contact cycle is calculated, and the influence of the secondary adhesive tractions on the contact stresses is discussed."
"Reflection and transmission x-ray topography can be combined to isolate and identify dislocations that penetrate the active junctions of transistor structures in integrated circuit wafers. This is accomplished by reconstructing the defect distribution normal to the surface as viewed in transmission (volume-sensitive) and reflection (surface-sensitive) x-ray topography. The combination of surface and bulk observations is exploited to demonstrate the effect of dislocation density on pipes (low-resistance paths from emitter to collector). A method is also described for estimating the depth of defect visibility in reflection x-ray topography."
"In open-tube diffusion furnaces, nitrogen is often used as a carrier gas for impurities. Nitrogen flowing over silicon wafers at the diffusion temperature creates extremely thin surface films, which act as strong diffusion barriers. Similar barriers are formed on silicon wafers even in capsule-diffusion systems because of the residual atmosphere. Phosphorus-impurity profiles are found to be kinked due to these diffusion barriers. The position and dependence of the kinks on various diffusion parameters such as time, temperature and impurity concentration in the carrier gas are discussed. The kinks are eliminated if the formation of the thin-film barriers is avoided through use of argon or other noble gases. A mathematical model is presented to explain the kinked behavior of the profiles."
"A number of internally plasticized copolymers and terpolymers have been prepared which are shown to be suitable for thermoplastic recording. These materials were responsive to both in-air and in-vacuum recording techniques, where the electrostatic charge is applied by corona charging or electron beams, respectively. Several of these materials were tailored for Schlieren optical readout while others possessed properties suggesting their use in recording systems requiring electron beam readout."
"A method is described for measuring the size of the largest spike-shaped magnetic domains on surfaces of grain-oriented 3.25% Si-Fe. Values of coercive force, obtained by using measured spike-domain size in a previously derived empirical expression correlating spike size with the coercive force in silicon-iron, are in close agreement with coercive force values obtained from B-H loop measurements. This technique makes it possible to measure the coercive force on non-toroidal magnetic components used in data processing machines."
"This paper reports an investigation of some methods for isolating, or segmenting, characters during the reading of machine-printed text by optical character recognition systems. Two new segmentation algorithms using feature extraction techniques are presented; both are intended for use in the recognition of machine-printed lines of 10-, 11- and 12-pitch serif-type multifont characters. One of the methods, called quasi-topological segmentation, bases the decision to “section” a character on a combination of feature-extraction and character-width measurements. The other method, topological segmentation, involves feature extraction alone. The algorithms have been tested with an evaluation method that is independent of any particular recognition system. Test results are based on application of the algorithm to upper-case alphanumeric characters gathered from print sources that represent the existing world of machine printing. The topological approach demonstrated better performance on the test data than did the quasi-topological approach."
"The experimental three-level system modeling technique discussed in this paper can be used during the design stage of a system for identifying mismatches among the architectural, microprogramming, and hardware logic levels. Compatible switching between modeling levels is emphasized. Execution of an application program by the architectural and microprogramming level models with switching between levels is illustrated."

  "A method is described which solves the dynamic equations for air circulation at Grashof numbers that are in the range of environmental temperatures of rooms. Previous two-dimensional computation techniques were limited to G ≈ 105 but environmental conditions require G ≈ 1012. The higher Grashof numbers become calculable through the design of a mixed system of nonlinear difference equations which has purely leading-phase-error properties. In addition provision is made for nonlinear stability by explicitly programming cross derivative terms in lieu of employing “time splitting.” The isotropic behavior achieved through time splitting is retained by the system of difference equations. Details of the required algorithms are included."
"A random-walk, headward-growth model of stream network development in a region of uniform lithology and uniform slope is proposed. The principal difference from previous models is that the probability of growth is made dependent on the area contributing runoff to the stream tip. Two versions of the model have been studied in detail and shown to give satisfactory results. A major advantage is that all of the important network variables, including drainage density and outlet density, come naturally out of the simulation processes."
"The Computer Augmented Oscilloscope System (CAOS) is a special computer terminal facility intended for laboratory experiments involving waveforms and their interpretation. The system provides digital acquisition of waveform data, system control and calibration, data analysis, and graphic and alphanumeric display. Pulse parameter determination requires the use of all system capabilities since a) hardware and software options must be chosen or controlled, b) the pulse waveform must be digitized, c) the appropriate analytical algorithms must be applied to the data and d) the results of analysis must be displayed. Specific attention is given to the algorithms required for pulse parameter determination and a new procedure for determining base and top magnitude of a pulse waveform is presented."
"A description of the electrophotographic discharge process is presented for a homogeneous photoconductor characterized by constant free-carrier lifetimes and trapping times. The physical model is described by a set of one-dimensional nonlinear differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions. It is shown that a quasi-steady-state approximation can be derived which is valid for most of the decay process under typical electrophotographic conditions. In this quasi-steady state, the photoconductor layer can be described by an equivalent circuit which consists of a capacitance in parallel with a two-terminal element whose current-voltage characteristic is directly related to the field-dependent photoinjection efficiency. A numerical analysis using large-scale computation of the solutions to the differential equations has been done for a hypothetical but typical material. The results of this computation, which describe the initial transient behavior and the subsequent quasi-steady-state behavior of the photoconductor, are presented. The results of the quasi-steady-state analysis agree with the actual behavior of amorphous Se. It is suggested that measurement of the quasi-steady-state photodischarge process can be used as a convenient technique for obtaining the field-dependent characteristics of the photoinjection process."
"The interaction potential between Li+ and HD (with internuclear separation fixed at 1.4 a.u.) was determined by two different methods using the results of a recent self-consistent-field calculation of the potential energy surface for Li+-H2. In one method, Li+-HD interaction energies were obtained utilizing an analytical representation of the Li+-H2 surface. The second method used ab initio Li+-H2 interaction energies directly to yield the Li+-HD potential surface by means of interpolation procedures. The interaction potentials determined by the two methods are essentially identical and have been fit to an analytical form, V(r,θ) = ∑lvl(r)Pl(cos θ), to facilitate scattering studies. For large center of mass distances, perturbation theory is in good accord with the potentials constructed by the two procedures."
"The standing wave on ultrasonic bonding tips and the tendency of the lower end to fold back upon itself, termed “lug-down,” have been measured under actual bonding conditions. These phenomena have also been modeled on a computer. Lug-down can be a major contributor to bonding failures in designs having an overly slim tip. One definition of a “bonding failure” is the production of a bond between wire and monolithic circuit pad which lifts, when the wire is pulled at 90° to the pad, under a wire tensile force less than 25% of the ultimate tensile strength of the wire. Improper location of nodes can also contribute to bonding failures. A tapered tip has been shown by mathematical analysis to possess a higher resonant frequency and fewer nodes than a tip of uniform cross section. Using the newly developed taper tip, means were found for minimizing lug-down. With judicious trade-offs, it is now possible to optimize tip geometry for a particular bonding application."
"Frictional heat generation can develop localized high temperatures at the tape-head interface of a computer tape drive and can seriously affect the performance of the drive. Using standard heat transfer theory, we calculated the magnitude of this “hot spotting” to be of the order of 21°C for an IBM 2400 series tape drive. In general, it is almost impossible to accurately measure hot spotting on a tape drive. A series of calculations was performed to investigate why this is so."
"Though everyone is daily made aware of the existence of electromagnetic interference (as when one drives an automobile near a faulty neon sign and hears a loud “buzz” on the car radio, or when one uses a television receiver while an electric mixer is running nearby and the interference from that appliance obliterates the picture) it is not the most frequently cited form of pollution. However, radio communication services are expanding at a rapid rate, receivers are becoming more sensitive, and we are moving toward more complex types of communication. Because of these factors and the accelerated growth in the use of electrical appliances both at home and in industry, there is an ever-increasing effort to control electromagnetic interference caused by electrical equipment. Some nations, in fact, have promulgated laws to control electromagnetic interference. As industry responds to the need, undoubtedly more and more electrical equipment will have built-in powerline filters and other noise-suppression devices to prevent interference. The problem, however, is not merely one of the cost of adding a powerline filter, but that the addition of a filter may also affect the safety and performance of a machine."

  "In current computer technology, the most obvious role of chemistry is that involving the study of solid-state inorganics. Diode and transistor fabrication techniques involve silicon, germanium and III–V species like gallium arsenide. Selective and nonselective etching, passivation and doping are representative of the chemical processes involved."
"A numerical model of the general atmospheric circulation is used to simulate the global transport of carbon monoxide. The sources are estimated from gasoline consumption data. Since the strongest sources lie in the northern hemisphere belt of strong prevailing westerly winds, “chaining” effects are quite pronounced. Emissions generated in one populous area are soon superimposed upon those of the next area downwind. Subscale cumulus convection, which is parameterized in the model, accounts for a significant fraction of the vertical CO transport."
"A recently developed experimental method is described to populate by Hg photosensitization and observe by absorption spectroscopy the triplet states of polyatomic molecules in the gas phase; detailed discussion and analysis of the experiment are given. The technique can be used to investigate triplet states that cannot be populated efficiently by the intersystem crossing process and to detect triplet absorption bands located within the wavelength range of ground-state absorption of a molecule. A modulation scheme, based on a novel type of Hg resonance light source—an rf-driven toroid capable of modulation frequencies up to 250 kHz—is used for monitoring the optical absorption (by phase-sensitive detection) and measuring the lifetime of the transient species. Sensitivity is comparable with that of flash spectroscopy for transients that decay by a second-order process. Results obtained for several aromatic hydrocarbons are reviewed. New transitions were detected by this method for triplet-state naphthalene, and the absorption spectra and decay kinetics of triplet-state benzene and toluene were measured for the first time. Some applications of the technique to problems other than triplet-state spectroscopy are illustrated or outlined."
"Photoconduction has been observed in single crystals of benzene, naphthalene, biphenyl and pyrene using the pulse technique. Experimental procedures have been found for the purification and crystal growth of the materials that produce specimens whose charge carrier lifetimes are sufficiently long to allow the measurement of drift mobilities, and thus to determine the number of charge carriers produced per pulse. A single-photon generation mechanism was observed only in pyrene. The other materials exhibited a photogeneration mechanism that depended quadratically on light intensity and was determined to be exciton-exciton collision ionization."
"The major products of the photochemical addition at 253.7 nm of benzene to cyclobutene in solution were found to be tetracyclo[5.3.0.02,1003,6]-decene-8 and tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca-7,9-diene, which arise from 1,3- and 1,4-additions. The quantum yields for both reactions were independent of benzene concentration below 2M but decreased at higher concentrations. The maximum quantum yields that were obtained are 0.81 and 0.09 for the 1,3- and 1,4-reactions, respectively, indicating that the former reaction is a very efficient process. The 1,3-addition may occur from the singlet (1B2u) state of benzene, as has been suggested in the literature. The origin of the 1,4-addition is not clear, but it seems unlikely that it occurs from the triplet state of benzene."
"To investigate the mesomorphic behavior of aldonitrones, a series of 13 homologs of N-(p-alkoxyphenyl)-α-anisylnitrones was prepared and characterized. Although most of these substances exhibit normal nematic or smectic mesophases, the trend in nematic-isotropic transition temperatures to increase as a function of alkoxy chain length is an exceptional occurrence. Comparison of our data with that of analogous compounds previously reported indicates that thermal persistence of the nematic phase of these compounds increases in the following order: 4,4′-dialkoxybenzylideneaniline, 4,4′-dialkoxyazobenzene, N,α-di-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-nitrone, 4,4′-dialkoxyazoxybenzene. In addition, the phase transitions were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The entropies of the mesophase-isotropic transitions of the nitrones imply that the long alkoxy chains, in contrast to a widely held belief, are not restricted to a single conformation in the mesophase."
"The thermal transitions in cholesteryl palmitate, an ester having liquid-crystalline states, have been evaluated and compared to previously reported data. A sample synthesized from carefully purified cholesterol and palmitic acid using p-toluene sulfonic acid compared directly with previously reported data. A sample of recrystallized ester from a commercial source showed a slightly depressed solid-to-mesophase transition temperature. However, the mesophase proved to be smectic, commonly reported as monotropic with respect to the solid phase. Both smectic-to-cholesteric and cholesteric-to-isotropic-liquid transitions were sharp, indicating a pure material. It is postulated that a specific impurity, possibly an isomeric cholesterol ester, is responsible for this previously unreported effect. This effect of related compound interaction has been reported for nematic-mesophase-forming compounds. Thin layer chromatography, microscopy, depolarized light intensity analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy data are offered in support of this postulate."
"Up to the present time nuclear magnetic shielding anisotropies (Δσ) have been determined in nematic liquid crystal solutions by comparing the chemical shifts in the isotropic and nematic phases. Unknown changes in solvent-induced shifts arising from the isotropic → nematic phase transition constitute a serious problem in the interpretation of the results. To avoid the ambiguities inherent in these shifts, a method is described for measuring Δσ in the nematic phase alone. This technique has been used to determine Δσ in a variety of 1H- and 19F-containing molecules and the results are compared with those obtained by the two-phase method."
"A digital magnetic recording system is viewed in this paper as a linear system that inherently includes a correlative level encoder. This encoder can be regarded as a linear finite-state machine like a convolutional encoder. The maximum likelihood decoding method recently devised by Viterbi to decode convolutional codes is then applied to digital magnetic recording systems. The decoding algorithm and its implementation are discussed in detail. Expressions for the decoding error probability are obtained and confirmed by computer simulations. It is shown that a significant improvement in the performance with respect to other methods is achievable by the maximum likelihood decoding method. For example, under the Gaussian noise assumption the proposed technique can reduce raw error rates in the 10−3 to 10−4 range by a factor of 50 to 300. These results indicate that the maximum likelihood decoding method gains as much as 2.5 dB in signal-to-noise ratio over the conventional bit-by-bit detection method."
"A new organic photoconductor has been developed, consisting essentially of a 1:1 molar ratio of one molecule of 2, 4, 7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNF) to one monomer unit of poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVCz). This photoconductor (1:1 TPC) is nearly panchromatic in the visible range of the spectrum and has a white-light sensitivity approximately equal to that of amorphous selenium when used for electrostatic imaging. The photosensitivity, which is due mainly to the TNF-PVCz complex, is greater for negative corona charging than for positive charging. Charge acceptance of the 1:1 TPC is high, ≈1200 volts for a 13 µm film, indicating good dielectric strength. Dark decay of the charge is affected by substrate materials and substrate surface conditions. In general dark decay is slower for negative charging than for positive charging. Quantum efficiency (Q.E.) is nominally about 0.15 in the range of 400 to 500 nm but decreases somewhat for shorter and longer wavelengths. The Q.E. increases rather markedly with field strength, but decreases somewhat at high light intensities. Field-controlled photogeneration of carriers is indicated, and thermal measurements show a field-dependent activation energy in the range of 0.06 to 0.20 eV. The absence of residual potentials in light decay curves and the lack of a thickness effect in photodischarge currents indicate that no deep traps are present in the 1:1 TPC layers."

  "In tracking repetitive square waves, the latency of saccadic eye movement to a change in target position decreases as the tracking run progresses. The latency in the steady state takes its minimum value for frequencies between 0.5 and 1.0 Hz. A model is proposed to predict this behavior of the saccadic eye movement system. Forming an estimate of target motion and carrying out the optimal control based on the estimation are the main features of the model. The estimate, in particular that of the period of square waves, is assumed to be performed with some inevitable variance depending on the input frequency because of the sampled data nature of the system and the memory mechanism becoming more uncertain with increasing time. In relation to sinusoidal target motions, a similar model is suggested to explain the reduction of latency to the steady-state value soon after the onset of target motion. Further, the transfer characteristics in the steady state are obtained for both the open-loop and closed-loop systems. It turns out that in both cases the predictive controller can be approximated by a serial connection of a high-gain element and a predictive element."
"Techniques and concepts from cybernetics and engineering are used to combine partial models from economic literature into a more comprehensive macroeconomic model. The resulting linear model is capable of exhibiting short-period inventory cycles and long-period fixed capital investment cycles around a long-term constant growth rate trend. The rate of growth of total production is controlled by a monetary mechanism which links innovative investment to the level of unemployment."
 "It is shown that a certain weighted average of the prior distribution and the empirical distribution yields an estimate of the posterior distribution that is consistent with Bayes' theorem. A comparison of this approach and conventional parametric Bayesian estimation is made for some specific cases."
"One method of interpreting aerial photographs is to divide a frame of imagery into square cells, to extract recognition data from each cell, and to classify one cell at a time according to statistical decision theory. An algorithm for extracting contextual information from neighboring cells to improve cell recognition performance in such a system is presented. The algorithm was tested with a Monte Carlo technique which drew contextual information from real imagery but which simulated the as much as one half by the addition of context, and the amount of improvement was found to be largely independent of the parameters of the simulation."
"A multidisciplinary team is currently studying the applicability of computer simulation to problems of agricultural sector development in Nigeria. The program has as one of its major objectives the exploration of simulation as a tool for aiding policy makers of that country concerned with meeting the nutritional needs of the population, generation of foreign exchange earnings and raw material inputs for industrialization, and other important questions relating to long-run development of the agricultural sector and its interaction with nonagricultural development. While the project is localized in a particular country, models are being developed with adaptability to other developing areas of the world as a major objective. To date, a model of the northern region of the country has been developed which will be linked to a southern model currently under construction. The structure of the northern model is described in some detail as an example of the application of simulation to a macroeconomic system. Preliminary tests of this model are discussed and an assessment of the capabilities and limitations of this approach to planning development in emerging countries is given."
"The extraction of features for the purpose of reconstituting a pattern set may be particularly useful in those cases where a large number of patterns can be decomposed into a relatively small set of sub-patterns. By the representation of pattern and feature sets as matrices, the concept of feature determination has been extended to multilevel features and the hierarchical organization of logical networks employing these features. An algorithm is presented to sequentially generate features by an adaptive process of altering weights in a network of thresholdlike logical elements. Experimental results indicate the potential of the algorithm in organizing a recognition network to correspond to the information structure of the pattern set."
"An important practical constraint on admissible control policies is defined for the Markov decision process. The framework of an algorithm based on the infinite return optimization algorithms of Howard and Jewell is suggested to compute the optimal policy under this constraint. Iterative convergence to the optimal policy cannot be guaranteed, but techniques proposed for state-space reduction and rapid resolution of undetermined policies should render many problems tractable."
"A method of classifying patterns using fuzzy relations is described. To start with, we give a suitable value of the measure of subjective similarity to each pair of patterns that is taken from the population of patterns to be classified. Then a similitude between any two patterns is calculated by using the composition of a fuzzy relation. The similitude induces an equivalence relation. Consequently, we can classify the present population of the patterns into some classes by the equivalence relation. An experiment of the classification of portraits has been performed to test the method proposed here."
"The theoretical basis of our experimental approach to information rate and capacity in a crayfish photoreceptor nerve channel is that used by Shannon [16]. Dispersion curves of conduction times were studied for pulses following short, medium, and long intervals. Although the means were equal (2.6 ms), the standard deviation in the case of pulses following short intervals was larger (0.29 ms) than for medium or long intervals (0.18 and 0.21 ms, respectively). A statistical description of nerve-fiber noise was found and used to compute the information rates (İ = 280, 140, and 80 bit/s) for various light intensities. By maximizing İ over all possible input interval distributions, the channel capacity was calculated to be 360 bit/s. Extending the channel to include the entire system defined from light stimulus to probabilistic behavioral output, the overall mutual information rate was estimated to be 0.04 bit/s, the discrepancy between this overall behavioral rate and the capacity of the nerve channel is noted."
"Planning for economic and social purposes often requires choosing among alternative proposed systems to fulfill particular needs. In order to make such choices, planners or decision makers must be able to predict and evaluate the performance of each alternative system. For complex systems, methods are often available for doing this when system inputs, such as system user characteristics, can be specified deterministically. The more general situation, of course, is that input characteristics are not known with certainty, but may be described by probability distributions. It is the latter case that is discussed here. A Bayesian method for choosing among alternative systems when input characteristics are uncertain is presented. The method involves generating ``sample best choices'' among alternative systems. This is accomplished by selecting random input values, converting these to sample outputs for each system, and determining the sample best choice on the basis of the sample output values. The random input values are drawn from a probability distribution that encodes the uncertain state of information on inputs. The sample best choices are viewed as random samples of a multinomial random process whose parameters are also not known with certainty. The generation of random sample choices improves the state of knowledge of the uncertain multinomial parameters and permits a better decision. An optimal sampling policy may be found by executing a dynamic programming computation that balances the cost of sampling against the expected gains from improving the state of information."
 "The results of the above paper,1 concerning a simulation study of an adaptive pattern classification procedure using a mean-square error performance criterion and using an estimated Bayes rule procedure, are compared with theoretical solutions obtained by using an exact Bayes rule procedure. An inherent defect of the mean-square error criterion is also pointed out, and a comparison between a system using this criterion and two other systems is made."
"Self-organizing control (SOC) is analyzed as a conventional controller and the evolution of adaptive SOC from a simple linear system is shown. The development intentionally avoids any reference to the bionics concepts which Barron uses to describe his system."
"Stochastic transition matrices are a convenient means for describing the behavior of adaptive and learning systems. Several systems which utilize these matrices and associated reinforcement (reward and punishment) techniques have been reported. A training algorithm is described which has been applied to a learning system described by stochastic transition matrices in which the environment was unknown a priori and nonstationary."
"A linear programming method for obtaining separating hyperplanes is discussed. Depending upon the objective function, the algorithm will accept any separating hyperplane or one which satisfies a minimum distance criterion. Application to inconsistent, i.e., linearly nonseparable, systems is considered."
"A method for computing the generalized inverse A+ and the associated projections AA+ and A+A for any matrix A is developed It is also shown that the trace of a sequence of approximations to AA+ (or A+A) converges to the rank of A. Finally, examples are given showing the computation of the generalized inverse and rank."
"The problem of reconstructing binary patterns from their shadows or projections is treated. Two algorithms are formulated. For the two-view case, both algorithms give a perfect reconstruction if and only if the pattern is two-view unambiguous. It is also shown that n views are sufficient, but not necessary, to reconstruct any n × n binary pattern. Experimental results for the four-view reconstruction of 25 × 25 binary patterns indicate that one of the algorithms has good convergency behavior."

 "The development of the concept of an operating surface of a measuring system yields as deductively derived special cases, the unbalance, reference-balance, null-balance, unbalance comparison, differential, and directional measurement methods. These apparently unrelated measurement methods now appear as special cases of a new general concept, which is a powerful tool in system analysis and design. The only differences between these apparently widely different methods are the boundary conditions on energy flow through the system."
"An automatic test system is composed of parts that are basically refined versions of standard measurement and test instruments. The instruments used in the automatic test system must be automatically programmable to provide the stimulus or measurement range called for by the test program and they must be capable of receiving these programmed instructions from a computer or controller that serves as the test interpreter, director, and decision maker for the test system. Another characteristic of an automatic test system is that it requires its test instruments to be capable of being connected in any desirable electrical configuration by the test systems switching matrix. The final requirement of a test system is that it have some type of man-machine interface such as a printer or visual display to inform the operator of test results and/or provide him with instructions. The number of automatic test systems in use in Canada and the U. S. today has grown greatly over the last few years. These systems fall into two categories: they are either integrated systems, composed from building blocks of general-purpose programmable measurement and stimulus devices or they are dedicated systems, comprised of specially designed special-purpose stimulus and measurement devices aimed at a specific task. This paper will examine the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to test system design. It will highlight factors that must be considered before choosing either and will illustrate subtle and intangible aspects of this decision, which can prove crucial over the long run."
"This paper describes a processor that is being used for radar and multichannel sonar spectral analysis of band-limited input signals. Its design is based on a shift-register implementation of a fast Fourier transform algorithm coupled with a single flow-through arithmetic unit. In less than 12 ms, 4096 complex input data samples can be transformed, making it one of the faster systems in operation. Speed is obtained by using an organization that performs the rapid data reordering required for executing the algorithm. A postprocessing unit is used to increase quality of estimation of line spectra in statistically random short-term spectra. The unit can be used either as an integrator or first-order recursive filter. It is implemented in a floating-point format to maintain dynamic range. Hardware is kept to a minimum by establishing minimum and maximum ratios of the two signals required in the recursive filter computation."
"This paper describes a complete highly flexible signal conditioning system for matching transducers to readout devices. This system differs from conventional systems, in which a matching channel consists of separately packaged and powered components with interconnecting cables, in that all the components for a matching channel are packaged and powered together in one mainframe that provides the interconnections. The system gains tremendous advantages in flexibility, space, heat production, ``connectorology,'' and cost. Mathematically, any matching channel can be represented by a transfer function that can be analyzed into simpler transfer functions. Conversely, any matching channel can be synthesized by combining appropriate transfer functions. The subject system provides five types of components that provide power supply, input, preamplifier, processor, and dual output transfer functions. In each category, the number of transfer functions for which components can be designed is limited only by the user's imagination. By proper selection of components, the system can be used to match a wide variety of transducers and readout devices. The paper applies the analysis and synthesis techniques to several commonly used matching systems as a means of indicating the flexibility of the subject system."
"An interim data acquisition (IDAC) system was developed and installed in the Environmental Test Laboratory of the Applied Physics Laboratory. This system can scan 200 analog voltages and 400 thermocouples under control of a programmable calculator. The calculator converts the data to engineering units, checks calibration channels for out-of-tolerance and thermocouples for open circuit. Source and channel identification is formatted with the data and printed at the rate of approximately 1 channel/s. Also included in this printout are power-supply wattages calculated from measured voltages and currents, and temperature averages for preselected groups of thermocouples. Out-of-tolerance calibration channels and open thermocouples are flagged when they are printed out. A digital clock provides timed intervals for automatically initiating the data acquisition cycle. Time and test identification data are pointed at the start of each printout to identify test and run numbers."
"A data-acquisition system built around a multiprogrammed SEL-810A digital computer is used by the RCA-Astro-Electronics Division (AED) Environmental Test Center, Princeton, N. J., for the acquisition and processing of quasi-static signals originating from a variety of analog transducers during spacecraft environmental simulation tests. The system gathers analog data with the aid of three mobile instrumentation carts located at the test site and generates data logs for both magnetic tape and hardcopy printout. Because of the slowly varying data, high scan rates were of no particular importance; instead, prime targets were assurance of data integrity, speedy setup operations, accomodation of a large variety of transducers, and order and flexibility in data presentation. System accuracy excluding transducers is 0.25 percent of full scale (FS). Measurement results obtained at 200 channels/s are presented in selectable formats primarily on a line printer directly in engineering units. Three unrelated test activities can be accommodated simultaneously without mutual dependence or interference and a total of 750 channels can be processed. Setup information, test directives, and real-time test monitoring are handled with the aid of interactive communications in English memonics."
"A digital instrument is described that provides decimal readouts of the first four time-averaged moments and of the cumulative amplitude probability of a randomly varying voltage. There is no low-frequency limit, the upper-frequency being limited to about 6 kHz for a 99 percent confidence interval of 1 percent error. Measurements can be made in a one-cycle mode (for periodic inputs) or in a fixed-time or fixed-sample-size mode. Readouts of all the moments are available immediately at the end of the measurement time so that the instrument can be used for real-time applications. The voltage under measurement is sampled systematically and the samples are processed immediately using a weighted-feed logic system. The principles of operation and the design of the instrument are described. For many commonly encountered signals the overall error is within 1 percent for all four moments."
"An automatic level measuring system is described allowing selective voltage and voltage difference measurements with very high accuracy and high measuring speed in a frequency range of 200 Hz to 2 MHz or 10 kHz to 100 MHz. The system includes devices for measuring the reflection coefficient as well as multipoint scanners with low insertion loss and high crosstalk attenuation. All essential functions of the system can be remotely controlled and programmed. The system has a range of 150 dB. The attainable accuracy at absolute measurements is approximately 0.1 dB while the resolution for difference measurements amounts to 0.01 dB. The frequency error is smaller than 5 ?? 10-8. The results are digitally displayed and are also available as binary coded decimal (BCD) signals. To control the system and to evaluate the results (e.g., comparison with present tolerance limits, classification quality ranges), a fixed-program small computer is provided that can be fed with additional information from a punched tape or core memory. The measuring sets will most frequently be used in development, production, and maintenance areas in the field of telecommunications, but are also of general interest where high accuracy combined with high measuring speed is essential. Attainable time saving depends on the problem in question and may be of the order of 10-100."
"Since 1967, computer-controlled test systems have been used with great success for the rapid and automatic test and evaluation of parameters of multiconductor telephone cables ranging in lengths from 200 to 20 000 ft. These parameters are important in the design and manufacture of cables by determining transmission efficiency, crosstalk, and noise. These systems have evolved into a second-generation version with improvements in measurement techniques and operational utility. In addition to measurements of mutual capacitance, capacitance unbalance to ground, and pair-to-pair, measurements of capacitance unbalance to shield and resistance parameters such as mutual conductance, conductor resistance, and resistance unbalance can now be made with the same system. This paper describes the structure of these automatic systems and some of the current and future capabilities."
"The small astronomy satellite (SAS-A) was placed into earth orbit in December 1970 with one experiment designed to scan the celestial sphere for sources of X-ray emission. An automated test procedure was used to confirm proper operation of all the experiment sensors and electronics prior to launch of the spacecraft. The testing that had to be conducted over the operational spacecraft telemetry and command channels from a remote location was automated by use of a general-purpose computer system. The computer was programmed to set the experiment into a predetermined configuration of sensor and electronic activation by commanding the spacecraft to turn on specific X-ray and electronic pulsetrain sources external to the experiment by commanding a source control unit, and to receive, decommutate, and process the telemetered experiment data from the spacecraft to produce a summary printout of test results for the experiment checkout engineer. The automated testing worked very well, greatly reducing the total time required to check out thoroughly the experiment portion of the spacecraft and allowing a comprehensive test and calibration of the experiment to be run during the actual launch countdown."
"The evaluation of signal propagation delay in multiple-input multiple-output digital circuits can be very time consuming. For a circuit with n inputs there are 2n different input address states and 2n(2n - 1) different input address state transitions, each of which may result in a different propagation-delay time. A circuit-delay tester has been designed and built to test signal propagation delay automatically and at high speed for all possible input state transitions. While designed primarily for testing high-speed integrated read-only memories, other applications are also possible. The tester drives up to 10 inputs and checks up to 4 outputs with continuously variable input voltage levels and output voltage thresholds. The operating speed is 1 ??s per input address transition (i.e., about 0.25 s for a complete test of a 4 ?? 256-bit ROM), while an address transition rate of 10-MHz max is simulated. The propagation-delay measurement range is 15-100 ns with an accuracy of ?? 1 ns. The tested delays are either compared against a preset value and a pass-fail status is indicated or the largest delay is located, measured, and displayed. Also, any desired input address transition can be manually selected and the related delay measured. Operation of the circuit-delay tester does not require knowledge of the logic contents of the device under test."
"The test system provides facilities for determining the range of satisfactory operating parameters of a memory with high accuracy, in a short time, under program control. The system performs its overall control by a miniature computer; it makes memory write-and readout tests, judges the quality while changing various electrical conditions in the memory equipment, and displays the operating area with variation of the parameters as a graph on an X-Y plotter and a cathode-ray-tube (CRT) screen. Among its features, the system provides means for setting the logic levels for measurement, simultaneously setting up many parameters, processing the measured data through arithmetic operation, and in addition allows flexibility in the output methods as well as opportunity for expansion of the measuring system. Two programs are available for the boundary area tracing and the complete area scanning through the use of an algorithm featuring high measuring efficiency and stability. Development of the present system has made it possible not only to evaluate memories in detail but also to gather valuable data for the design of memories."
"The technique described uses a series of impedance measurements with different lead combinations and a calculation to determine the impedance of an unknown in the presence of lead and loading impedances. In general, a four-terminal ac or dc measurement requires four leads, four switches, and a series of five two-terminal measurements. However, an ac bridge is shown that requires only two switches and three measurements. The impedance of the swithces used to select the lead combinations has no effect on the measurement if it is constant and changes in switch resistance between closures can be avoided by choosing a measurement sequence that closes each switch only once. Most guarded four-terminal bridges are subject to errors caused by impedance to guard at the unknown end of the leads. A series of seven three-terminal measurements corrects for this type of error, which is particularly important for in situ measurements or for high-precision measurements on three-terminal standards. The technique is particularly applicable to an automatic computerized devide because two-terminal automatic bridges are substantially simpler than four-terminal bridges and because the speed of such a system and its computer can easily overcome the main disadvantages of the method???the necessity for several measurements and the calculation (which includes square roots). However, three two-terminal measurements and a simple calculation will measure a four-terminal impedance with a residual error that can be very small if the lead impedances are approximately equal. Thus the method may be practical for manual measurements as well."
"A description is given of the system currently in use at the National Bureau of Standards for measurements of 1-?? standard resistors of the Thomas type. A tenfold improvement in accuracy over the former method has been realized. Resistors of this type are now reported to eight decimal places with a total uncertainty of 0.08 ppm. The latter figure includes a three-standard-deviation limit for random errors plus an estimate of systematic errors [1]. The new system is not only more rapid in operation than the old one (fewer man hours required), but has consistently produced data of superior resolution while operating with a lower test power in resistors. A dc current-linkage balance is used to determine the standard-unknown differences while both are connected in series and totally immersed in a specially designed circular oil bath, which remains completely covered during all tests. Bath temperature is maintained constantly at 25 000?? (??0.003??C) in a unique manner."
"A new high-precision guarded volt box providing output voltages of 1.5 V for all input voltage ranges up to a maximum of 1500 V with ranges selected by a single rotary switch for tap changing is described. The design, test results, field experience, as well as the effects of voltage ratio errors, resistance value drift with time, self-heating errors, leakage errors, rod resistance, and temperature coefficients are discussed."
"The fundamental equation for evaluating the hysteresis losses Ph = ??? H dB, transformed for the use of electrical units and approximated as numeric integral Ph = W1/W2 2/1mA ???? -J ??+J J is sufficiently correct ???? is constant and very small. By continuously changing the magnetizing current in the primary winding w1 of Epstein frames or ring cores (electronically controlled so that the induced voltage in the secondary winding W2 does not exceed a fixed limit) the flux ?? can be determined by means of a voltage-to-frequency-converter that generates a pulse train whose frequency is proportional to the input voltage and summing the pulses with an electronic counter. These pulses are scaled to groups of constant number (representing ???? = constant) by means of a preset counter that generates trigger pulses giving commands to a sample and hold digital voltmeter in order to measure the instantaneous values of the current as voltage drop across a standard resistor in the primary circuit. An electronic adder with Nixie display totalizes the current values according to the sign. The measuring procedure takes about 40 s, the accuracy is in the order of some parts in 1000."
"In order to determine the ac properties of laminated magnetic-core materials, a digital assembly has been developed to measure the mean half-period value nearly independent of frequency. Conventional integrating digital voltmeters are unsuitable for such measurements if the frequency fs of the unknown voltage does not fit the equation fs?? To = ``integer,'' where To is the integrating time of the DVM. This error can be reduced considerably by the designed double-integration method. A FET switch supplies the analog signal to a low drift integrator generating a dc output corresponding to the voltage-time integral over n periods (n = integer). The signal switch is triggered internally by the unknown voltage or externally by one or two reference signals of the same frequency. Thus it is possible to sample any interval of the unknown voltage by appropriate phase shifting. The integrator dc-output voltage is converted to a proportional frequency, which is fed to a counter with variable gate time Tm. If the signal frequency f8 = 1 / T8 = (n + k)/To, (-1/ 2 ??? k ??? + 1/2), Tm will be reduced or increased by kTs. The systematic error is a function of (k/f)2. The overall accuracy in the frequency range 25 Hz-1 kHz and the voltage range 15 mV-7.5 V is better than 5-10???4. Additionally, the equipment measures the arithmetic mean and, with an internal dc reference, the angle between the zero crossings of two voltages."
"The EEMTIC meeting on Wednesday afternoon, June 2, 1971, was devoted to a discussion of standards, their nature, their creation, and the role they play in industry and commerce. The session consisted of five formal talks, which were presented following an introductory statement by the session chairman, Mr. Frank L. Hermach of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards. At the conclusion of the fifth paper, while the speakers were going to the rostrum for a round-table discussion, Mr. Andrew F. Dunn was asked by Mr. Hermach to give a brief talk on the Canadian Standards Association. Mr. Dunn's remarks are included as though they had been an official paper. The session was recorded, and the published papers represent a synthesis of the editor's and the authors' reviews of the tape. The discussion following the formal talks has been condensed somewhat. The editor assumes full responsibility for the report of the discussion, and hopes the gist, if not the entirety, of each speaker's remarks has been preserved intact."
"An automatic data gathering and processing system for ??600-kV direct-current test lines at the National Research Council of Canada is described. The data consist of corona-loss current, radio interference, meteorological information, line voltage, and real time. The system consists of a 16-channel analog multiplexer, an A/D converter, a real-time clock, and a teletypewriter. All data are recorded on magnetic tape in IBM compatible format. A small stored-program digital computer controls the data system. The reasons for choosing the computer-controlled system for this application, a description of instrumentation for measuring the weather variables, and methods for telemetering corona-loss current information across the high-voltage barrier are included."
"A self-balancing instrument transformer testing device is described by which the voltage and current errors and phase displacements of instrument transformers can be read off or recorded directly with a printer or digital instrument. The circuitry correr sponds to the usual difference circuit in which the test transforme- is compared with a standard transformer. The voltage difference between the secondary voltages of the test and the standard transformer is balanced by a voltage that is separated into two components, one being in phase with the voltage of the standard transformer (reference voltage) and the other in quadrature. The direct voltages with which the reference voltages are multiplied to generate the balancing voltage are a measure of the errors and the phase displacements of the instrument transformers. The circuits generating the reference voltages, the zero voltage amplifier, the phase-selective rectifier, and the multiplier circuit are described. The device is designed for measuring the errors of current transformers between 1 and 200 percent of rated current and the errors of voltage transformers between 40 and 120 percent of the rated voltage, to an accuracy of about 1 percent of full scale. It may also be used to measure the impedance of resistors, inductors, and capacitors."
"A phase-sensitive detector is described that enables the retrieval of signals submerged 90 dB (voltage) below the noise level. Operation over four decades of signal amplitude (a fullscale linearity error of 0.01 percent) is possible for a frequency range of 0-150 Hz. Design features are offered allowing an experimenter to construct the device from inexpensive components and be assured a predictable performance."
"The application of a commercially available component (Misto-R multiplier by American Aerospace Conntrols Inc.) to accurate power measurement over the audio frequenncy range is investigated. It is shown that the errors inherent to the magnetoresistive component can be considerably reduced by appropriate electronic circuitry. Two circuits were constructed and tested: a dc circuit and an ac circuit. The accuracy of the dc multiplier is better than 0.05 percent of full scale. The accuracy of the ac multiplier at a power factor of 1.0 is better than 0.1 percent of full scale up to a frequency of 4000 Hz and approaches 0.5 percent at 10 kHz. Expressions for static and dynamic errors are given and it is shown that the static errors are small with respect to the dynamic errors. It is believed that further broadening of the frequency and power factor ranges for the specified accuracy of 0.1 percent can be achieved by modifying the structure of the bridge and adopting suitable circuitry."
"This paper describes a new type of power-frequency converter with an electronic measuring device. It is of the three-phase four-wire type and was developed in the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) especially for the precision measuring of electrical energy in high-voltage circuits. It has an accuracy of 10-3 over a current range of 1: 100. The measuring elements use the time-division principle. The wide current range is achieved by commutating the charging current for the integrating circuit. The running (indication) of the instrument with no load is eliminated. The specifications are much better than those of a high-precision rotor-type meter of class 0.5 (Recommendations of the International Electrotechnical Commission-IEC)."
"A new approach to ac-to-dc conversion is presented, with applicability both to phase-sensitive rectification and to whole-signal determination. In the former case, it provides insensitivity to effects of signal distortion up to any desired harmonic number, with elimination of effects up to the tenth harmonic a practical possibility. In the whole-signal situation with reasonable amounts of distortion, applying the method reduces effects of harmonics up to the tenth as well. In the whole-signal implementation, the computation yields an excellent approach to true rms, for sinusoidal waves with reasonable amounts of harmonic contamination, and for a wide range of other signals as well, including square and triangular waves. Most significantly, performance capabilities of the new converters include speed and dynamic range as well as accuracy. A converter for 400 Hz and higher settles in 110 ms; for 60 Hz and higher, in 400 ms???both much faster than rms converters using thennal devices. Dynamic range exceeds 60 dB."
"A class of transducer oscillators is characterized by a tuning method that exchanges short-term for long-term stability. The nonlinear effects of the internal noise, when the tuning method is used with a four-element RC feedback network, is analyzed using the principle of slowly varying phase and amplitude. The short-term stability for both white and flicker noise is given. Theoretical expressions are compared with practical measurements."
"A broad-band microwave measurement system has been designed to measure envelope delay distortion on a swept basis at millimeter-wave carrier frequencies. The delay scanner ultilizes the envelope phase-shift technique with a 10-MHz envelope frequency to measure delay distortion. The set operates from 40 to 110 GHz in three waveguide bands. The accuracy of delay distortion measurements is 30 ps with a resolution of 10 ps and the measurement accuracy for insertion-loss distortions is 0.08 dB with a resolution of 0.01 dB. The delay scanner meets the stated accuracy for unknowns with an insertion loss less than 10 dB. The measurement system features signal averaging for random noise reduction and baseline subtraction. The paper gives an electrical description of the delay scanner and discusses in some detail those operating principles and design approaches that were used to minimize measurement errors. Overall performance characteristics are summarized with a listing of error contributions."
"A broad-band microwave measurement system has been designed to make insertion-loss measurements on a swept basis at millimeter wave frequencies. This instrument covers a frequency range of 33-110 GHz in three waveguide circuits, using WR-22, WR-15, and WR-10 waveguide components. Small variations in loss can be displayed and measured with a resolution of ??0.01 dB and an accuracy of ??0.08 dB while sweeping over frequency ranges as wide as 10 GHz. Insertion losses up to 60 dB can be measured with an accuracy of two percent for losses greater than 10 dB. Straighta way video detection techniques are employed. An interesting feature of the millimeter loss scanner is that random noise is averaged to insignificance and the test-set residual loss or baseline is automatically subtracted. The resultant output display is the actual insertion loss of the network under test along with any calibration lines that may be desired. This stored output can be displayed on an oscilloscope and photographed, read out on an X-Y plotter, or transmitted in either digital or analog form to a computer for further processing or analysis."
"The milliwatt test set, model EPM-1 provides precise level measurements in the frequency range 10 Hz to 100 MHz or 300 MHz with somewhat reduced specifications. In order to attain the highest accuracy, the measurement range is reduced to a narrow spread on both sides of a 0-dBm center value. The instrument consists of the basic unit and a test probe connected directly to the point of measurement. Thus, errors that might be caused by a pickup cable are eliminated. Measurement is made by a thermocouple protected from burnout by a phototransistor overload sensor. The instrument may also be used as a constant-output amplifier. Methods of calibration, choice of impedance levels, and applications are discussed."
"A method is described for microwave permittivity measurements of anisotropic sheet dielectrics, especially of thin copper-clad laminates. The accuracy is calculating the permittivity is not dependent on measurement of specimen thickness. All exposed dielectric surfaces of a precisely machined disk (the edge only of disks of double copper-clad laminates) are preferably electroplated with copper to provide a resonant cavity completely filled with dielectric. By means of a special coupling fixture and smal openings provided in the conductive coating, the TMn10 no resonances are excited and identified. The frequencies of these modes are independent of disk thickness. Permittivity is determined by dividing a constant calculated for each mode by the square of the resonant frequency. Constants and other data for the first 17 modes of a 1.000-in (2.540-cm)-diameter cavity are given together with some experimental results."
"This paper presents a new type variable high resistance suitable for use over a very high frequency range. The variable resistance is composed of three parallel low-loss dielectric plates with thin metal film electrodes. The intermediate plate is mechanically movable parallel to the other plates to form a variable series condenser. The variable series condenser is then combined with a resistance of a fixed value so as to act as a variable high resistance ranging from about 104-1013 ?? depending on the operating frequency. Some characteristics of this device at 100 MHz are described."

"This paper describes the radio astronomy instrument flown on both Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatories II and IV (OGO-II and OGO-IV). The instrument was designed to map the brightness distribution of cosmic noise over the sky at 2.0 and 2.5 MHz by using the theoretically predicted ionospheric focusing of an electrically short antenna. An antenna impedance bridge was included as a necessary part of the system. The system is unusual because the impedance bridge and the 2.5-MHz radiometer operate simultaneously at the same frequency. OGO-II was launched on October 14, 1965, and the instrument operated normally until the spacecraft was turned off November 1, 1967. During this period the instrument was operated for 4495 hours with many on-off cycles. OGO-IV was launched July 28, 1967, and the instrument operated properly for 18 330 hours prior to termination of spacecraft operations on October 23, 1969. Results of these experiments are published separately [5], [6]."
"The degree and orders of nonlinearity of a system can be determined by the use of a random test signal. A Gaussian-distributed random signal with a uniform power spectral density except for a narrow spectral notch is used as an input test signal. The power within the notch at the system output is a measure of the degree of system nonlinearity. Relative variations of the output power within the notch with input loading identify the orders of nonlinearity."
"A variation of the pulse method of junction temperature measurement is presented. The new technique allows the junction temperature of diodes and transistors under stress test to be monitored by a simple procedure. An expression for correcting junction to case thermal resistances, obtained via the steady-state hrb method, for nonthermal effects is derived. Both of these ideas are illustrated by an example."
"Consider a signal generator whose instantaneous output voltage V(t) may be written as V(t) = [V0 + ??(t)] sin [2??v0t + s(t)] where V0 and v0 are the nominal amplitude and frequency, respectively, of the output. Provided that ??(t) and ??(t) = (d??/(dt) are sufficiently small for all time t, one may define the fractional instantaneous frequency deviation from nominal by the relation y(t) - ??(t)/2??vo A proposed definition for the measure of frequency stability is the spectral density Sy(f) of the function y(t) where the spectrum is considered to be one sided on a per hertz basis. An alternative definition for the measure of stability is the infinite time average of the sample variance of two adjacent averages of y(t); that is, if yk = 1/t ??? tk+r = y(tk) y(t) dt where ?? is the averaging period, tk+1= tk + T, k = 0, 1, 2 ..., t0 is arbitrary, and T is the time interval between the beginnings of two successive measurements of average frequency; then the second measure of stability is ??y2(??) ??? (yk+1 - yk)2/2 where denotes infinite time average and where T = ??. In practice, data records are of finite length and the infinite time averages implied in the definitions are normally not available; thus estimates for the two measures must be used. Estimates of Sy(f) would be obtained from suitable averages either in the time domain or the frequency domain."
"A simple voltage-to-time converter having a high linearity of time/voltage relationship is described. This circuit consists of one monostable multivibrator with a constant current source. The circuit does not have a ramp generator and a voltage comparator. The linearity error of the time/voltage relationship is less than ??0.05 percent for a voltage variation from 0.5 to 14 V."
"An inexpensive wide-band amplifier suitable for driving many piezoelectric transducers encountered in underwater sound propagation studies and laser research is described. Small signal bandwidth is dc to 5 MHz, with large signal response determined by a slew rate limit of 800 V/??s, at maximum output voltage and current of 280 V peak-to-peak and 1 A."

"A general method for automatically plotting a function of many variables is described. The variables, as analog signals, are sampled by a voltage-sensor circuit, and data are recorded only when the variables are at predetermined values. Presentation is on an intensity modulated X-Y oscilloscope. Thus if y = y(x1, x2, ..., xn), then graphical displays can be made of y versus any two variables, with the remaining variables at fixed predetermined values. Mathematical inversion is possible, and solutions obtained for xp(x1,..., xp-1, xp+1,...,xn, y) as a function of y and any one of the other variables, and the inversion need not be single valued. Examples of two-dimensional and three-dimensional displays are given, with the axes rotated and viewed from different ``perspectives.''"
"A method of measuring peak voltage of an impulse by a cascaded two-stage pulse-lengthener circuit followed by a source follower is described. The method permits the measurement of the peak voltage of an impulse with a width as narrow as 15 ns. The measurable peak voltage ranges from +1 to +5 V. The 1 percent decay time of the meter reading is about 5 s. The meter can therefore be read without hurry."
"This paper describes an experiment designed to evaluate the accuracy of one-way clock synchronization using geostationary satellites with the propagation delays calculated from the satellite's orbital elements. Propagation delays from a ground transmitter via satellite to each of five locations in the North and South American continents were measured and compared with the calculated values. Three months of data are presented along with descriptions of the equipment, timing signal format, and methods for delay calculation and time recovery. The results show that within two weeks of epoch for the orbital elements, clocks can be synchronized to 150 ??s using the Tactical Communications Satellite (TACSAT). If one of the observers of the timing signals was already synchronized to the master clock, his delay measurement could improve the results for TACSAT to 75 ??s. By the same method and within 12 hours of epoch, the results for the Lincoln Experimental Satellite-6 (LES-6) indicated that synchronization to 25 ??s was possible."
"Functioning time of an explosive device can be defined as the first indication of light output after the application of a stimulus. A technique based on the use of fiber optics in conjunction with an optical sensor and amplifier is described."
"The frequency stability is analyzed for a voltage-controlled grounded-base crystal oscillator by matrix algebra. The validity of the resulting equation was verified by measurements on an oscillator with a 110-MHz fifth-overtone quartz crystal. Sensitivity coefficients for the oscillator are computed with the aid of a time share computer program and its sweep range is drawn by a plotting routine."
"This paper describes a theoretical and practical investigation of the effect of the losses in a sliding short and associated line, using the G-reflectometer measuring technique for the determination of small losses. The evaluation of the modified measuring method is based on Engen's method for the description of microwave systems. Practical examples are included."
"High-precision measurements of capacitance and dissipation factor can be made without capacitor standards using active circuits known as gyrators, which are constructed with high-gain operational amplifiers and precision resistors. A theoretical analysis of the technique is carried out here using one particular gyrator circuit. A preliminary experimental study yielded values of dissipation factor, which agreed with measurements made by the manufacturer of the precision capacitors tested to within four parts per million. The theory suggests that with a more carefully engineered instrument, capacitors of 0.01-1 ??F in the 10-1000 Hz range may be measured with an accuracy of the order of 1-2 ppm. The accuracy appears to be determined primarily by the precision of two critical resistors in the gyrator."
"A technique is described that has made it possible to build a multichannel analyzer with the final resolution determined by a set of identical filters rather than a series of different filters."
"The use of I-V characteristics to determine the behavior of active devices is increasing. The standard swept frequency schemes suffer from frequency limitations. A technique for pulsed I-V measurements that can be employed in most laboratories is described and its application to measuring the active behavior of an IMPATT device is demonstrated."

"Many of the problems involved in maintaining a laboratory reference group of standard cells with a reliability better than one part per million are outlined and solutions suggested. Methods are presented for reducing the number of measurements by approximately 40 percent from the ideal without seriously reducing the accuracy achieved, and procedures for assessing the quality of the group are indicated. Suggestions are given for preferred methods to be used for groups of 4, 8, or 12 cells, and as an example of these procedures the 20-month history of a new group of standard cells is illustrated."
"The problems of mode purity and the interaction effect generally necessitate a large insertion loss in precision waveguide-below-cutoff (piston) attenuators to obtain a linear output. An attenuator excitation system, used on a precision attenuation measuring system, that reduces these problems is described. Experimental work as well as theoretical considerations are discussed and designs are presented that have produced out-put voltages of the piston attenuator greater than 1 V while still maintaining a linearity of 0.001 dB as a function of piston position. This has been accomplished by 1) operating with large input power (100-200 W), 2) development of new exciting units with improved geometry for better field excitation and utilizing water-cooled elements for high-power operation, 3) special impedance matching networks having exceptional stability with high power input, 4) use of current feedback to achieve effectively constant current excitation, and 5) a mode filter that attenuates the undesired TM01 mode 98 dB while attenuating the desired TE11 mode only 0.2 dB."
"The criteria for the optinum design of a low-zero-drift thermocouple element for coaxial line power measurement is established. A procedure is presented for determining the thermoelectric voltages of a circuit and the geometric design of the element. The thermal and electrical resistivity of the component parts of the element are derived."
"A review of progress in laser stabilization techniques and laser frequency measurement is given. Methods for relating laser frequencies to the time standard and methods for absolute laser frequency stabilization are described. Experimental information on reproducibility and noise characteristics is reported. Application to frequency and wavelength standards is discussed."
"A two-way microwave link between the Naval Research Laboratory and the Naval Observatory has been established to transfer both time and frequency information with high accuracy. Time and frequency information are transmitted simultaneously by algebraically adding together a precision 1-MHz signal and 1 pps, thus providing continuous phase information for frequency comparison and epoch time by the pulse. Phase resolution is better than 10 ns and determination of epoch time better than 0.1 ??s. Seven precision standards have been intercompared via the microwave link. Continuous phase recording since September 1969 has shown no diumal dependence and very little effect due to seasonal and temperature changes. A second microwave link has been established between the Naval Observatory and the Naval Research Laboratory's satellite research communications terminal in Waldorf, Md."
"This paper describes a new modulation and servo system that is being tested in the NRC long-beam cesium-frequency standard. Square-wave frequency modulation is employed; it is introduced by switching between two separately generated frequencies. The synthesizer producing these frequencies and the problems caused by switching transients are described. Since in a laboratory standard systematic errors play a very important role these errors are discussed in the description of the servo system. The resulting systematic error as calculated from results of experiments on its components is less than 1 part in 1013."
"What is the relationship that exists between an ionization chamber's current and the atmosphere to which it is exposed and what are the important considerations in ionization chamber design? The objective of this paper is to provide an answer to this question so that an ionization chamber type sensor can be designed to determine changes in the composition of a gas. The theory of ionization chamber operation and design is presented along with a complete derivation of the coaxial- and parallel-plate ionization chamber current equations. The paper is brought to a conclusion with a practical design example in which the ionization chamber sensor is used to detect the presence of aerosols in the air during the incipient stage of a combustion process."
"Polar-display instantaneous-frequency meters are finding increasing application as frequency monitor receivers and as modulation analyzers. These systems indicate signal frequency by the angular coordinate of a cathode-ray-tube spot and signal amplitude by the radial coordinate. This paper derives the responses (spot loci) produced by signals of interest, including the sum of two sinusoids, amplitude-modulated carriers, angle-modulated carriers, and carriers with combined amplitude and angle modulation. Differences between actual responses and responses expected from a static analysis are studied. Conditions under which the amplitudes and frequencies of two simultaneously applied sinusoids can and can not be determined from the display are derived."
"In the existing art, the description and evaluation of microwave systems is usually in terms of the complex wave amplitudes in the (assumed) uniform waveguide by which the components are interconnected. The interrelationships among these amplitudes are given by the scattering equations or indirectly by impedance parameters. This paper introduces an alternative description, based on power equations, where the basic parameter is the net power in the waveguide of interest. Compared with the circuit description, there is a substantial suppression of detail and the remaining parameters are placed in better perspective. In particular, the technique provides a simplified method of describing and evaluating mismatch corrections, in which the precision connector and uniform waveguide requirements have been eliminated."
"A microwave refractometer is described in which the usual reference cavity is replaced by a stable quartz-crystal oscillator. Direct digital readout of refractive index with least count of 0.01 N unit is provided."
 "A computer program has been developed for optimum design of dc measuring instruments that use the D'Arsonval mechanism. The computer selects specific components, mostly from a standard set, to produce an optimum design satisfying given performance specifications and constraints. The program allows the designer to interact with the computer and limit the choices available to it. It also enables the designer to conduct a number of useful design studies without having to build and test a large number of prototypes. The program can be accessed from a remote terminal and gives the answers very readily resulting in a substantial saving in engineering time."
"A twelve-frame 38 mm ?? 4 mm high-speed image converter camera is described. The exposure times can be step varied between 50 ns and 100 ms and the time interval between the first two frames step varied from 100 ns to 100 ms. The frame sequence can be chosen to be linear or geometrical."
"This paper presents a direct-reading method for the nonlinearity index of silicon carbide varistor. Varistors of voltage rated from 50 V to 700 V can be measured without range switching. Measurement is made either at 0.1 and 1 mA or 1 and 10 mA of the varistor current. Precalibration is made by using an ordinary resistor. Measurement accuracy is -3 percent."
"This paper describes a modification to a conventional Q meter that permits direct measurement of Q in low-impedance tank circuits. The Q-meter voltage source was replaced by a wide-band current transformer operated in reverse, thereby lowering the instrument's insertion resistance from 0.02 to 0.0002 ohm."
"In this paper temperature-compensation systems in compensated pressure transducers with Zener piezodiodes are considered from the viewpoint of the pressure sensitivity obtained."
"Equipment for evaluating the relative roughness (or smoothness) of a road surface is described. Although the equipment was developed primarily for investigation of various types and patterns of rumble strips for traffic control, it could also be applied to the evaluation of street or highway pavement conditions. The equipment measures the vertical movement of the rear axle of the test vehicle with respect to the frame of the vehicle in 0.125-in increments. Each increment of movement is converted into an electrical pulse. The pulses are accumulated with an electronic counter throughout a test run with the vehicle. The magnitude of the resulting total count is an indication of the relative roughness of the tested surface."
"A method is described to achieve the current amplification of an amplifier equal to ex, x being the angle of rotation of an axis. The systematic error is lower than 1 percent for |x| < 0.5. This device, used for the analog recording of the neutron monitor1 counting rate, solves the equation N(po) = N(p)??ex."
"The ability to manufacture large-scale-integration (LSI) systems necessitated our building a special type of test set. The set is capable of controlling test equipment to produce measurements, storing the results, performing arithmetic operations on the results, and then carrying out logical decisions. The set contains a PDP8/S computer to which is interfaced a teletype unit, an A/D converter, various power supplies, voltage and current measuring modules, a prober, and a matrix for inter-connecting the test equipment to the prober. All of these interfaced units are under computer control. Most of the interfaced units are of standard design, however, because of the incompatibility of logic levels and coding, a fairly complex DTL interface medium had to be constructed. Software associated with this test set consists of programs that perform the functions of peripheral control, electronic function block testing, and data analysis. The results of the data analysis are used to automatically select a working element in each group on the LSI slice. A simple language has been devised to facilitate the use of this library of routines."
 "Interference between two axially separated and crossed hot wires has been found. The effect was caused by the hot wake of the upstream wire and the effect of the wake could still be detected even after 4 ?? 103 diameters downstream."

"THE 1971 International Microwave Symposium was held in Washington, D. C, on May 17-19 at the Marriott Twin Bridges Motel. The Symposium, in spite of the present economic situation, was both a technical and a financial success. A total registration of 460 was obtained. The success of the Symposium is attributable in part to the hard work of the Symposium Steering Committee, H. W. Cooper, Chairman, and the strong local support from engineers in the Baltimore-Washington area."
"THE G-MTT National Lectureship was initiated in 1967 specifically to provide assistance to chapters by providing a prominent speaker on a current microwave topic. Emphasis is placed on aiding new chapters and small chapters located in areas where speakers are not readily available. The goals established for the National Lectureship are to stimulate chapter growth, provide a greater dissemination of current technical information, and establish stronger bonds between the chapters and the National Group. A budget of $2000 per year is provided to cover, or partially defray, the expenses of the National Lecturer. Typically, the National Lecturer will speak at 10-15 chapters during his one-year tenure. Past Lecturers are Harold Sobol (1970), Richard W. Damon (1969), Leo Young (1968), and Arthur A. Oliner (1967). The 1971 National Lecturer is Carl Blake, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington. His lecture summary follows."
"Bias-voltage and frequency dependencies of large signal electronic admittance of a Gunn diode have been measured systematically in the 8- to 13-GHz frequency range. The results were qualitatively verified by computer simulation. These results furnished information which was useful in the direct design of broad-band injection-locked oscillators and amplifiers. The results also gave a better understanding of irregular phenomena commonly observed in conventional oscillators."
"Analyses are carried out by using a simplified model of the dynamic current-voltage characteristic of the Gunn diode oscillator. Experiments have been also carried out. For the self-excited mixers, an external signal was injected into the oscillator instead of the signal reflected by the reflector. For the effects of the moving reflector upon the oscillation frequency and dc current were investigated in the static condition."
"Two high-efficiency avalanche diodes, each placed in opposite polarity to the other at the ends of an approximately one-half wavelength transmission line, have worked as a high-power reflection-type amplifier. The circuit configuration is called an antiparallel pair of high-efficiency avalanche diodes. The antiparallel amplifier has provided 200-W pulsed output power with a 10-dB gain at 1.01 GHz."
"A computer-aided design approach is developed for the analysis and design of single-tuned parametric amplifiers. The voltage gain- bandwidth product (√G̅B) is used as a maximizing objective function for the optimum design. An 18-GHz single-tuned amplifier using a single-packaged varactor diode is designed as an illustration. The experimental amplifier exhibited a large √G̅B of 2400 MHz and a low noise temperature of 180°K at room temperature ambient."
"The use of a class of periodic structures in the design of low-cost ferrite remanence phase shifters is reported. A loading factor is developed to show the relation of device characteristics to the degree of periodic loading. Results of measurements on a sub-array of 64 phase shifters are given to illustrate the repeatability of a described simultaneous assembly technique."
"Details are given of lumped capacitors, inductors, resistors, and gyrators. Active combinations of these components and encapsulated semiconductor chips include a 4-GHz tunnel-diode amplifier, a varactor-tuned X-band Gunn oscillator, a degenerate S-band parametric amplifier and an X-band Doppler radar. It is concluded that the techniques described here are useful at microwave frequencies up to X-band."
"Using a digital computer the spectrum of a Gaussian envelope pulse can be evaluated to accuracies of better than 0.01 dB over a dynamic range of 100 dB. This technique was used to investigate the problems in existing microwave transmitters. From such a study a low-level absorption-type modulator followed by linear power amplification is a logical method. A commercially available p-i-n diode modulator was then measured on a microwave network analyzer, and, from the resulting amplitude and phase data, the spectrum was computed. The computed prediction of the spectrum was then compared to the measured spectrum and found to agree within 1 dB to -50 dB."
"The phaser is economical to fabricate and is geometrically well suited for use in phased array antennas. A 35-GHz model is described with exhibits a 2-GHz bandwidth. The model phase may be utilized either as a 360° latching device by using flux transfer switching, or can provide up to 800° of differential phase shift with holding current bias. The nominal insertion loss of the phaser is 2 dB with a VSWR <;1.3 across its bandwidth. The measured characteristics of the phaser show good agreement with computational values."
"Design techniques for high-performance microwave delay lines which have superior bandwidth, phase linearity, and spurious echo characteristics are presented. Utilization of these techniques to realize a 4-μs L-band unit which has insertion loss of 30±0.5 dB over the 500-MHz band centered at 1.7 GHz, with triple-transit suppression greater than 45 dB and phase deviation from linearity of less than ±2.5°, is described."
"The ring-loaded corrugated waveguide is shown to be very effective for frequency broadbanding of the waveguide and improvement of the transformer between the corrugated and uncorrugated waveguides."
"A novel approach to microwave phase control, utilizing liquid artificial dielectrics, is described. These media have been fabricated with permittivities which vary in magnitude and anisotropy according to the strength of an applied electric control field. Continuously controlled permittivity increases of at least 20 percent in the electric field direction are realizable in liquid suspensions having low loss and very high dielectric strength. A simple waveguide liquid dielectric phase shifter has been built at Ku band and its operating characteristics measured. This approach can be applied to the design of electrically variable microwave lenses, power dividers, and resonant cavities as well as phase shifters."

 "The study centers upon new, technologically based firms founded on the San Francisco peninsula since 1960. Spin-off rates were calculated for individual organizations and for different classes of organizations in this area. It was found that organizations varied widely in the extent to which they had served as incubators of new firms. Firms with less than 500 employees and small subsidiaries had higher spin-off rates than large firms. Nonprofit organizations served as incubators for only a small percentage of the new firms. Limited evidence suggests that, within large firms, the large divisions had the lowest spin-off rates."
"Network models with both time and cost dimensions have not been used extensively on industrial construction projects. Analysis of 33 companies participating in the study revealed that network model requirements were incompatible with information currently generated by the organization. Moreover, the organizational structure of a company was a strong determinant as to the level of model sophistication adopted. For example, companies with decentralized estimating and scheduling used bar charts and simple time-based models. Incompatibility of model inputs requirements and available data was not a problem since the source and use of such information was at the same point in the structure."
"In numerous decision analysis problems the decision maker must make estimates of various probabilities, such as the probability of completion of a project by a given time, the probability of receiving a specific order, the probability that market demand for a product will be at a certain level, etc. Only infrequently is it possible to perform an `after the fact' evaluation of the accuracy of such subjective probability estimates. This paper describes the results of a practical application where subjective probability estimates by a group of 436 qualified individuals could be compared with subsequent realizations. The reasons for the divergences that were found are analyzed and related to other problems where one must rely on subjective probability estimates. Thus, although the specific survey described here is of a specialized nature, many of the findings have general applicability."
"In this paper a nomogram is presented as a quick method for precomputing the economic range of expenditure on a project before its actual initiation. After a brief discussion of the several factors that distinguish the problem as presented to a research establishment in a developing country, the theory underlying the construction of the nomogram and its application is outlined, and the technique is evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the nomogram in a study of 15 completed R&D projects."
"The flow of information to and within an industrial bioscience research laboratory has been studied through use of questionnaires and interviews. The scope of the study and difficulties encountered are described. Sources of ideas for product and procedural innovations, reading in scientific and technical literature, and the flow of information between departments are reported and related to published reports of similar studies. The possible impact of geographic and demographic factors and the effects of the unique mix of science and technology on research organizations are discussed."

"THE FIRST paper in this issue by Stephenson et al. is a thorough study of obstacles and incentives to creativity, levels of risk-taking situations, and conflicting objective situations in organizations. The reader will find that the authors have taken care to provide references to related research and to carefully and fully describe how they obtained the information upon which they base their findings, both of which should serve to increase the reader's ability to assess the credibility of the information that is offered for his use."
"Three questionnaires were completed by 109 employees of a government R&D laboratory and 121 employees from 28 industrial R&D organizations. In one questionnaire the respondents expressed their opinions about obstacles and incentives to creativity in the organizations at which they worked; in another they indicated `actual' and `ideal' levels of risk-taking situations in their organizations; and in the third they indicated to what extent 15 statements about conflicting objective situations were characteristic of their organisations. The answers seemed to indicate that at the government laboratory there were fewer obstacles to creativity than in industry, that risks were taken oftener at the government laboratory than in industry, and that conflicting objective situations differed between the government laboratory and industry."
"This paper describes the evolution of an experimental computer-aided technology planning tool (PLANET) for integrating technology plans and evaluating potential resource allocations to mission-oriented technology programs. Factors influencing the development of this experimental planning system are discussed. Based on this experience, summary observations are presented including guidelines, evaluation criteria, and problems encountered."
"This paper discusses the organization and the criterion for funding of an applied research project that can be regarded as a collection of necessary but potentially unsuccessful tasks. Each task might be successfully achieved by any of a number of alternative approaches. Each alternative approach can be regarded as a collection of necessary but potentially unsuccessful subtasks. Each subtask consists of subalternatives, etc. A comparatively simple procedure is given for selecting which projects to fund, for estimating various expected expenditures, and for determining that order of carrying out the tasks, alternatives, subtasks, etc., of a project that minimizes the project's expected cost. The procedure takes into account the possibility that the project may fail and be abandoned before all tasks, subtasks, etc., are performed and the possibility that engineering considerations may exclude some economically desirable task orderings. A number of industrial practices are discussed from this viewpoint."
"This paper presents an analytical review of mathematical programming models that have been proposed as aids to the related problems of resource allocation and project selection in R&D. The models are classified according to whether they are based on linear, integer, or dynamic programming. Representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in detail. The evaluation is in terms of data requirements; built-in assumptions; ease of computation; usefulness of outputs; versatility of application."
"Clara E. Erickson was born in Baumholder, Germany, on March 15, 1934. She received the B.A. degree in psychology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1955. She spent the following year studying psychology on a Fullbright scholarship at the Ludwig Maximilian Universität, Munich, Germany. She then returned to the University of Michigan where she received the M.A. degree in psychology in 1957."

"THOSE whose work allows them to live in a relatively neat and orderly world — mathematical theorists, for example, or production managers, perhaps — may find it strange that R, D&E managers are constantly preoccupied with problems of uncertainty. But it is this everpresent uncertainty in the process of having to come up with a workable and usable solution to a very specific and real and immediate problem that is the central concern of R, D&E."
"This paper explores the effect of learning by determining the rate of learning that best explains the pattern of choice and outcome in 21 actual R&D projects. A fairly slow, rather than rapid rate of learning is found to be significantly associated with the pattern of choice and outcome realized in the cases that are analyzed. The methodology and implications of the results are discussed."
"A mathematical model has been developed for the purpose of assisting R&D management in their evaluation and selection responsibilities of potential R&D projects. It is composed of (1) a project evaluation module that utilizes the concept of discounted cash flow to reduce the measures of each project to a single economic index (the expected net present value) and (2) a project selection module that utilizes a linear programming algorithm with 0-1 variables to select the set of projects that maximizes the total expected net present value, while satisfying specified budget constraints. The system, having been implemented through a time-sharing computer service, is presently operational and is being used by management as a tool to assist in the R&D decision-making process."
"Sixty-nine technical entrepreneurs were studied emphasizing description of several of their characteristics such as family background, education, and motivation. The results indicate that entrepreneurial fathers are more likely to produce entrepreneurial sons. An individual's home environment and attitudes that seem to be embodied in his religious background are likely to have strong influences on his goal orientation, education, and whether or not he becomes an entrepreneur. In addition, those technical entrepreneurs whose fathers had high occupational status were educated sooner and to a higher level than those whose fathers had low occupational status. At the same time it was determined that the technical entrepreneurs who had self-employed fathers usually reached the Master of Science degree level, the median education of the entire sample. The predominance of such educational behavior for entrepreneurial sons may be explained by their goal orientation toward a level of education adequate for effectively running a technically based enterprise. Motivational influences on entrepreneurial behavior were not clearly evidenced by analysis of this sample."
"This paper summarizes the results of a questionnaire from 38 companies with separate commercial and technical divisions and whose technical divisions deal with comparatively high technology. These companies are among the larger companies in the United States. The basic purpose of the analysis is to compare the ways in which top management of these companies treats these divisions with respect to capital allocations, incentive compensation, technology transfer, and executive rotation."
"William J. Abernathy was born in Columbia, Term., on November 21, 1933. He received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1955, and the M.B.A. and the D.B.A. degrees from Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., in 1964 and 1967, respectively."

"THE FIRST paper in this issue by Baker et al. describes the differences and similarities in how top management and the research staff evaluate ideas (or proposals) for new research. Their attention was directed, particularly, to the characteristics of urgency and predictability and they present the implications for R&D management."
"The ideas produced by three idea generation groups operating within a large industrial R&D laboratory were studied over a period of two years. Data were collected in order to relate idea dispositions by management to subjective evaluations provided by respondents representing the technical staff and to study the roles of urgency, predictability, and expected time horizon in the disposition decision. The findings are 1) a significant positive correlation was found between idea dispositions and associated subjective evaluations despite the fact that management did not know the subjective evaluations at the time the disposition decisions were made; 2) urgency was the dominant consideration in the disposition decisions, but predictability and expected time horizon were dominant in the subjective evaluations; 3) predictability and time horizon are covariants; and 4) management hedges by shelving marginal ideas. Implications for R&D management are drawn."
"The process of technical innovation is treated as occurring in three phases: 1) idea generation; 2) problem solving; and 3) implementation and diffusion. Two questions are addressed in a study of the origin and development of 32 new scientific instruments: first, what information led to the origination of ideas for these new products, and second, how was information acquired and used in developing these ideas? Idea generation was assumed to require a synthesis of several pieces of information. Innovators relied on oral communications outside their firm in generating ideas. Conversely, they tended to rely on sources inside their firm and to use first local sources of information (literature and experience), then secondary sources (discussion) and finally primary sources (analysis and experiment) in problem solving."
"Flow charts and network methods are vital tools used to facilitate clear concise planning and scheduling of large projects. The limited flexibility and vocabulary of existing tools do not suit the planning and depicting of research and development (R&D) projects. DELTA charts described in this paper have been designed to incorporate not only events and activities but also decision and logic functions that enable representation of alternative approaches and feedback paths, both of which are essential in R&D project planning. A precise syntax for the DELTA chart components is defined in order to make them capable of presenting a clear precise picture that is self-explanatory to a wide audience. Two examples of DELTA charts are presented, the first of which is a DELTA chart that indicates the procedure for making a DELTA chart."
"The phasing out of products is not an uncommon occurrence in times of rapid technological change. The problem of terminating the production of complex apparatus is compounded when it involves entire families of related products. This paper describes a linear programming procedure that establishes an optimal policy of phase-out so that the final production runs will reduce the terminal inventory consistent with maximum income at an acceptable return on investment."
"This paper reviews a number of studies of the correlation between the number of citations and the article quality and concludes that citation patterns do reflect the intellectual links between publications and that number of citations does correlate with quality of work."
"This `fictional case study' describes the early stages in the assignment of an engineering manager to a major computer development program, with emphasis on his resistance to the use of the work done by others."
"The general problem of how much to spend on which alternative investment opportunity has plagued decision makers for many years. The real-world decision situation is usually confounded by the uncertainty of the information base, the indeterminateness of the organizational goals and constraint regions, and the analytical complexities of examining the pertinent trade-off combinations. The literature on the analytical structure of the capital budgeting/project selection problem has grown enormously since the early 1950's. This “structural” literature has concentrated primarily on two central aspects of the overall problem: 1) a “correct” analytical representation and 2) algorithmic solutions to various formulations. The former approaches have dealt with such problems as the “correct” discount factor (e.g., the Hirschleifer paradox) and a representative preference frontier (e.g., the Friedman-Savage models) for quantifying the decision-maker's risk aversions. The latter area of study is perhaps historically the older of the two and centers around mathematical programming techniques (e.g., the Lorie-Savage problem)."

"The Board of Directors has approved the formation of three IEEE Societies, effective January 1, 1971. Responding to the initiatives of the existing Groups in these areas, the Board approved the IEEE Power Engineering Society, the IEEE Computer Society, and the IEEE Control Systems Society. These actions are the culmination of more than three years of study and analysis by the Technical Activities Board, originally under the leadership of James H. Mulligan (now IEEE President) and, currently, Harold Chestnut, Vice President for Technical Activities. Together with the related reorganization of the Board of Directors, approved last fall, which established Divisional Directors responsible for each of the six groupings of IEEE technical activities, this move is the most significant step taken in the organization of IEEE's technical activities since the “Professional Group” concept was introduced in IRE by W. R. G. Baker more than 20 years ago."
"The use of electron and ion beams in the field of microelectronics has grown rapidly over the past ten years. For example, fine-focused electron beams, which initially were employed in diagnostic tests on integrated circuits and semiconductor devices, now are being utilized in the laboratory for creating devices and circuits with resolutions considerably higher than the values achievable by photolithography, and ion beams are being employed in the production of integrated circuits. It is seen that the beam approach offers a number of advantages compared with contemporary techniques. This article describes some of the devices that can be fabricated with electron beams, thus indicating the state of the art, discusses the advantageous features of ion implantation doping, and points out the limitations on beam processes imposed by fundamental electron/ion optical effects."
"Machines employing thyristor- and diode-assisted commutation (TAC and DAC) offer numerous advantages over conventional dc machines in applications where commutation is a problem. It is anticipated that the first practical developments will involve adaptations of present systems, followed at a later date by the introduction of more unconventional construction techniques."
"Ways for analyzing social systems result in new policies for improving the behavior of systems in which we live. Such policies can change urban slums into areas designed for self-renewal. Already, studies into the relationships between monetary policy, interest rates, and foreign exchange have thrown new light on the processes of corporate growth, product stagnation, and loss of market share, and on the growth and decline of cities. At one time the engineer's task was simply to balance financial cost against the economic performance of his technology. Now, psychological stress, ugliness, and crowding have become part of the cost. Engineers who fail to realize this broadened role will be vilified by a society that views them as insensitive to the needs of the times."
"Communications satellites have been in commercial operation for more than five years. With the growth of traffic requirements, particularly those of the developing nations, the early methods used in the Intelsat network for multiple access have had to be updated. The full potential of satellite communications can be realized by using the satellite to provide connections between any two users on demand. This article traces the development of the multiple-access techniques employed with Intelsat from the two access methods associated with Early Bird to the demand-assignment technique planned for Intelsat IV. This latter method, SPADE, is to be the first operational demand-assignment multiple-access system and is scheduled for use in 1971. Details of the SPADE system and its use for other applications are reviewed."
"The United States is finally facing up to the fact that we can no longer tolerate the uncontrolled application of technology. We are now seeing the results of what has seemed almost a national program of conspicuous consumption — depletion of our natural resources and the deterioration of our environment. Hopefully, the trend can still be reversed by planning and control. Over the years, a substantial body of literature has accrued on this vital topic, and an attempt is made here to provide the interested student with a guide."
"Especially adapted for servo systems with inductive actuators, the MCA and MCB units are a family of hybrid class-D power amplifiers. These amplifiers use switching techniques to implement the pulse-width-modulation operation. The MCA and MCB 1000 types employ a complementary output stage and planar output transistors. The circuits operate from a dual unregulated power supply (to ± 40 volts). The new MCA/MCB 2000 amplifiers with an external inhibit point (see Fig. 3) will replace the existing series."
"An engineering challenge. With one of the great “natural resources” of the United States — engineering manpower — on the way toward virtual decimation, one wonders just how long the present administration will wait before it declares a “national disaster” and comes to the aid of those who, more than anyone else, have brought the country to its present position of affluence and technological prominence."

"This document describes the basic requirements for the qualification of Class I electric equipment. This is equipment which is essential to the safe shutdown and isolation of the reactor or whose failure or damage could result in significant release of radioactive material."
"This standard applies to those parts of the electric systems in stationery single-unit and multi-unit land-based nuclear power generating stations that provide electric power to the Class IE electric equipment. The electric systems included are comprised of the following interrelated systems\" (1) alternating-current power systems, (2) direct-current power systems, (3) vital instrumentation and control power systems. These systems consist of power supplies (e.g., connections to the station switchyard, stand-by generators, batteries), distribution equipment and components (e.g, transformers, switchgear, bus cable, battery chargers, inverters), and instrumentation and controls (e.g., relays, meters, switches, control devices). This standard does not apply to the unit generator(s) and their buses, step-up and auxiliary transformers, switchyard, transmission lines and transmission network."
"A formula is derived for computing the power spectrum of multilevel digital phase-modulated signals. The results apply to arbitrary pulse shapes and probability distributions providing that the pulses do not overlap and are independent. This formula can be applied easily to compute power spectra of signals phase-modulated by various pulse shapes. Several examples are given for rectangular and raised-cosine pulses."
"Both one- and two-stage feed-forward control were applied to α 4-GHz, 461A, traveling-wave tube, used in the TD-3 radio relay system, to demonstrate the feasibility of reducing distortion to a sufficiently low level for single sideband transmission. With a single stage, and discounting extraneous losses, the third-order, MS, distortion measure was reduced by 38 dB over a selected 20-MHz channel, and the application of the second stage rendered distortion unobservable with our instruments. These results were time independent with continuous performance over several months."
"A modulation scheme in which the transmission path length of the mm-wave signal is digitally modulated by means of a PIN diode switch has been proposed for the waveguide transmission system. To demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal, a complete transmitter has been developed in the 50 ∼ 60-GHz range, consisting of an IMPATT oscillator, circulator, PIN diode switch, and its driver circuit. The model can handle signals at 300 Mb/s and deliver 100 mW of modulated power at the output. This paper describes the design considerations of each component in detail, together with the experimental results."
"This paper is concerned with a study of traffic and message delay in a ring switched data transmission system. The system, by asynchronous multiplexing and data storage, shares transmission facilities among many users. It is the random component of message delay due to buffering that is the focal point of our study. The basic configuration of the system is a ring connecting stations where traffic enters or leaves the system. A mathematical model of the ring is developed which accommodates an arbitrary number of stations and any given pattern of traffic between stations. Studied in detail is the uniform traffic pattern in which each user is identical and communicates equally to all others. Intrinsic to the model is a recognition of the bursty nature of data sources. Other factors that are taken into account are line and source rates as well as the blocking of data into fixed size packets. Formulas are derived from which average message delay induced by traffic in the ring can be calculated. The results of the study are presented in a set of curves where normalized delay due to traffic within specific system configurations is plotted as a function of the number of stations and source activity. The delay here is normalized to average message lengths. An important parameter of these curves is the ratio of source rate to line rate. The results show that, in certain quite reasonable circumstances, the delay is less than two average message lengths. Rings of 10, 50, and 100 users have been simulated on a digital computer. Data obtained from these investigations are presented and compared to the theoretical estimates for line busy and idle periods and message delay. The results of simulated average message delay show that, for inter-station link utilizations of about 60 percent, the difference between the theoretical estimates and experimental observations is small."
"An analysis of E-plane (transverse) radiation from horn reflector antennas for horizontal (transverse) polarization is presented. This analysis was based on Geometrical Theory of Diffraction with modifications to account for (i) finite edges, (ii) grazing incident wave, and (iii) aperture illumination. Once proven valid for our purposes, the analysis was extended to permit blinders to be added to the antenna. Experimental and theoretical studies of single edge blinders have shown them to move the azimuth location of undesirable high sidelobes but not substantially reduce the sidelobe level. A half blinder, however, was shown to reduce the undesired 90-degree sidelobe to — 62 dB, an 8-dB reduction. Simultaneously, sidelobe levels are below — 62 dB for azimuths between 35 degrees and 180 degrees at both 3.74 and 6.325 GHz. Theoretical predictions indicate it is broadband at 4, 6, and 11 GHz. The half blinder also has excellent mechanical features."
"This paper presents an analytical review of the transient events relating to charge, current, voltage, and energy upon disconnection of inductive loads in switching circuits. Based on good agreement between theory and experiment, the analysis is found applicable to a number of long-standing relay and switching circuit problems involving radiation interference, voltage breakdowns in various elements of the contact circuit, and contact erosion."
"The transmission medium or the radiating system often fails to maintain the orthogonality between two polarizations. Using a differential phase shifter and a differential attenuator, the orthogonality can be recovered by the transformation of two nonorthogonal elliptically polarized waves into two orthogonal polarizations."
 "In this paper we compute the change in the energy of a uniformly magnetized uniaxial platelet produced by the introduction of a cylindrical domain. Differentiation of the energy expression yields the translational force produced by gradients in plate thickness, material composition, or temperature. The force expressions provide a means for estimating the effect of gradients in these parameters on the margins of domain devices. Equating the sum of the gradient produced forces to the drag force yields a general domain velocity expression. The various results are presented in both graphical and tabular form."
"This paper applies the theory of cylindrical magnetic domains1 to cylindrical domain devices. The stability conditions are examined as bounds to the region of possible device operation and it is found that the plate thickness, h = 4l, and the domain diameter, d = 8l, where l is the ratio of the wall energy per unit area to 4π times the saturation magnetization squared, are preferred values. When the effects of wall coercivity and mobility are examined, it is found that the preferred plate thickness and domain diameter are even more strongly preferred, that the wall motion coercivity should be less than one percent of 4π times the saturation magnetization, and that a domain coercivity and mobility may be defined. Consideration of the Néel temperature and the desired absolute domain size in addition to the static stability conditions shows that domain materials having some antiferromagnetic character and induced uniaxial anisotropy are preferred. Where appropriate, domain methods for measuring material parameters are described."
"We determine the spreading resistance for a sheet of homogeneous material of uniform thickness with a disk contact source on one side and with current collected (i) over the entire back plane, and (ii) at a corresponding disk on the back plane. A constant driving potential is assumed over the source resulting in mixed boundary conditions in the plane of the source. For each case, a closed form integral solution is derived and then numerically integrated for a range of geometric ratios resulting in a universal spreading resistance curve. The results are used to evaluate the spreading resistances encountered in a typical (1 Ω cm) semiconductor material."
"In this paper we derive equations describing the performance of various adaptive echo canceller configurations operating in a linear, time-invariant environment. We relate the parameters in these equations to measurable environmental factors, discuss their effect on performance, and verify the results empirically. In general, the performance of an echo canceller cannot be exactly predicted for speech inputs. Therefore, the derived equations assume a stationary constant power random input. However, it is shown that the results obtained in this manner give useful estimates of the performance to be expected with speech inputs. The similarities and differences of the results for a constant power random input and speech input are discussed in detail."
"We present in this paper experimental and theoretical results on the number of fades, average durations of fades, and the probability distributions of fade durations for line-of-sight microwave transmission in the 6- and 4-GHz bands. Both fading of single signals and simultaneous fading of pairs of signals within each of the two bands are treated. The experimental results are based on data obtained in 1966 in Ohio. Mathematical description of the number and average duration of fades is based on a theory in which pairs of signals are treated as correlated random variables that are jointly Rayleigh distributed. The durations of deep fades of single signals tend to be lognormally distributed. A probability distribution of the duration of simultaneous fades, which agrees with experimental data, is obtained from the lognormal distribution using a heuristic model."
"In dielectric waveguides operating at optical frequencies, the primary cause of time dispersion of narrow pulses can be mode conversion. In this paper we argue that under certain assumptions a dielectric waveguide acts as a linear system in intensity. That is, given the intensity input, the intensity output is equal to the input convolved with an intensity impulse response. We show that contrary to intuition, the width of the impulse response gets narrower when coupling between guided modes increases. Using the perturbation results of D. Marcuse, we obtain an interesting model of energy propagation down imperfect guides. We conclude that the intensity response width increases as the square root of the guide length for sufficiently long guides and approaches a gaussian shape for sufficiently long guides. We conclude from the theory that the dispersion in dielectric wave-guides may be orders of magnitude below that which was previously expected in guides of sufficiently long length having properly controlled large amounts of mode conversion. These theoretical results have not yet been verified experimentally."
"L. T. Gusler and D. C. Hogg have estimated that interference coupling due to rain is a significant factor in coordinating the shared use of frequencies between satellite-communications and terrestrial microwave radio-relay systems. Their calculations are based on the assumption that rain scatters isotropically. Calculations given here, based on the exact anisotropic angular scattering functions, do not alter their conclusions. The exact scattering patterns at selected frequencies in the range 1.4 to 300 GHz for rains whose drop sizes obey the Laws-Parsons distribution are presented for the range of rain rates 1 to 150 mm/hr."
"We examine the effect of loading and filtering on adjacent channel interference noise and give the results for different cases of filtering and various amounts of bandlimiting. The results are applied to typical systems and an empirical formula relating channel spacing to loading and adjacent channel interference is derived. We give some examples computing the capacity of typical radio channels."
"We present in this paper two definitions of short-term frequency stability: (i) time domain, the expected value of the variance of the fractional frequency fluctuations from nominal frequency, <σy3(N, T, τ)=, in which N is the number of samples, T is the averaging time plus the dead time between samples, and τ is the averaging time; and (ii) frequency domain, the power spectral density of the fractional frequency departure from nominal frequency, Sy(f). We discuss the topics of conversion from the frequency domain to the time domain and conversion among time domain measures. All measurements were made in the time domain, using period counting techniques. An oscillator was offset in frequency by using a specially built quartz crystal unit plated for 10 kHz below the frequency of the other sources. This oscillator was used to obtain the beat frequency required by the period counting approach. Since the use of <σy2(2, T, τ)> as a measure of short-term stability has significant advantages over <σy2(N, T, τ)>, the relationship between the two quantities was investigated. For averaging times of one second or less, >σy2(2, T, τ)> and <σy2(N, T, τ)> were almost equal. The short-term stability of several quartz crystal oscillators and precision frequency generators was measured. The stability over the shorter averaging times was nearly equal for most of the oscillators. At longer times, the stability of each oscillator was unique. The frequency generators demonstrated similar stability over averaging times of 10 and 100 milliseconds, but were unique elsewhere. The accuracy of all measurements was limited by systematic effects from the environment and the measurement equipment itself."
"This paper considers the problem of transmitting bandlimited signals using binary signaling over a noise-free channel. An analytical framework is presented for the design and analysis of a class of PCM systems where peak error is of primary interest. For a specific class of input signals which includes deterministic amplitude-constrained bandlimited functions as well as bandlimited wide-sense stationary, second-order, random processes, results are obtained which provide trade-offs between the sampling rate, quantizer and reconstruction filter."
"Injection-locked oscillators are shown to act as narrow-band tunable filters for FM signals if the modulation rate is much larger than the locking bandwidth. The filtering action of the injection-locked oscillator for FM signals is found analogous to that of a high Q passive cavity. The effective Q of the injection-locked oscillator can be as high as 105 if the stability of the injected signal carrier and oscillator frequencies is better than 106. These filtering properties can be applied to a digital demodulator for coherent phase detection of a coded FM signal. The local source which is required for coherent phase detection is provided by using a fraction of the received signal to lock an oscillator. Sideband suppression and carrier amplification of the injected signal are achieved simultaneously by using the filtering action of the injection-locked oscillator. The simplicity of this digital demodulator makes it appear useful for repeaters in microwave radio relays."
"In this paper, we present sequential codes which have interesting properties in three respects. First, these codes may be used to achieve low redundancy (e.g., bandwidth compression through coding) by employing a multiplicity of variable-length codes to encode transitions between successive source symbols. Second, the coding complexity is surprisingly low. Third, many of these codes have exceedingly good intrinsic recoverability properties following errors. These codes compare favorably with a difference code environment in which the differences between successive source symbols are encoded. The scope of the sequential codes presented here includes, but is much wider than, difference code schemes. Where comparable, the sequential codes have slightly greater complexity and may have lower redundancy. They normally have vastly superior error recovery. These codes are applicable in situations such as video transmission in which the message source is highly correlated and where errors can be tolerated for a short period of time."
"A two-wire active asynchronous time-division switch has recently been proposed by J. O. Dimmick, T. G. Lewis, and J. F. O'Neill. The interrupted energy transfer from one filter to another is accomplished asynchronously in order that more efficient use may be made of processing time of talker pairs on the switching bus. After first formulating, in a concise mathematical fashion, the effect of passing a signal through such a randomly time-varying circuit, we focus attention on optimizing an important filter response function. Typically, two percent rms jitter in the transfer times yields αn output S/N of 30 dB independent of signal spectrum. The timing stabilization required to obtain small jitter is also discussed and an exact solution for exponential processing time is obtained. This latter result may be put to good use in studying the efficiency of the switch. Conservatively, asynchronous operation should increase traffic capacity threefold. Finally, a speech wave which passes through a sample-and-hold circuit with random sampling times is considered upon being reconstructed with a fixed filter. This is a model for a four-wire active asynchronous switch, and results are compared with the two-wire situation."
"In a previous paper a series expansion method for calculating the error probability of a binary digital AM system in the presence of intersymbol interference and additive gaussian noise was derived.1 In this paper those results are extended to the multilevel case. In the examples calculated for a four-level system, this method is 104 times faster than the exhaustive method and is 102 times more accurate than the Chernoff bound. The actual computation time with an 11-sample approximation to the real system impulse response is only 1.3 seconds with the GE Mark II time-sharing system."
"We derive an expression which can be used in a relatively straight-forward manner to obtain either the autocorrelation function or the spectral density of any “reasonable” function of any stationary gaussian process. The expression is used to study the spectral density of a sinusoidal wave which is phase modulated by a hard-limited gaussian process."
"Three classes of differential coders have been built which exploit the two-dimensional spatial correlation present in television pictures. The three classes are distinguished according to the technique used to predict the value of the picture element (pel) to be coded. In the first class, the prediction is the value of the previous element along the scan line averaged with one or more elements in the previous line (of the same field). In the second class, the prediction is the sum of the value of the previous pel with the local element difference in the previous line. In the third class, the transmitter and receiver choose the prediction from either the previous element or some combination of the previous element with the elements in the previous line. The choice is based on differences measured between elements already coded. These are available both at the transmitter and receiver, so no extra information need be transmitted. In the absence of transmission errors, the pictures resulting from all three classes of coder are markedly improved over those in which only the previous element is used as a prediction. In particular, vertical and sloping edges are now well defined. The effect of a transmission error on a single frame of the received picture is scarcely visible in the first class of coder but is much more visible in the second and third classes."
"The control of linear time-invariant systems is one of the most basic problems of modern automatic control theory. Although “optimal controllers” which minimize certain costs associated with control can be determined, in most applications “simple controllers” suffice, and are often more desirable. The criteria by which these simple controllers are designed are closely related to the problem of assigning the eigenvalues of the fundamental matrix (i.e., the poles of the system) to arbitrary but specified locations. This paper presents an approach to the design of such control systems. Our approach does not involve computing complicated canonical forms, as do some previous methods, and at the same time generalizes easily to multi-input-output systems. A simple solution of the problem of designing feedback control systems with a minimum number of dynamic elements is also presented."
 "Foremost among the problems in semiconductor switching netWork implementation is the difficulty of fabricating a semiconductor cross-point which duplicates the characteristics of of metallic crosspoint of nearly zero “on” impedance. A low crosspoint impedance is necessary for low signal loss through the switching network."
"In the theory of traffic in telephone connecting networks it is on one hand a virtual necessary, for practical purposes, to oompromise the true oomplexity of the system under study and to introduce drastic simplifying assumptions that allow some calculation to be done, and on the other, it ia perfectly feasible to pursue basic theoretical studies without such compromise and simplification. For thie reason, a spectrum of several mathematical models for describing traffic in networks has been developed in recent years."
"The methods used to perform the switching functions of the Bell System have been developed under the fundamental assumption that the holding time of the completed call is long compared to the time needed to set up the call. In considering certain forms of communication with and among computers the possibility arises that a message, with its destination at its head might thread its way through a communication network without awaiting the physical realization of a complete dedicated path before beginning on its journey. One such scheme has been proposed by J. R. Pierce and may be called “loop switching.” We imagine subscribers, perhaps best thought of as computer terminals or other data generating devices, on one-way loops. These “local” loops are connected by various switching points to one another as well as to other “regional” loops which are in turn connected to one another as well as to a “national” loop. If a message from one loop is destined for a subscriber on another loop it proceeds around the originating loop to a suitable switching point where it may choose to enter a different loop, this process continuing until the message reaches its destination. The question naturally comes up, how the message is to know which sequence of loops to follow. It would be desirable for the equipment at each junction to be able to apply a simple test to the destination addressing the loops which has several attractive features: (i) It permits an extremely simple routing strategy to be used by the messages in reaching their destmations. (ii) By using this strategy, a message will always take the shortest possible path between any two local loops in the same region. {iii) The method of addressing applies to any collection of loops, no matter hoio complex their interconnections. The addressing scheme we propose will be applied primarily to local loops where the mutual interconnections may be quite varied. If a certain amount of hierarchical structure is introduced into the regional and national loop structure, as suggested by J. R. Pierce1 it is possible to achieve addressings which are both compact and quite efficient."
"Traffic behavior in the Pierce loop for data transmission is studied under assumptions of heavy loading. A deterministic mathematical model for describing traffic flows is developed and analyzed. The mathematical problem is of a linear complementarity type which has not been dealt with in the literature of mathematical programming. An effective procedure, the load-and-shift algorithm, for determining traffic flows is proposed. The procedure yields all feasible solutions for traffic flows and reveals the possibility of stations grouping into dominating classes and preventing other stations from using the system. This property, which can be eliminated by exercising appropriate control, also may affect the stochastic behavior of the system when heavy traffic conditions do not prevail and therefore deserves careful investigation. The paper includes two numerical examples illustrating use of the load-and-shift algorithm and numerical results from a simulation showing some of the effects of dominating classes when heavy traffic conditions do not prevail."
"The bending losses of the asymmetric slab waveguide are computed. The computation is based on the knowledge of the exact form of the solution of Maxwell's equations of the bent structure and the additional assumption that the field near the bent waveguide can be approximated by the field of the straight waveguide. The result of this theory is in good agreement with an existing theory. It appears that the bending loss formula can be used to estimate the bending losses of the round optical fiber if the mode parameters entering the formula are replaced by the corresponding mode parameters of the round fiber. We present curves that allow the numerical evaluation of the bending loss of the lowest order even TE mode of the symmetric slab waveguide."
"This paper contains design criteria for the suppression of cladding modes in optical fibers by means of a lossy jacket. The calculations are actually based on the slab waveguide model. However, it is believed that the results are representative, at least to order of magnitude, for the round optical fiber. It is found that the cladding modes are absorbed most effectively if the real part of the refractive index of the lossy jacket equals the refractive index of the cladding material. However, slight deviations from this optimum design are not critical. The loss of the cladding modes depends on many parameters so that general statements as to the order of magnitude of the expected loss are hard to make. However, a loss of 1 dB/m should be easily obtainable."
"A thorough solution to the problem of determining the error rate of a digital communication system with intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise is presented in this paper. The solution achieves for the first time a combination of computational simplicity and a high degree of accuracy, and is obtained by deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the error rate. It is shown that, for a system with a normalized peak distortion less than unity, these bounds can be made to differ by an arbitrarily small amount. The numerical evaluation of the bounds takes less than one second on the GE-Mark II time-sharing system for almost all the cases. Examples are given for 2M-ary digital systems to demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method. The results show that our estimates of error rate are generally orders of magnitude better than the Chernoff bound. For example, in the case of an ideal bandlimited system [(sin t)/t pulse shape] with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16 dB and a sampling instant deviation of 0.05 from the optimum value, the lower and upper bounds on the error rate are 1.1 × 10−8 and 1.2 × 10−8, respectively. This method can also be applied to the calculation of the performance of certain phase-shift-keyed systems and certain systems with co-channel interference."
"The ratio of attenuations measured simultaneously at 18.5 and 30.9 GHz on a common 2.6-km path during 1970 in New Jersey show that, with exceptions for special cases, the Laws and Parsons drop-size distribution adequately represents the rain on terrestrial microwave communications paths. The ratio derived from cumulative distributions of attenuation is also discussed. A rain-induced attenuation of 30 dB is found to be exceeded 0.001 and 0.01 percent of the time at 18.5 and 30.9 GHz, respectively. These results are in good agreement with attenuations derived from rain rates obtained on the Holmdel rain gauge network."
"This paper describes an optical modulation scheme with a demonstrated information rate of 1 Gb/s. The modulation scheme employs an electronic multiplexing technique to obtain the high data rate from four 250-Mb/s channels. Efficient interfacing between the gas laser beam and the high-speed electronic circuits is achieved using a traveling-wave type modulator structure. General considerations in optical modulation systems are also included."
"Since theoretical and computational difficulties often preclude exact solution of telephone trunking network problems, approximate methods are naturally used. A typical approach is to determine link∗ blocking probabilities and from them calculate point-to-point blocking probabilities by invoking independence assumptions. Although the link blocking probabilities may be quite accurate, the point-to-point blocking probability calculations will, in some cases, suffer from the independence assumptions. This paper presents a method of taking dependence into account for certain networks by approximating conditional probabilities which reflect the dependence. The approximations avoid the problems of dealing with the large sums associated with this problem."
"Transmission performance of the telephone message network has improved steadily over the years. Coincidental with this improvement has been the evolution of rating plans which provide the basis for transmission planning, design, and evaluation. Loudness of telephone speech was an important consideration in this evolution. Telephone speech loudness continues to be one of the major factors which need to be taken into account in telephone transmission engineering. This paper covers a laboratory system, called EARS (Electro-Acoustic Rating System), devised to make objective measurements of partial and overall telephone connections (including electro-acoustic transducer efficiencies) in a manner which reflects subjective loudness loss. Topics covered include a historical review of rating plans, computation of speech loudness, evolution of the EARS, and description of the system and its capabilities. The EARS essentially comprises a sound source and a meter for measuring either acoustical pressure or electrical voltage. Design of the source and meter are based on telephone speech loudness considerations, and measurements made with the system approximate subjective loudness judgments with an accuracy which is sufficient for telephone engineering purposes. The EARS may be used in implementing any telephone transmission rating plan incorporating speech loudness loss as an element. In such application, the system can be used for specifying connection losses, thus eliminating the need for extensive subjective tests of loudness. However, subjective tests will still be required to evaluate effects of other elements, e.g., noise, important in any given plan, and to evaluate the range of loudness losses acceptable for that plan."
"A systemwide survey of the performance of Bell System toll connecting trunks was undertaken in 1966. Various results of this survey have been used in other studies since that time. This paper collects the main results in a single writing. The sampling plan and measurement procedures are discussed briefly. Measurement results are presented in distributional form and as estimates for the transmission parameters relating to loss, message circuit noise, impulse noise, relative envelope delay, P/AR, harmonic distortion, and physical characteristics. Some results are presented separately for major facilities and facility categories."
"In this paper we calculate a lower bound on suppression provided by an adaptive echo canceller in either a nonlinear or time variant environment. Specifically, we examine the effects on performance of nonlinear echo paths described by a Volterra integral equation [equation (18)] or time variant echo paths caused by phase jitter on single-sideband suppressed carrier systems."
"In this paper we apply the Volterra representation of nonlinear systems to the echo control problem and propose a generalized adaptive echo canceller which compensates for nonlinear echo paths. We prove that the proposed echo canceller converges and reduces the echo to zero and finally we suggest other applications for the system."
"Data are presented and compared with current traffic loss theory in three trunking areas: high-usage groups; full (nonalternate routed) groups; and final groups. Both single hour and average busy season busy hour load-loss comparisons are made. Methods of estimating offered loads from carried loads, and from the proportion of calls blocked, are considered. The blocking which results from offering nonrandom traffic to overflow groups is discussed. Modifications in the theory commonly applied are indicated in each case when necessary to obtain satisfactory agreement with observed values."
"The paper presents results on the stability and dynamic behavior under large signal conditions of networks consisting of transistors and sources connected to a linear, passive, memoryless subnetwork. The transistors' model incorporates various nonlinearities. A characteristic common to the main results of the paper is that they relate to properties of the transistors alone and, hence, are independent of the passive part of the network. Sufficient conditions are obtained for asymptotic and bounded input-bounded output stability. The conditions impose restrictions on some of the physical constants of the transistors' model. These conditions have an interesting physical interpretation in terms of temperature differentials in the transistor junctions. In particular, any transistor with the exponential type of static diode characteristic is passive only if the ratio of the junction temperatures lies inside an interval determined by the α's. In the state space of the network there exists a well-defined region R specified by the transistors' model with the property that constant terminal states in R are independent of initial conditions. The region R is in a certain sense maximal."
"This paper gives an algorithm from which an approximation to the amplitude of a quadrature pair can be obtained simply and without requiring more bits than are needed to represent the largest allowable amplitude, A. If A cos θ and A sin θ are a quadrature pair, the amplitude is $A=(A^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta + A^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta)^{1\\over 2}.$ If AX is the larger magnitude of the pair and AY the smaller, an approximation to A is $A^{\\prime} = AX + {1\\over 2}AY.$ Computations using this algorithm with random values of θ showed that when the true amplitude was A, the mean obtained was 1.087A, with standard deviation 0.031A. When A consists of a signal appreciably contaminated with noise so that several estimates are required before the signal can be detected reliably, no significant degradation («0.1 dB S/N) in detectability was found using the algorithm described above."
 "It is known that frequency feedback demodulators can show instability in their response to step changes (mistuning) in input frequency. This work reports on some mathematical analyses of this phenomenon as described by differential equations arising from simple IF and feedback filters in the demodulator. These equations are studied for local and global stability by geometric or phase-plane analysis, by means of Lyapunov functions, and by the topological Poincaré-Bendixson methods. A typical result is for the case of no feedback filter and one-pole baseband analog of the IF filter, and states in physical terms that if the mistuning is not too big, specifically if |mistuning| < (half-power IF bandwidth)(1 + feedback gain) then solutions which are bounded away from zero amplitude approach the natural equilibrium point. Examples are given in which a sufficiently large mistuning makes the equilibrium point unstable."
"Some computer experiments in processing still pictures for bandwidth reduction are described. In the scheme studied, a picture is partitioned into subpictures each of which is encoded separately. A subpicture is expressed as a linear combination of a finite set of specially chosen basis subpictures. Quantized versions of the coefficients of this expansion are transmitted as binary digits. Using this procedure, we were able to obtain pictures of good quality using approximately 2 bits per picture-element; we were unable to do so at lower bit-rates. Some general comments on the encoding of pictures are included."
"Speech signals can be described in terms of the resonances of the vocal tract. These resonances, or formants, change at rates comparable to the motions of the vocal tract. They therefore can be sampled and quantized to low bit-rates, and hence constitute an economical form for digital storage of speech information. Formant coding also permits flexible arrangement of speech elements into various contexts. This report describes a computer technique for synthesizing continuous messages by concatenating formant data for word-length utterances. The stored data for the synthesis corresponds to a bit-rate of 533 b/s. A Honeywell DDP-516 computer is used to experimentally evaluate a voice response system. In an initial application, the system is used to synthesize 7-digit telephone numbers. To assess the synthesis an interactive dialing experiment, also conducted by the computer, is described. The results show the synthesized numbers to be comparable in communicative effectiveness to naturally spoken digits."
"This research concerns the judged pleasantness of a variety of electronic calling signals. Five experiments are reported in which type and frequency of carrier; type, frequency, and waveform of modulation; and spectral composition were varied. The results have aided in the selection of two signals for further trials."
"An algorithm is developed to control a class of rearrangeable switching networks, particularly with the base-2 structure. Various methods of implementing this algorithm are also described. System organization and processing time for rearranging the network are studied and are shown to be practical."
"The decomposition of permutations as used in the control algorithm for a class of rearrangeable switching networks is proved. Enumeration studies on permutations related to the network are presented. Theorems for constructing a set of traffic patterns for diagnostic purposes are also given. Finally, a procedure for detecting and locating faulty switching elements in the network is described."
"For telephone circuits which include synchronous satellites, conventional echo suppressors of the voice-switching type are less than satisfactory because of speech mutilation and the presence of echo during double talking.1 We have found that a multiband center-clipping process may be used as an echo suppressor. This echo suppressor is unique in that no double-talking decision has to be made. The near-end signal, plus echo of the far-end signal, is divided into several contiguous bands with each filter output going to a center clipper. A control circuit sets each clipping level equal to or greater than the echo level in that band. A preliminary analogue implementation of this echo suppressor, in which control circuit gains were manually adjusted to match the experimental return loss, was informally demonstrated using a simulated satellite circuit. Although no attempt at quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out and further evaluation is necessary, no echo was reported during this demonstration, even during double talking, for return losses approaching 0 dB. Operation appeared to be full-duplex at all times with little distortion of the speech. For return losses greater than about 15 dB, the center-clipping system was almost indistinguishable from a 4-wire connection with no echo path. In practice, adaptive setting of control circuit gains as a function of return loss would be desirable if this technique is used as a replacement for conventional echo suppressors."
"Recent studies of the heat loss characteristics of the normal modes in dielectric lined circular waveguide have shown that modes other than those of the circular electric type may have low loss over wide frequency bands. This unexpected behavior of the mode loss characteristics is explained by utilizing the well-known duality relationships between the electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, it is shown that the lowest loss modes are alternately circular electric and circular magnetic as frequency (or lining thickness) increases, with low loss occurring at frequencies and lining thickness where the wall impedance of the dielectric coated guide approximates a short circuit (or electric wall) for circular electric modes, and an open circuit (or magnetic wall) for circular magnetic modes. These findings will influence and aid in the selection and design of an appropriate waveguide(s) (employing the circular electric TE01 mode) for the WTS millimeter wave transmission system which is presently under development; they may also influence the design of future guided wave systems."
"Recent studies have shown that modes not of the circular electric type have low-loss characteristics in dielectric lined circular waveguide. It was determined that circular electric modes are low-loss for linings approximately 0, λ/2, λ, · · · wavelengths thick while circular magnetic modes are low-loss for λ/4, 3λ/4, · · · thick linings. In this paper we derive a simple relationship between the loss characteristics of circular electric waves with 0, λ/2, · · · thick linings and circular magnetic waves with λ/4, 3λ/4, · · · thick linings. Specifically, we show that the minimum obtainable circular magnetic mode loss is at least four times greater than the minimum obtainable circular electric mode loss. We also show that the minimum loss for successively higher order circular electric (magnetic) modes corresponding to approximately 0, λ/2, · · · (λ/4, 3λ/4, · · ·) thick linings is approximately the same if we neglect the dielectric losses."
"It is shown how various timing recovery schemes are reasonable approximations of the maximum likelihood strategy for estimating an unknown timing parameter in additive white gaussian noise. These schemes derive an appropriate error signal from the received data which is then used in a closed-loop system to change the timing phase of a voltage-controlled oscillator. The technique of stochastic approximation is utilized to cast the synchronization problem as a regression problem and to develop an estimation algorithm which rapidly converges to the desired sampling time. This estimate does not depend upon knowledge of the system impulse response, is independent of the noise distribution, is computed in real time, and can be synthesized as a feedback structure. As is characteristic of stochastic approximation algorithms, the current estimate is the sum of the previous estimate and a time-varying weighted approximation of the estimation error. The error is approximated by sampling the derivative of the received signal, and the mean-square error of the resulting estimate is minimized by optimizing the choice of the gain sequence. If the receiver is provided with an ideal reference (or if the data error rate is small) it is shown that both the bias and the jitter (mean-square error) of the estimator approach zero as the number of iterations becomes large. The rate of convergence of the algorithm is derived and examples are provided which indicate that reliable synchronization information can be quickly acquired."
"The minimum mean-square error (M.M.S.E.) at the receiver output generally depends upon the sampling instant and demodulating carrier phase for synchronous data systems. In this study, it is shown that for certain single-sideband data systems with no excess bandwidth (e.g., class IV and class V partial-response systems), the M.M.S.E. is completely independent of the sampling instant and demodulating carrier phase if the receiver contains an infinitely long transversal filter equalizer. Practically speaking, computer calculations indicate that for a class IV system operating in the presence of typical received signal-to-noise ratios, a 19-tap equalizer is sufficient to make the M.M.S.E. relatively insensitive to the sampling instant and demodulating carrier phase. Thus, for such data systems, a significant reduction in the receiver complexity and possibly in the start-up time may be obtained, because no time is spent acquiring timing and carrier phase. The optimum infinite-length equalizer for synchronous data systems with a fixed channel is also calculated for two different conditions. The conditions are: (i) the minimization of the output noise plus mean-square intersymbol interference and (ii) the minimization of the output noise subject to the constraint that the equalizer forces the intersymbol interference to zero. Explicit expressions for the optimum equalizer and the M.M.S.E. are obtained. Satisfying condition (i) results in the lower value of M.M.S.E.; however, the M.M.S.E.s for these two criteria are almost equivalent for either large signal-to-noise ratios or small slope of the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the channel."
  "Previous results on the statistics of avalanche detectors are generalized to the case where electrons and holes suffer collision ionizations with unequal probability. It is assumed here that the ratio of collision ionization probabilities per unit length of weaker-to-stronger carrier is a constant k independent of position in the high-field region. The moment-generating function of the random avalanche gain G is obtained as a function of k and the average gain G, and is used to obtain Chernov bounds on error rates of digital optical receivers employing avalanche detectors. It is shown the required energy per pulse to achieve a given error rate decreases as k decreases for fixed G. For each k > 0, there is an optimal mean gain Gopt resulting in minimum required energy per pulse. At k = 0.1 Gopt ≈ 100 and the required energy is within 10 dB of that required with very high gains (a few thousand) at k = 0."
"A bank of bandpass filters is often used in performing short-time spectrum analysis of speech signals. This paper is concerned with the analysis and design of digital filter banks composed of equally spaced bandpass filters. It is shown that significant improvement in the composite filter bank response can be achieved by proper choice of the relative phases of the bandpass filters. The results are extended to more general filter bank configurations."
"A preference study was made to assess the relative annoyance values of slope-overload distortion and granular noise in delta-modulated speech. A recently described adaptive delta modulator was simulated at frequencies of 20 and 40 kHz, and controlled amounts of the two types of degradation were introduced into samples of a 2-second utterance. Rankings were obtained for these samples on the basis of preference judgments of nine listeners, each of whom assessed the samples, pairwise, in a tournament-type strategy. Results indicate that the speech sample exhibiting the minimum degradation on an objective, overall-noise-power basis is not subjectively the most preferred sample. Furthermore, the subjectively optimum delta modulator exhibits greater overload and lesser granularity than the objectively optimum device."
"Simple upper and lower bounds on the distribution function of the sum of two random variables are presented in terms of the marginal distribution functions of the variables. These bounds are then used to obtain upper and lower bounds to the error probability of a coherent digital system in the presence of intersymbol interference and additive gaussian noise. The bounds are expressed in terms of the error probability obtained with a finite pulse train, and the bounds to the marginal distribution function of the residual pulse train. Since the difference between the upper and lower bounds can be shown to be a monotonically decreasing function of the number of pulses in the finite pulse train, the bounds can be used to compute the error probability of the system with arbitrarily small error. Also when the system performance is evaluated by simulation techniques, the methods presented in our paper can be utilized to estimate the error caused by using a finite pulse train approximation."
"This paper describes a method of thermally fusing clad glass fibers, end to end, to obtain a good mechanical joint with low transmission loss. Methods of preparing fiber ends and aligning them for joining are discussed. Two sizes of fibers were joined (10.8-μm core and 20-μm core clad fibers with outside diameters of 75 μm and 150 μm respectively).∗"
"If fibers are to be coupled together by means of detachable connectors, there is a need to know how much light will be lost by misalignment or axial separation of the fiber ends. Measurements were made of coupling efficiency from one fiber to another versus offset and end separation with and without index-matching liquid between the ends for a single-mode and a multimode fiber at λ = 0.6328 μm. Graphs are presented for offsets as great as 3 radii and for end separations up to 127 μm. Maximum coupling efficiency of 97 percent was obtained, and about 50 percent was obtained with an offset of 1 radius."
"When a charge-coupled device is made with a single layer of metallization, adjacent electrodes must be placed several micrometers apart. As a result there may be some difficulty in moving the charge from one electrode to another. In this paper it will be shown that, for any substrate material, there is a wide range of interface charge for which complete transfer can be achieved regardless of electrode separation. It will further be shown that for a p-substrate with a doping of less than 1016/cm3, the natural charge found in a good quality thermally grown layer of SiO2 is always of the appropriate sign and magnitude to ensure complete transfer. Therefore, for simple fabrication of a CCD with one layer of metal, this substrate material is the appropriate choice."
"Rate changing is encountered in data transmission, distributing, collating, encoding, and decoding. It entails the transformation of data at one rate to data at another predefined rate. It is the object of this paper to investigate a special class of circuits that accomplish such a transformation quite mechanically and methodically when only one clock is available to propagate all the binary bits of information. These circuits can be implemented by magnetic domains, by charge transfer and charge-coupled devices, or by any other technology which permits (i) propagation of binary bits of information by a certain modular “period” or “distance” in a modular unit of time and (ii) gating of preselected bits of information from one branch into one or the other branches of three branch nodes in a circuit. The generalization of rate-changing circuits to distributing, collating, reversing, and reversing-with-rate-changing is also presented in the paper."
"An infinite trunk group split into a finite first-choice group and an overflow group is studied. The equilibrium distribution, at an arbitrary instant, of the number of busy trunks in the overflow is obtained for the case of Poisson input and constant holding time. Some numerical comparisons of variances and distributions for exponential and constant holding time are given. The variance of the overflow was found to be always the greater for constant holding time, and in the case of one trunk in the first-choice group this inequality is proven to be true analytically. In same cases studied, the variances differ markedly — by as much as 50 percent. Implications of these results for the traffic engineering of overflow groups with nonexponential holding time are discussed."
"A general analysis of the statistical behavior of the envelope of a fading signal V (t)eiϕ(t) is presented in this paper. The statistics include the probability P(V ≤ L) that the amplitude V (t) will fade below a specified signal level L; the expected number N(L) of fades of V (t) below L per unit time; and the average duration &tbar;(L) of fades below L. The model for the fading signal is a constant vector plus a random interfering vector which represents the resultant of all the received extraneous signals and noise. The theoretical results agree with three empirically observed power relationships obtained in deep fades of nondiversity signals: P(V ≤ L) ∝ L2, N(L) ∝ L and &tbar;(L) ∝ L. The theoretical results are applicable to a wide class of fading problems. The analysis includes the previous works of Rice, Nakagami, Norton, Vogler, Mansfield, and Short as special cases."
 "The papers in this series describe the status of a continuing program at Bell Telephone Laboratories to apply computers to all phases of transmission circuit design. The process involves the same steps now that it has historically. Given a set of circuit objectives, the designer:"
"Analysis of the variation in the electrical performance of integrated circuit structures requires a knowledge of the distributions and inter-relationships of device parameter values. This article presents new techniques for more accurate transistor modeling and describes the statistical characterization procedure developed to describe the integrated circuit manufacturing process as far as the measurable electrical parameters are concerned."
"The design of linear circuits requires the designer to consider element tolerances, distributions and correlations and how they interact with proposed manufacturing test limits and service conditions such as temperature and aging. Analytical methods can be used in a limited number of cases; simulation methods using large modern computers permit study of more complex design problems. The principal themes of this paper are the designer's needs for computational assistance and the ways in which computer programs may be organized to meet these needs. Two computer programs for this purpose are described. One is a general-purpose analysis program for large networks having any topology. The other is a more specialized program suitable for “biquad” networks which may be used as building blocks to form a variety of filter and equalizer networks."
"Despite recent advances in the speed of digital computers and in numerical algorithms for the solution of differential equations, the evaluation of the dynamic response of nonlinear circuits is still too slow to permit Monte Carlo tolerance analysis. However, the performance of many nonlinear circuits can be evaluated on a static basis. One example is a D/A converter built with devices much faster than the converter's cycle time. Algorithms now exist that produce the static or equilibrium solution of such networks in seconds. This paper deals with these algorithms and the associated techniques that have been embodied in a program for the Monte Carlo tolerance analysis of nonlinear, “dc,” circuits."
"The ability to evaluate the performance of linear network elements used in complex systems is vital to effective optimization and verification of the system design. Measuring systems controlled by digital computers provide a new capability for linking the steps of network design, breadboard development and characterization, and factory test in such a way that the networks produced will more nearly meet the requirements of the systems in which they are used. This linkage is effected by incorporating in the measuring system the algorithms relating the measured quantities to the system performance parameters used during the design stage. Output of the system performance parameters in real time provides a powerful aid for debugging development models and a more valid basis for accepting or rejecting product in factory tests. Statistical analysis is used as an aid in setting test limits by evaluating the relationships between component tolerances, measurement errors and the calculated system performance parameter."
"A Monte Carlo study is an analysis in the sense that for specified tolerances, correlations, etc., empiric distributions of measures of performance are obtained. An approach is presented which addresses itself to the inverse problem, that of determining the tolerances, correlations, etc., necessary to realize acceptable performance distributions. The approach is based on the concept of large change sensitivities which are proposed as a measure of sensitivity for statistical design. The approach specifically addresses design problems such as specifying tolerances, desensitizing a nominal design, recognizing the possibilities for and specifying tuning and/or matching procedures, and verifying that a design is consistent with expected statistical correlation between parameters. We present an example illustrating several of these applications."
"The prediction of manufacturing yield of an electric circuit, given the tolerances and statistics of the components, is a straightforward procedure using Monte Carlo tolerance analysis. The inverse problem, namely, specifying the component tolerances that produce the cheapest network, is more difficult and has received little attention in the literature. In this paper an algorithm is presented that solves this problem for a significant class of networks. The algorithm is limited to circuits for which one hundred percent yield is sought and whose components are statistically independent, i.e., discrete circuits. The one hundred percent yield assumption is used to reduce the number of possible tolerance choices. A variation of the branch and bound strategy that is shown to be particularly efficient is then used to make an optimum selection. Two-dimensional performance contours, worst-case, and Monte Carlo computations are also used as part of the procedure. An example circuit is demonstrated for which the algorithm produced a tolerance assignment substantially cheaper than that projected by the designer."
"Computer simulation makes it economically feasible to analyze competing circuit configurations and optimize the circuit parameters using complicated criteria related to system performance. Furthermore, the influence of manufacturing tolerances on optimized performance can be statistically investigated to establish component specifications before production is started. Thus, the designer can predict more easily whether or not a circuit will perform adequately in the field. In addition, computer operated test sets can provide accurate measurements of circuit performance during manufacture to insure that the product will be satisfactory. These test facilities can be programmed to provide a factory evaluation of the individual circuits based on worst-case system performance. To illustrate these concepts, it is shown how computer aids were utilized in the design of the pulse equalizers for the T2 digital transmission line. The discussion of the equalizer design is intended to illustrate why and in what manner the various functions were implemented. The statistical tolerance analysis and manufacturing test phases receive the greatest emphasis as they are the most recent developments."
"Monte Carlo tolerance analysis has proven to be an effective tool in evaluating the sensitivity of a circuit design to manufacturing tolerances and environmental changes. Such an analysis involves repetitively “constructing” samples of the design in the computer, randomly selecting parameters that obey the manufacturing statistics; “tuning” the samples; and analyzing their operation under “field conditions.” At the conclusion of this process one is able to form empirical distributions of circuit performance, to predict yield, evaluate tuning procedures, etc. This paper describes a Monte Carlo study of two proposed designs for an integrated, single-substrate, RC, Touch-Tone® oscillator. Difficulties arise in perfoming this study because (i) the statistics of integrated circuit components are closely correlated, and (ii) the inherent nonlinearity of oscillators coupled with tight circuit performance specifications require tailored analysis techniques. The study shows one of the two designs to be superior. A lower bound of 55 percent yield is predicted for this design, and a simple test for eliminating oscillators that fail to meet requirements is presented. Low transistor current gain is shown to be a dominant cause of failure. Lastly, asymmetry in the effects of impairments on circuit performance suggest a modification in adjustment strategy."
"Monte Carlo techniques have proven to be useful in examining the effects of component variations in electronic circuits. These techniques can also be applied to the study of parameter variation in systems. As an example of this approach, this paper reports on the use of Monte Carlo techniques in the study of impairments in the waveguide transmission system, a high-capacity, long-haul communication facility now under development at Bell Laboratories. Two examples of the Monte Carlo analysis are discussed. These examples show how the Monte Carlo analysis can give the system designer insight into the effects of impairments on the system performance, and can aid the designer in setting requirements on the system components. It is expected that these techniques will find further application in other Bell System design efforts."
"To characterize the transmission performance of the Bell System switched telecommunications network, Bell Telephone Laboratories conducted a survey of toll connections during 1969 and 1970. Connections were established between Bell System end offices chosen by statistical sampling techniques. Both analog and data transmission tests were performed. A summary of analog transmission performance is presented in this paper. It contains estimates for noise, loss, attenuation distortion, envelope delay distortion, peak-to-average ratio, frequency offset, level tracking, nonlinear distortion, and phase jitter for toll calls within the Bell System. Accompanying papers discuss data transmission error performance at various speeds between 150 and 4800 bits per second."
"In this article we present estimates of data transmission error performance at data rates of 1200, 2000, 3600 and 4800 b/s on the Bell System Switched Telecommunications Network. The source data was collected as part of the 1969–70 Connection Survey conducted by Bell Laboratories. Results are based on measurements made on approximately 600 toll connections, dialed from 12 receiving to 92 transmitting sites in the United States and Canada. Standard Bell System Data-Phone® data sets were used to transmit and receive the digital signals. Distributions of errors per call are given on a bit, burst and block basis. Information is also presented on the distribution of intervals between errors, the structure of error bursts, and the number of errors in blocks of various sizes. Some discussion is given on error causes observed for operation at 2000 b/s. Results of error rate measurements indicate that for operation at 1200 and 2000 b/s approximately 82 percent of the calls have error rates of 1 error in 105 bits or better, assuming an equal number of short-, medium-, and long-haul calls. This represents a substantial improvement of performance in comparison with results of previous surveys. For each of the four data rates tested, 1000-bit block error rates of less than one block error for every 102 data blocks transmitted are achieved on 80 percent of the calls. For operation at 2000 b/s, a major cause of errors is shown to be impulse noise."
"Error statistics of low-speed, start-stop data transmission over the Bell System switched telecommunications network are reported in this article. During the 1969–70 Toll Connection Survey, measurements were made on 534 connections with over 21 million characters transmitted, to give an overall average character error rate of 1.46 × 10−4, Over 90 percent of the low-speed test calls contained about 36,000 or 54,000 characters. A character error rate of 10−4 or less is indicated for 77.6 percent of all calls, while 95.0 percent of calls have a lost character rate of 10−4 or less. Error-free performance is shown for 48.3 percent of all calls, and 89.3 percent have no lost characters. Statistics of bursts, error-free intervals, block errors, and carrier failure durations are also presented."
"Power transfer between two ellipsoidal reflector antennas with common focal points and dual-mode feeds has been investigated. Assuming a circularly symmetric feed pattern, the H-plane pattern of an open-end circular waveguide excited by the TE11 mode, the maximum transmission coefficient between reflector apertures is found to be within 0.5 percent of the value computed for transmission between two circular apertures with optimum illumination described by the generalized prolate spheroidal function. Transmission loss between two reflector antennas versus illumination taper is computed for various values of the parameter [p = (ka1a2)/R]. The minimum transmission loss is obtained as a compromise between feed spill-over and aperture transmission efficiency. In view of the inconvenience of building different ellipsoidal reflectors for different antenna spacings in order to achieve maximum power transfer, we examine the feasibility of using a defocused ellipsoid to simulate ellipsoids of different focal lengths. The deviation of the aperture phase distribution of a defocused ellipsoid from a required spherical phase front is approximately given by an explicit expression. A simple upper bound of the transmission loss due to small phase deviation is obtained for a given maximum phase deviation."
"A fixed-step-size delta modulator followed by digital circuits for generating an adaptive delta modulation signal provides an attractive compromise between code efficiency and cost. In order to control the total quantizing noise, the fixed-step-size delta modulation sampling rate is higher than the adaptive delta modulation output rate. Computer simulations, based on the adaptive delta modulation technique described by N. S. Jayant, indicate that the sampling rate required for negligible degradation relative to a conventional adaptive delta modulator is well within the current state of the art. Our approach lends itself to any scheme of step-size variation and may use any means of single-integration, fixed-step-size delta modulation."
"This paper provides an overview of work on statistical formulations and analyses associated with the problem of identifying persons on the basis of spectral energy representations of acoustical utterances. The investigation has been largely empirical and the paper focuses on the statistical techniques and strategies that have been developed in the context of analyzing two sizeable bodies of data. The problems and procedures to be discussed include: (i) data condensation and representation; (ii) efficient and practical criteria for classification and discrimination; and (iii) strategies for automatic identification of talkers in relatively large populations."
"A general outage formula relating a number of important system outage factors has been derived for long-haul radio relay systems utilizing in-band or crossband automatic channel switching. This formula is used to estimate the outage of TD and TH systems with various switching strategies. The results indicate that the crossband 2 × 18 protection-to-working channel switching system appears to be a very attractive arrangement from the standpoints of good system reliability and efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum."
"Consider an observed process that is the sum of a Wiener noise process and the integral of a not necessarily gaussian signal process. The innovations process is defined as the difference between the observed process and the integral of the causal minimum-mean-square-error estimate of the signal process. Then if the integral of the expected value of the absolute magnitude of the signal process is finite, we show that the innovations process is also a Wiener process. The present conditions are a substantial weakening of those previously used in which the integral of the signal variance had to be finite. The new result is obtained by using some recent results in martingale theory. These results also enable us to obtain similar results when the Wiener process is replaced by a square-integrable martingale."
 "This paper considers the computational capabilities of different mathematical models of magnetic bubble interactions. A specific model was studied earlier by R. L. Graham, who showed that there exist combinational functions of 11 or more variables that cannot be computed by this model. This paper extends his results by introducing different types of interactions which seem to be practical and enable the computation of all combinational functions. The problem of efficient computation from the points of view of time and space requirements and the geometrical requirements imposed by the fact that interactions can occur only between physically adjacent locations are also examined. Finally, a model in which computations are carried out by applying uniform magnetic fields to the entire platelet, with individual access limited to locations along the periphery, is presented."
"In those charge-coupled devices (CCD's) which have regions under each electrode which are substantially free of externally applied tangential electric fields, charge motion takes place by space charge assisted diffusion, and this relatively slow process represents a limitation to the operating frequency of CCD's with large plates. In this paper, subject to certain approximations, the equations of motion for CCD charge transfer have been derived, yielding a nonlinear diffusion equation. The solution of this equation by a stable finite difference scheme is described, and the solutions are applied to predicting the operating characteristics of CCD's. The results in synopsis are: (i) The n-channel devices will have lower losses at a given frequency than the p-channel devices, and a higher upper frequency limit. (ii) Higher amplitude signals (more charge) yield lower losses. (iii) Losses can be reduced an order of magnitude by using zero's which carry a substantial amount of charge. For example, with 2-MHz clocking of a 25-μm plate (pad), p-channel 2-phase device, a 2-volt one is diminished by 4 percent per transfer with empty zero's, but with 1-volt zero's, the diminution is 0.26 percent per transfer. (iv) Reasonably efficient CCD operation should be possible up to the 50-MHz range using contemporary design tolerances. (v) Diffusion is important for reaching high transfer efficiencies. The frequency limitations described in this paper can be overcome by using a structure in which the distance between the electrodes and transferring charge is comparable to the electrode width and spacing."
"A small-signal (linearized) theory of discrete-charge-transfer-device performance is presented for the case of incomplete charge transfer. Specifically, the dispersion relation is derived which relates the charge-transfer efficiencies presently characterizing these discrete (in space and time) devices to the usual measures of device or transmission-line performance based on the attenuation, dispersion, phase velocity, etc., of sine waves. In a more general sense this emphasizes the applicability of conventional signal theory to these new devices. The impulse solution or Green's function is then shourn to be the equivalent of a bivariate distribution in probability theory. More generally the utility of (deterministically interpreted) probability theory is emphasized by showing the equivalence of a general small-signal theory to a random-walk process."
"A theoretical and experimental description of laser machining of thin metallic films is given. Calculations are carried out for the temperature rise of a thin film in response to a pulse of incident light energy and for the dependence of the temperature rise on the different thermal constants of the substrate and film and on the illumination conditions. Experiments have been conducted on the pulsed machining of thin bismuth films with glass and mylar as substrates using a lowest-order transverse mode argon laser with an average power output capability of 20 milliwatts. A fast intracavity acoustooptical modulation system produced optical pulses with durations controllable from 25 ns to several ms. The pulse repetition rate could be varied from a single pulse up to several MHz. The peak power depended on the duty cycle but was limited to 2 watts for low duty cycles. Experiments were done with both front and back illumination. (In back illumination the laser beam is incident on the film through the substrate.) For optimal machining conditions in which the optical beam diameter is adjusted to produce the maximum diameter of transparent area for a given pulse energy, less than 50 percent of the removed material left the surface of the substrate. The remainder was displaced so as to leave some areas free of bismuth while the thickness of bismuth in other areas was increased. With a pulse duration of 25 ns and a 600-Å-thick bismuth film on mylar, the peak power required to machine a 6-µm-diameter spot was about 0.7 watt. Variable amplitude light pulses produced by the intracavity modulation system with a 1-MHz repetition rate and duration of 25 ns were used to write images on a 600-Å-thick bismuth film, deposited on a mylar substrate, by deflecting the laser beam in raster fashion over the surface of the bismuth film. The average laser power output was 20 mW. The film area was 8 × 10 mm2. Both positive and negative continuous-tone images were recorded. The images consisted of an array of 1200 by 2000 completely independent spots of varying diameter and a spot density of 4 × 106/cm2. Images of documents which were originally of size 8½ × 11 inches showed a limiting resolution of over 175 lines per inch when magnified to the original size."
"Two parallel dielectric waveguides can exchange energy if the field carried by one guide reaches the other guide. We consider only the case of coupling between degenerate modes of dielectric waveguides (optical fibers, etc). Degenerate modes have equal phase velocities, but their transverse field distributions need not be identical. The coupling theory presented in this paper applies to dielectric waveguides of arbitrary shape and arbitrary distribution of refractive index. The dielectric media of the guides as well as the surrounding medium are allowed to be lossy. The coupling coefficient is obtained by means of perturbation theory. It is shown that whereas lossless degenerate modes can exchange their power completely, lossy modes tend to equalize their power. The theory is applied to the problem of crosstalk between cladded dielectric slab waveguides and cladded optical fibers embedded in a lossy medium. Since a lossy surrounding medium also causes an increase in the loss of the guided modes, formulas for this additional loss are presented. It is shown that additional mode loss results even for a lossless surrounding medium if n3k > β. (n3 = index of surrounding medium, k = free space propagation constant, β = propagation constant of guided mode.)"
"Light scattered in one optical fiber can be scattered back into a guided mode in a neighboring optical fiber. This type of scattering crosstalk is investigated in this paper for slab waveguides. However, the results for the slab waveguide case are upper limits on the crosstalk between round optical fibers. Scattering crosstalk is expressed in terms of guided mode radiation loss whose cause is the same scattering mechanism. It is thus not necessary to know the details of the scattering mechanism as long as the scattering loss, which is a measurable quantity, is known. In addition to the total radiation loss the crosstalk depends on the width of the radiation lobe in which the scattered energy escapes from the waveguide. The crosstalk is inversely proportional to the width of the radiation lobe and thus is larger when the radiation lobe is narrow. Scattering crosstalk can become serious if both guides have a systematic sinusoidal imperfection of the same mechanical frequency resulting in a radiation lobe of nearly zero width. In the absence of a systematic sinusoidal imperfection it can be concluded that scattering crosstalk between dielectric waveguides (optical fibers) is negligible if the radiation losses are tolerable. In this case it appears unnecessary to suppress crosstalk by means of a lossy medium between the waveguides."
"Computer simulations of high-capacity mobile radio systems using different channel assignment philosophies are described. These simulations initiate call attempts and move vehicles about randomly according to prescribed statistical distributions. Base stations and radio channels are assigned to serve mobiles and system operating statistics are accumulated. Relationships between systems parameters obtained from the simulation are presented. Performance of a dynamic channel assignment system (DYNSYS) which has all channels available at all base stations is compared with performance of a fixed-channel assignment system (FIXSYS) which reserves channel subsets for use at specific base stations. For uniform spatial distributions of call attempts and 40-channel systems with reuse intervals of four base station radio coverage areas, the DYNSYS outperforms the FIXSYS at blocking rates up to 13 percent. For example, at a 3 percent blocking rate the DYNSYS provides 20 percent more calls “on” in the system."
"The minimum required antenna spacing between two base-station antennas in order to take advantage of spatial diversity technique was investigated. The measurements were made for two cases: (i) the incoming radio signal was perpendicular to the axis of two base-station antennas (the broadside case), and (ii) the signal was in-line with the axis of two base-station antennas (the in-line case). The correlation of signals received from two separated antennas at the base station was found to be much higher for the in-line case than for the broadside case with any given antenna spacing. For correlation up to 0.7, from which most of the advantage of two-branch diversity can still be obtained, we found the minimum required antenna spacing is around 70λ–80λ for the in-line case and 15λ–20λ for the broadside case. In order to achieve a correlation always less than 0.7 between two base-station signals regardless of the arrival direction of the incoming signal, a triangular configuration with a three-antenna array used with a three-branch diversity receiver is proposed, requiring less antenna spacing in the array than for a two-antenna setup."
"The technique of exchanging resolution according to the amount of movement in a picture has been previously described; in stationary parts of the picture the temporal resolution is reduced while in moving parts of the picture the spatial resolution is reduced. Here, we describe a method of applying resolution exchange to a differentially quantized (DPCM) signal. The resulting channel capacity required for the subjectively satisfactory transmission of the differential signal is halved. The coder is simpler than most interframe coders and should not increase the sensitivity of the system to channel errors."
"A number of redundancy reduction techniques are used in a coder that is about eight times more efficient than simple PCM. The coder is capable of transmitting Picturephone® signals at an average rate of one bit per picture-element (2 Megabits per second). When there is movement in the scene, most transmission time is devoted to the parts of the picture that change significantly. The data are generated irregularly but the data flow is smoothed prior to transmission in a buffer that holds about one frame of data. The redundancy reduction techniques used and the behavior of the coder are discussed both from an intuitive and from a statistical viewpoint. The positions of elements that change are signaled by addressing the first element of a run of changes and marking the end of the run with a special code word. The changes of luminance are transmitted as frame-to-frame differences using variable-length code words. When rapid motion makes the buffer more than a quarter full, only differences for every second element are transmitted, the values of the intervening changed elements being set equal to the average of their neighbors. If the buffer continues to fill, the threshold that determines which changes are significant is raised from 4/256 to 7/256 of the maximum signal value. When violent motion causes the buffer to fill completely, replenishment is stopped for about one frame while the buffer empties. Subsampling and raising the threshold are not objectionable because viewers rarely detect the small impairments introduced in moving images. Observers are critical, however, of small impairments in stationary scenes. Thus, to maintain high quality in stationary areas, the entire picture is forcibly updated every three seconds by transmitting 8-bit luminance values for three lines of every frame. A record of the coder's behaviour is available as a 16-milimeter movie film."
"Low-pass and band-pass microstrip filters up to 30 GHz have been built on silica substrates by photolithographic reduction of optimized low-frequency models. Scaling accuracies of 1.8 percent or better have been achieved. An insertion loss of 0.28 dB has been measured for a five-section low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5.7 GHz. The insertion loss of a 12-percent band-pass filter at 8.18 GHz is 0.16 dB. Good agreement between measured and calculated losses has been obtained. Circuit dimensions are given to facilitate scaling of the low-pass and band-pass microstrip filters to other frequencies."
"Frequency multipliers which are built on a dielectric substrate have many useful applications in radio systems. The multiplier circuits which include input and output filters, idler circuits, and matching networks can be produced by integrated circuit processing techniques. Varactor diodes, also made by batch processing, can be bonded to the metallized substrate. A hybrid integrated three-times frequency multiplier from 10 to 30 GHz has been designed and built on a silica substrate by using frequency scaling and integrated circuit processing techniques. The multiplier produces a CW output power of 50 mW for a pump power of 178 mW with an overall efficiency of 29 percent. The maximum output power is 150 mW. Other harmonic generators with different output frequencies can be built by scaling the existing circuit."
"An analytical study of phase contrast imaging is performed. It is shown that the complex disturbance in the image plane can be represented as a convolution of the object disturbance and the Fourier transform of the transmission function of the phase plate. The simple theory of the phase contrast microscope is then derived as a limiting case of this more general result that is applicable when the size of the phase object is small compared to the area of the entrance aperture of the system. The response of a general system to several simple large phase objects is also examined, and it is shown that qualitative information about these objects can be obtained from the intensity pattern when the phase perturbations are small, providing the background is sufficiently uniform, and the size of the phase spot on the phase plate is carefully chosen. The study provides insight into the type of performance that can be achieved, for example, if phase contrast imaging is used to extract phase information from an optical memory or if it is used as an experimental tool to study the qualitative behavior of such phenomena as clear air turbulence."
"The use of transversal filters for automatic equalization has made possible high-speed data communication over voiceband telephone channels. Recently much attention has been focused on the possible use of the high-speed data sets in private line multiparty polling systems. However, for such applications, it is necessary to reduce the start-up time of the present automatic equalizer drastically. This paper examines the start-up time (settling time) of the transversal filter equalizer for two important classes of data communication systems: Class IV partial-response systems and single-sideband Nyquist systems. (The latter represents the limiting case of vestigial-sideband systems with small roll-off bandwidth.) It is shown that in single-sideband Nyquist systems the input signals to the gain controls of the transversal equalizer may be nearly orthonormal. Consequently the equalizers may have a short settling time. It is also shown that the equalizer settling time is much longer in Class IV partial-response systems, because such systems use controlled intersymbol interference and the input signals to the gain controls are highly correlated. The possibility of reducing the settling time of the automatic equalizers is examined. A new equalizer structure is developed based on the following principles: (i) Equalizer settling time can be minimized by making the input signals to the gain controls orthonormal, and (ii) Such a minimization does not change the noise power, the mean-square equalization error, the convexity of the gain control adjustment, and the feedback control loops in the equalizer. These principles are general in that they apply regardless of the type of modulation — single-, vestigial-, or double-sideband (SSB, VSB, or DSB) — or the signaling scheme (Nyquist or partial-response). Application of these principles to Class IV partial-response systems is considered. For private line systems and systems where amplitude distortions in the communication channels are not severe (delay distortions can be arbitrary), the new equalizer can be implemented by simply adding a prefixed weighting matrix to the conventional transversal equalizer. Analysis and computer simulation show that the use of such a new equalizer can residt in a significant reduction in the system's start-up time."
"The Equivalent Random method is used for engineering many of the telephone overflow-networks in the Bell System. But since this method is not directly applicable to the analysis of graded-multiple trunk-groups which carry overflow traffic, we extend the method to cover such arrangements. The key to this extension is a technique for taking correlation into account when combining dependent streams of traffic which are themselves more variable than Poisson. In principle, the technique is applicable wherever a stream of overflow traffic is divided, submitted to independent trunk groups, and then recombined. The extended Equivalent Random method provides adequate estimates of load-service relations for graded multiples which carry overflow traffic, provided the grading capacity is not substantially influenced by the network that precedes the grading."
"Experimental data on the duration of individual fades in a 4-GHz radio signal are used to derive the rates of change in amplitude and phase of a signal propagated through a 30-mile multipath medium. A by-product is a relation between the rate of change in phase and the effective vertical velocity of the atmospheric irregularities that can be considered to be the cause of the multipath phenomena. The derived distribution of velocities is then used to predict the variations in fade duration over a wide range of frequency and path length."
"A method is presented for calculating the probability of error for a digital signal contaminated by intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise. The method constructs a close approximation to the probability density function of the intersymbol interference, circumventing the heretofore formidable computational problems by decomposing the calculation into a sequence of simple calculations. This method is applicable to binary transmissions, as well as 4-, 8-, 16-, … level transmission. The method is rapid enough for use on time-sharing facilities. As part of the method, a new and rather simple scheme is presented for including the effects of partial response source coding. Several interesting examples which use and give insight into the method are included."
 "This paper describes a new method for measuring the duration of mode-locked picosecond laser pulses. It is similar to the Two Photon Fluorescence and Second Harmonic Generation methods in that it measures not the pulse duration directly but rather an autocorrelation function of the signal. It has the advantage in that it can be used for very low-power repetitive light signals."
"Loss measurements have been made on glass fibers immersed in index matching oil. The measurements include state of polarization analyses of the light leaving fiber ends. The character of the beam was determined by using α λ/4 plate in conjunction with a polaroid analyser to measure the components of unpolarized and polarized light. The data indicates that unclad fibers attenuate light much more than similar glass clad fiber waveguides. Mode purity within a multimode glass fiber was estimated from measurements of the admixture of modes leaving its end. Light guided along unclad fibers was considerably less distorted than light propagating along similar clad waveguides."
"We discuss in this paper the excitation of dielectric waveguides used for integrated optical circuitry. Thin optical films are usually excited by means of coupling prisms using frustrated total internal reflection. We propose instead excitation of thin-film waveguides directly by gaussian laser beams. Harmful effects of imperfect substrate edges can be avoided by letting the dielectric waveguide end inside of the substrate. The exciting laser beam is directed towards the end of the guide from the inside of the substrate material. The analysis is based on neglecting reflection at the end of the thin-film waveguide and on assuming that the thin film is infinitely extended in one dimension. The maximum excitation efficiency predicted with this model is 97 percent. It is expected that the excitation efficiency of more realistic guides for integrated optics can be as high as 90 percent."
"The performance with respect to rain outage time of dual path diversity and non-path diversity (tandem) arrangements for 18-GHz short hop radio systems is computed and compared. The analysis is based on two extrapolations of R. A. Semplak's1 three-year average of the measured probability distributions for rain attenuation at 18.5 GHz on a 6.4-km hop in New Jersey. The effects of merge hops and joint fading between hops in the diversity system, dependence of the rain attenuation distribution on hop length, and uncertainty in the tail of the distribution are included. The results show that (i) the performance of tandem systems relative to diversity systems increases as the system length increases, (ii) the difference in the number of repeaters per unit length required for short and long tandem systems is small, (iii) the performance of the diversity system is strongly dependent on the amount of joint fading between parallel paths, and (iv) the performance of the tandem system is strongly dependent on the tail of the attenuation distribution. Neither of the latter two factors is known from rain attenuation measurements, but if the joint attenuation probabilities are sufficiently high, then diversity shows no advantage over tandem for either of the assumed extrapolations. The uncertainty in the tail of the attenuation distribution and the sensitivity of the tandem system performance to it emphasize the need for reliable attenuation measurements out to a probability of about 10−7."
"A statistical model is suggested for the computation of interference into terrestrial radio-relay systems from geostationary satellites. The model is general. It incorporates radio-relay characteristics, satellite arrangements, and allowable satellite power flux densities. A program simulator can be used to calculate the satellite power flux density corresponding to a particular radio-relay interference objective. Interference distributions are computed for AT&t and CCIR radio-relay models using the power flux density that was suggested for study at the 1969 CCIR Interim Meeting at Geneva, Switzerland."
"Measurements of 90-GHz attenuation through the total atmosphere due to absorption by clouds, fog and rain are presented and compared with simultaneous measurements at 16 GHz. It is seen that rain is the most important contributor to atmospheric extinction at 90 GHz, light rain causing greater then 25-dB attenuation on a number of occasions during the measurement period."
"The present study sought to determine the effects of echo-free transmission delays of 600 ms and 1200 ms on conversational behavior when subjects were unaware that delay was present. Sixteen pairs of male subjects conversed 10 minutes each over an echo-free telephone circuit with zero delay and 10 minutes each with 600 ms round-trip delay; a second group of 16 pairs conversed 10 minutes each on zero delay and 1200 ms round-trip delay. Subjects noticed nothing unusual about the circuit, but the delay caused a statistically significant increase in frequency of confusions and in amount of both double talking (simultaneous speech from both speakers) and mutual silence. Analysis by means of an on-off pattern generating model revealed that subjects seem to make some adjustments in their speaking behavior; they tend to wait longer for responses and keep talking longer when interrupted. The two delay values of 600 ms and 1200 ms produced virtually identical effects in the measures made here. All of the subjects in the study were inexperienced with delay circuits; this experiment does not address itself to the possibility that experienced subjects might react differently to the delay. Further work will investigate the effects of training subjects to notice delay."
"Questions have been raised over the years regarding the validity of the traffic-engineering tables used by the Bell System and others for the graded-multiple trunk groups within the step-by-step switching system. The tables indicate that the capacity of a graded multiple is increased when it is imbedded in the step-by-step system, the increase becoming larger as the number of switches connected to the graded multiple decreases. The increase in capacity supposedly occurs because of a “finite-source effect.” In this paper, we investigate in detail the flow of traffic through the step-by-step system to determine the validity of the tables. By a combination of simulation and analysis, we show that the increase in capacity arises not from a finite-source effect but from an inherent load-balancing that results from the clever manner in which the switches and trunks are interconnected. We conclude that, when used for engineering in the presence of day-to-day variations, the tables are adequate when the gradings are used with the large selector groups. For the minimum number of selectors, the tables estimate fairly accurately the capacity of the larger gradings, slightly overestimate the capacity for the medium-sized gradings, and overestimate the capacity of some of the smaller gradings by about 20 percent."
"In this paper, we derive statistics of the random gain of two types of avalanche diode optical detectors. A simple optical binary receiver which could employ these devices is analyzed. In particular, we determine the moment generating function of the random gain probability density for a diode with equal hole and electron collision probabilities and for a diode with unilateral gain. For the unilateral gain case, we invert the moment generating function to obtain the probability density which turns out to be a shifted Bose Einstein density. Using the Chernoff bound, we analyze the performance of a simple binary receiver using the above devices. In addition, we exactly analyze a receiver with a deterministic gain device. We upper bound the degradation incurred from the use of a random gain rather than a deterministic gain. For the devices above, the degradation can be as small as a dB or less in certain ranges of parameter values discussed in the text."
"We describe in this paper a television system in which only a fraction of the picture elements is sampled. A movement detecting circuit examines the frame-to-frame difference signals and divides the picture into “moving” and “stationary” areas. In stationary areas the unsampled elements retain their value from the previous frame; in moving areas the unsampled elements take interpolated values from the current frame. When one-half of the elements is sampled, the resulting pictures are difficult to distinguish from the original, fully sampled, picture. When the fraction is only one quarter, the degradation is visible and disturbing. We mention several possible improvements."
"V. E. Beneš considered a class of multi-stage switching networks1 and proved that if the linkage pattern between two stages is chosen in a specific way, then the resulting networks are rearrangeable. We offer a simpler proof by pointing out the relation between Beneš class networks and the Slepian-Duguid Theorem on three-stage Clos networks."
 "Optical heterodyning and homodyning (heterodyning to hueband) have been studied by varioul authors.1-3 The intermediate frequency or baaeband aignal that ia obtained by ideal optical heterodyning or bomodyning coneieta of the signal that would be expected from classical analysis plus an added puuian quantum noise. The variance of thia quantum noise is twice as large in the heterodyning case as it is in the homodyning case. Since classically beterodyning need not have a noise disadvantage over homodyning, this result at first eeem puzzling. We shall show below that the disadvantage of heterodyning can be interpreted as an unavoidable “image band” quantum noise. We shall argue this both heuristically and formally uaing quantum field theory."
 "The first public demonatration of two-way video telephony took place on April 9, 1930, when representatives of the Prell were shown a system operating between the Bell Telephone Laboratories building at 463 West Street and A.T.&T. Co. headquarters at 195 Broadway in New York City.∗ Dr. Herbert E. Ives, then Director of Electro-Optic Research for Bell Laboratories, said of this event, “The Latest development to be demonstrated that of two-way television as an adjunct to the telephone.”1 The following day a New York City newspaper reported:"
"A Picturephone® network will take maximum advantage of existing telephone equipment. To provide service, a new videotelephone set will be added to a Touch-Tone® telephone installation. Video access lines (loops) to the serving central office will be provided using additional regular wire pairs, appropriately equalized. Arrangements are being provided for extending PBX and key telephone customer switching arrangements to have a Picturephone capability. Central office switching will be accomplished by auxiliary video switches under the control of ordinary switching machines. Short-haul trunks will be provided on ordinary trunk cables equipped with equalizers as for loops. Long-haul trunks will make use of existing and planned systems, with additional equipment needed only at the terminals. The network was designed primarily for face-to-face communications, but two additional services are being offered at the outset: data communications at 460.8 kb/s and interfacing arrangements for access to a customer's computer. Other new services are in the offing."
"We describe in this paper the fundamental requirements of a visual telephone service. These lead to a basic physical configuration of the station equipment. The picture standards are chosen to provide the visual adjunct at no greater cost than is necessary to secure most of the possible enhancement of direct conversation. Transmission standards are established with the objective of limiting to an acceptable range the difference in quality between the image as viewed at the originating station and as received over the longest connection possible in the network."
"This article describes the station set designed for use in commercial Picturephone® service. Coded the 2C Video Telephone Station, it consists of three new pieces of apparatus–the 1A Display Unit, the 1A Service Unit and the 72A Control Unit. We discuss details of the electrical and physical design."
"The development of the Picturephone® station set required the special design of many new electronic components. These include new camera and display tubes for opto-electro conversion, 18 integrated circuits using both silicon and tantalum technologies, and several additional discrete devices. This article reviews the development of these custom designed electronic components."
"An important step in preparing for a nationwide, switched, video telepho7ie service is the formulation of a transmission plan for the video and audio portion of the network. The transmission plan described in this paper features digital transmission for the long-haul portion of the network and analog transmission for the local portion, close to the customer. The performance of each of the components of the network, that is, station equipment, local loops, trunks and switches, is discussed for the network as it is expected to be configured initially and as it might evolve through the 1970s."
"Local Picturephone® service will be provided using present telephone cable facilities. Three cable pairs are required for each Picturephone call, one for audio and two for video transmission. Underground cables will be used extensively and aerial facilities to a limited extent. A cable equaliser will provide shaped gain to compensate for cable loss from 5 Hz to 1 MHz. This article discusses the plan for providing baseband video transmission on paired cable facilities, the cable equalizer design features, the important rules for engineering the video transmission system, and the maintenance features."
"Crosstalk is an important consideration in the transmission of analog baseband Picturephone® signals on paired cable. Crosstalk due to the worst disturbing Picturephone signal can cause a distinctive visible interference pattern. Crosstalk interference from other Picturephone and wide-band systems, such as T1 and T2 digital lines, contributes to random noise. In addition, feedback via crosstalk coupling may cause spurious oscillation of cable equalizers. Methods are determined to control these impairments by placing restrictions on equalizer spacing and cable pair assignment."
"We describe in this paper the theory and implementation of a differential pulse code modulation system that is employed in the Picturephone® network. Established and original coding techniques have been combined to allow transmission of a coded one-megahertz analog signal over a 6.312-megabit-per-second digital channel."
"A terminal for transmitting digital signals over TD-2 microwave radio relay routes has been designed and evaluated in a recent field trial. This paper details some of the radio system characteristics which influenced the design, describes the major features of the terminal, and reports the trial results. The terminal will be used in the toll network to provide intercity Picturephone® trunks and data circuits."
"We describe in this paper a system currently under development that will adapt the L-4, and later the L-5, coaxial system for digital transmission in mastergroup bands. The terminal equipment will combine two 6.312 Mb/s digital signals and, hence, two Picturephone® signals in digital form for transmission on the coaxial systems along with analog message channels in other mastergroups. The overall system includes regenerative repeaters at intervals of not more than 300 miles to realize the error rate objective of 2.6 × 10−7, or better, for distances up to 4000 miles."
"This paper develops the switching plan for Picturephone® service from a statement of the service operating procedures. The signaling plan is presented in detail. The switching plan provides the framework for the detailed switching papers which follow."
"Central office switching of Picturephone calls required the design of an automated network capable of switching large numbers of wideband signais on an analog basis. We describe in this paper the development of a switching plan that allows for the interconnection of many customers to many trunks and at the same time stays within acceptable transmission limits. We also give an explanation of the transmission constraints on the physical design of the central office network."
"Many customers for Picturephone® service will likely be business and industrial enterprises, having PBX, centrez, or key telephone service. This paper discusses switching systems for business customers, and describes how Picturephone service will be added as a natural extension of telephone service. This paper also serves as an introduction to the detailed papers which describe each of the customer switching system Picturephone arrangements."
"Initially, Picturephone service will consist to a large extent of key telephone systems (KTS) that will permit subscribers to have multiline access to Picturephone Central Office or Private Branch Exchange (PBX) lines as well as to Picturephone intercoms. Add-on-conference capability will also be available. In this paper, Picturephone KTS operation, logic and control, and physical characteristics are described."
"In this paper we describe the system organization, operation, and apparatus of the 850A PBX, a Picturephone Smtching System. The objectives of the 850A PBX in the Bell System Picturephone service plan and the design approach taken are discussed."
"This paper describes the methods and equipment used in providing Picturephone® capability to the No. 101 Electronic Switching System. Included are a discussion of the objectives, design approach, transmission requirements, traffic capacity, and operation of the wideband switch unit (WSU) which provides the video transmission path. Also described are the video trunk circuits, junctor circuits, and the physical characteristics of the WSU."
"The addition of Picturephone® service to the communications services offered by telephone operating companies requires that additional maintenance tasks be performed by the plant forces. The Picturephone plan provides the structure for integrating the new video telephone maintenance functions with existing telephone maintenance functions. Maximum use of built-in testing features in the switching machine and the inclusion of transmission testing facilities that are a logical extension of telephone testing arrangements provide economical and comprehensive tools for accomplishing the complex tasks of installation, circuit acceptance and trouble isolation. The flexibility of the plan permits the assimilation of advanced techniques into the field as well as prompt appraisal of field experience. The plan is described in terms of its major segments, i.e., maintenance for switching, lines and trunks. The interaction of the maintenance hardware arrangements with the Picturephone plant is outlined together with an overview of the work locations and examples of tasks to be accomplished."
"New line and trunk maintenance arrangements have been developed for Picturephone® service. A switched method of accessing lines and trunks by means of the No. 5 crossbar system has been developed. In addition a new local test desk (LTD No. 15) and testboard (TB No. 23) have been made available. In this article we discuss these arrangements which represent another application of the switched access concept as an integral part of line and trunk maintenance arrangements."
 "The ability to use a Picturephone® station set to display computer generated information will be provided as an additional feature of Picturephone service. The basic element in providing computer-access service is the display data set, which acts as the interface between the computer and the Picturephone station, converting Touch-Tone® multifrequency signals from the Picturephone station into digital characters for the computer and converting the computer output into a video signal for the station. The operation of the display data set and the influence of the Picturephone network characteristics on its design are described in this article."
 "This paper gives a general description of the TH-3 long-haul microwave radio system which operates in the 6 GHz common carrier band. Performance objectives are expressed, and the allocation of noise to the various contributors is developed. Particular attention is given to the balance between intermodulation noise and tertiary interference. In conclusion, the predicted performance is compared with measurements made on the initial installation."
"The features and performance of a 6-GHz transmitter and receiver are described in this paper. The system objectives of 41 dBrnc0 for 4000 miles at 1800-circuit loading derived in the previous paper are applied to the design. With the exception of the 10-watt traveling-wave tube, the equipment is all solid state."
"This paper describes the filters and networks which provide the frequency selectivity required in the TH-3 microwave transmitter and receiver, and the equalizers, which compensate amplitude and delay distortions introduced by the filters."
"In a TH-3 repeater the required frequency downconversion, upconversion, and shift is performed by three similar solid state modulators. The choice of an unbalanced design resulted in a simple modulator microwave structure which can be easily tuned and uniformly reproduced. The shift and transmitter modulators use a varactor diode for high pump efficiency while, in the receiver modulator, a Schottky diode is used to achieve a low noise figure and broadband operation."
"Microwave integrated circuits have been employed in the Bell System for the first time in the TH-3 radio system. These circuits, using strip transmission lines, provide numerous functions previously achieved with assemblies of individual waveguide components. By utilizing the modern technologies of photolithography, precision die casting, ceramic processing, and tantalum-gold thin films, these circuits provide advantages in size, fabrication, bay “layout,” performance, and cost."
"The IF main amplifier is the output amplifier for the TH-3 microwave radio receiver. The amplifier provides a 3- to 49-dB gain range under control of an associated AGC circuit to compensate for radio signal fading. It was designed to operate with a carrier frequency of 70 MHz with extremely flat"
"The TH-3 microwave generator supplies beat oscillator power for the modulators in the TH-3 radio receiver and transmitter. The design described in this paper provides a reliable low-noise source of microwave power at 6 GHz. Design considerations and performance data are presented."
"The TH-3 radio system employs all solid state components with one exception. Because of the need for output power not obtainable presently from solid state devices, the sole exception is the traveling-wave tube power amplifier. This amplifier furnishes 40.5 dBm output power at 33.5 dB gain over any channel of the 5.925- to 6.425-GHz common carrier band. This tube employs a long-life cathode made of zirconium-additive nickel.∗ Also, it gives higher power output than traveling-wave tubes previously designed2 for Bell System radio relay systems. This new tube and periodic permanent magnet circuit are packaged as an integral unit. It does not require focusing or other mechanical adjustments during the life of the tube."
"This paper describes TH-3 powering arrangements, particularly the traveling-wave tube dc-to-dc converter."
"FM terminals form an important subsystem of long-haul microwave radio systems as the link between the baseband signal and the 70-MHz FM signal. Designed primarily for use on the TH-3 system, 4A FM terminals are also compatible with the TD-2 and TD-3 long-haul microwave radio systems. Using solid state circuitry throughout, emphasis was placed on reliability and performance consistent with TH-3 objectives with up to sixteen FM terminal pairs in tandem in 4000 miles. The FM transmitter utilizes the capacitance of two voltage-controlled varactor diodes in a resonant circuit of an oscillator operating at an IF frequency of 70 MHz. The diode capacitance is varied by applying a baseband signal across the diodes resulting in a frequency-modulated 70-MHz signal. The FM receiver uses a balanced, parallel resonant type discriminator preceded by two limiter circuits which ensure good AM suppression and a wide dynamic range. The FM terminal pair gain is 16 dB with a balanced baseband input and output impedance of 124 ohms."
"The medium-haul application of TH-3 was developed to provide an economically attractive system of moderate length and cross section without seriously compromising performance. To achieve high-quality transmission the radio transmitter-receiver bays and FM terminals common to the long-haul plant were used. Supporting equipment was both designed and adapted specifically for the medium-haul application in order to keep overall costs to a minimum."
"This paper describes a means of economically adding up to fifty VF circuits to a microwave radio system in addition to the regular payload signal. One feature of this system is its ability to add or extract information at IF repeaters without either bringing the payload signal to baseband or adding additional circuitry in the payload path."
"This paper describes the 300A and the auxiliary channel protection switching systems which provide continuity of service on TH-3 medium-haul radio systems. Both protection switching systems operate on a one-by-one frequency diversity basis. The 300A is a baseband-to-baseband system and protects the message circuit load. The auxiliary channel switching system protects the order-wire and alarm circuits and operates at both IF and baseband frequencies. System design considerations and circuits of special interest, including solid state switches and integrated circuit modules, are discussed in some detail."
"This paper points out the salient equipment and building considerations peculiar to the TH-3 radio system with emphasis on the ability to combine TH-3 with existing radio systems."
"In this paper we are concerned with the Holsinger–Gallager model for the continuous-time Gaussian channel. Gallager1 proved a coding theorem for this channel, and Cordaro and Wagner2 showed that the theorem remains valid when the effect of intersymbol interference from previous channel uses is taken into account. We show here that the Cordaro–Wagner result holds under somewhat weaker hypotheses. Further, the proof here is more elementary, since it does not depend on reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. Finally we pose what we feel is an important open problem concerning the stability of the model."
"One of the most important prerequisites for defining the spectrum of a nonstationary process is that the spectrum should transform simply and reasonably when the process is transformed linearly, and should lead to information about the important response statistics. Presented in this paper are some useful transform relationships for linear causal systems in terms of C. H. Page's time-varying spectra. Expressions suitable for direct analysis or numerical computation of the time-history of the response process and its bounds, the response power spectrum, the total energy of the system, and the upper bounds on the response shock spectra are given."
"Transmission over line-of-sight microwave radio paths is analyzed with the aid of a piece-wise linear approximation of the atmospheric index of refraction. The simple model is adequate; it predicts published experimental results. A short path is defined on which no deep fading can occur and the maximum length of such a path is estimated from measured data for New Jersey. Expressions are presented for the worst-case amplitude-frequency response and for the maximum echo delay for short paths. It is shown that if the normal Fresnel-zone clearance is maintained on short paths, no fading will occur due to substandard conditions of propagation. W. T. Barnett's result is also predicted from this model: the distribution of attenuation on long paths is a function of L3/λ where L is the path length and λ is the free space wavelength. The distribution of deep fades on long paths is predicted by this model to have the same slope as the Rayleigh distribution, the slope normally found in measurements of attenuation distributions on long paths."
"This paper presents theoretical analysis and experimental verification of the performance of a digital data modem which uses combined amplitude and phase modulation (AM–PM). The theoretical model assumes operation over the bandlimited additive Gaussian channel. The receiver used in the experiment, and for which theoretical results are presented, uses an envelope detector in parallel with a phase detector to recover the data. The criteria of error rate and communication efficiency (measured in bits per cycle of bandwidth) as functions of average signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are used to make comparisons with other modulation schemes. The theory predicts a performance from 1 to 4 dB poorer than what can be realized from single sideband (SSB) modulation. We present experimental results which indicate excellent agreement with the theory."
"A transmission model of outside plant wire pair cable systems is given. The model includes direct crosstalk within cable units and has been adapted for computer manipulation in the form of a voice-frequency simulation program. The program can simulate the terminal behavior of any coterminous system composed of a cascade of mixed gauges of pulp and PIC cables, load coils, and bridged taps. There is evidence that the simulation capability can provide useful estimates of direct, within unit, FEXT at least up to the high kilohertz frequency region. Factory data on capacitance unbalance are the essential data source for the crosstalk portion of the simulation program. For many systems studies a nominally specified cable should be represented stochastically. In this development a Brownian motion process is used to model the stochastic behavior of the capacitance unbalance. The diffusion constants for the various pair-to-pair combinations of capacitance unbalance can be expressed in terms of cable geometry. The development of this expression using capacitance unbalance data forms a basis for selecting pair twist lengths."
"This paper is concerned with mutual sychronization — a scheme for synchronizing a nationwide network of clocks for an integrated digital transmission and switching communications system. Described is an approach to the problem of determining values for the design parameters of a one-sided, linear phase averaging scheme with no filters. Two different sets of performance objectives are considered. The primary results concern the bounds which the effects of delay change force on the parameters which describe the inherent clock stability. Specifically, if a performance objective is no slips, and a limit is imposed on the amount of buffer storage, then an upper bound is forced on the allowable random drift in the free-running frequencies of the clocks. Alternatively, if an objective is that the slip rate not exceed some specified rate, again with a limited buffer size, then an upper bound is forced on the rate of random drift. Both bounds depend on the network configuration with the so called “dumbbell” configuration representing the worst case. A numerical example is included."
"This paper presents a combinatorial analysis of a mathematical model of the Main Distributing Frame (MDF). Results are found concerning the amount of additional spare needed to convert a randomly connected MDF to a preferentially assigned mode of operation. The analysis is first performed for an MDF having two sections and serving one class of service. The results are subsequently extended to an MDF with multiple sections and several classes of service."

"Avionics equipment that utilize electrical power typically convert this power by means of a converter internal to the equipment into several voltage levels. These voltages are regulated and used to power the electronic circuits within the equipment. Considering the number of electronics equipments required on the shuttle, the question arises as to whether the power converter normally supplied in each electronics equipment could be combined into a central power converter. A power distribution system would then distribute the various voltages to each load as required."
"Higher efficiency and reliability are needed in the rectification used to produce low output voltages. To this end, the application of driven synchronous rectifier circuits is investigated. One reliability problem of such circuits, the \"double-on\" resulting from storage time, is illustrated for low output voltages obtained from rectification of the square-wave outputs of low input voltage converters. A comparison of the rectification efficiency and reliability of driven transistor synchronous rectifiers with that of barrier diodes indicates that the choice of rectifiers in low output voltage applications is dependent on both the source and output voltage levels of the application."
"Satellite power system designers have known for several years that charging methods need to be improved to increase life and reduce weight of nickel-cadmium batteries. Although considerable work has been done on battery designs and charging methods to improve performance, in present long-life systems only about 25-percent of the battery energy can be used during a satellite orbit. The Chrysler Corporation Space Division (CCSD) has evolved two improved charging methods that will improve life and/or energy capability per orbit. These benefits result from limiting cell state-of-charge to less than 100-percent, and from cell electrolyte quantity increase made possible by limiting the charge level. This paper describes the state-of-the-art and pertinent prior work on batteries and charging methods, concepts evolved by CCSD that will provide improved performance, benefits to be derived from the improved methods, systems required for implementation of the methods, and the development and test program planned by CCSD."
"The successful integration of a light-weight, high-efficiency power conditioning (PC) unit with an electron bombardment ion thruster using a hollow cathode at JPL has been reported recently. This paper summarizes the presently conceived requirements by which the next generation of PCs should be judged and evaluated. The requirements are formulated in terms of a deep space mission, which implies that the characteristics of the solar source will vary in terms of output power and output voltage. The requirements identified by practical experience during long-term evaluation between 1968-1970 are described and explained."
"The Army's requirements for new concepts in land mobile power converter systems includes electrical power conversion equipment suitable for propulsion and precision power. However, cost effective power conversion by electrical means is dependent upon the availability of reliably performing thyristor switching devices. Some of the thyristor performance criteria are switching speed, blocking voltage and hard pulse current sustaining capability at high repetition rates. These qualities seemed to be combined in the \"Regenerative Gate Turn-On Thyristor,\" thus warranting a full evaluation concerning the performance characteristics of the device. This paper discusses general thyristor design problems and subsequent improvements in the state-of-the-art device performance by applying the principle of the \"Regenerative Gate Trigger\" to thyristor design (1,2). Extensive testing of a 470 ARMS, experimental regenerative-gate triggered thyristor shows that this device is potentially suited for a 1 Megawatt high speed energy transfer at elevated temperatures and is capable of blocking up to 2000 volts. The experimentally obtained and calculated data demonstrate that the device has maintained an unusually hard current, pulse switching capability despite its high frequency characteristics and interdigitation, formerly reserved only for the diffused alloy constructions. The device is of such rugged design that its actual switching capabilities and limits could not be established at the time because of basic limitations in available thyristor test equipment. The current interest in high speed thyristor switches, and the need to obtain performance data from these devices, has resulted in a government funded development program and in independent industrial design of a new generation of test equipment. Two thyristor testers are described in order to demonstrate that modern test equipment is available leading to a new generation of thyristor specifications in the immediate future."
"The performance requirements and design approach used to develop the Intelsat III dual TWT power supply are discussed. In addition, final acceptance test performance data are examined. The dual TWT power supply described here provides power regulation and certain control functions for a 0.1 watt (R.F.) driver and a 12 watt (R.F.) power amplifier operating at 4 GHz. The supply operates from a spacecraft bus voltage of 22 to 31 volts and delivers nearly 2 KV to the high power TWT. Switching regulators are used so power dissipation remains low and virtually constant over the entire input voltage range. The supply is encapsulated and weighs 4.0 lbs. in its 10.6\" x 2.3\" x 3.5\" aluminum case."
"An analysis is made of the SCR chopper for the control of traction motors. The analysis divides the chopper period into several sub-divisions, the dynamic circuit equations for each time interval are derived and an on-line digital computer is used to determine the complete solution through an iterative process. Computer simulations over a wide range of possible design conditions are summarized. The results compare very favorably with test data from a prototype system."
"Anticipated new mission requirements have motivated research on very-high-frequency (VHF) regulated dc-to-dc converters to operate at conversion frequencies in the low-meghertz range. State-of-the-art electronic components for VHF operation are discussed. Two different converter configurations, one using proportional control and having a conversion frequency of 1.0 MHz and the other using bistable control and having a conversion frequency of 3.8 MHz, are presented to indicate converter performance in this VHF region. Converter losses, which are of prime importance at these frequencies, are discussed and possible means of reducing these losses are suggested."
"Various DC-DC converter input filter requirements as applied in spacecraft power processing equipment, are reviewed with respect to the spacecraft, its power source and filter loads. The conflicting implications arising from the requirements are noted. A filter configuration capable of providing a satisfactory overall compromise is presented. Various design aspects for converter input filters are analyzed. These include minimum weight toroid inductor design, the possibility of non-linear oscillation developing through the interaction of an input filter and a negative impedance regulator and problems in using paralleled capacitors to supply switching regulator loads."
"This paper describes the implementation and initial test results for a unique digital-analog solar array control concept wherein portions of the circuitry are electrically and physically integrated with the solar array subsystem. The concept has been developed to capitalize on the high efficiency and reliability advantages of the shunt regulator while minimizing the attendant thermal dissipation of excess array power. Thermal dissipation is minimized by digitally switching out those portions of the array which are not required by the load. The specific design described is for a nominal 2 kW unit which illustrates the control approach for a broad power range extending from 0.5 kW to greater than 20 kW. Radiation hardening was initial design goal and has been included since the beginning of the conceptual design phase. Computer circuit analysis and radiation simulation testing have been employed extensively to predict and verify unit performance in the total environment. Areas where this factor had a major influence on circuit design or component selection are discussed as well as the special circuits which have been included for protection against the radiation excited array."
"The power requirements for spacecraft have been increasing steadily from the watts requirements to kilowatts requirements. Simultaneously, however, the demands on reliability and simplicity of conversion circuits have been raised and the weight allowances in pound per kilowatt of conversion equipment have been lowered."
"Four different power conditioning circuits are described showing how the series resonant circuit can be used instead of the saturating transformer to determine opeating frequency. These circuits are a dc-to-squarewave inverter and an ac-to-ac frequency sextupler, both fully qualified for aerospace, a dc-to-dc converter and a dc-to-sinewave inverter, both in the successful prototype stage. Attention is given to the relation betwen damping constants and rejection ratios, and it is shown graphically how to take advantage of these features of the resonant circuit by suitable choice of isolating transformer turns ratios as related to load constants. The four circuits show how the careful use of these principles reult in superior frequency stability and, especially in the sinewave inverter, vitual elimination of high power switching transients, with resultant low generation of electromagnetic interference and extremely low electrical stresses in switching power transistors."
"Transient-free sinusoidal output can be achieved without circuit complexity in today's advanced static inverter where output waveform synthesis is done by time-optimal-response \"bang-bang\" or by \"bang-hang\" technique. A reference signal (usually a sine wave) is reproduced with high fidelity and good efficiency (80% to 92%) even under adverse conditions of dc source voltage modulation and non-linear ac loads. A universal single-phase inverter module that uses the time-optimal-response approach becomes effective in either single-phase or 3-phase modular arrays as a \"central\" as well as a \"local\" static inverter because it can compensate simultaneously for line and load disturbances."
"Development of a flight configured experimental power supply delivering 2 kw of conditioned power represents a concentrated effort at advancing the state-of-the-art in high voltage power supplies for space application. The power supply described herein was designed for use with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) 20 cm Mercury Ion Thruster. However, its modularized design philosophy allows adaptation to various high voltage, high power requirements. Areas of principal concern are design of power and control circuits, performance parameters, packaging, efficiency, and weight."
"A high efficiency, low weight silicon controlled rectifier power supply which supplies 28V @100A is described. The power supply operates from a conventional 3 phase 120/208Vdc (50 to 1600Hz) power source. The AC power source is converted directly to DC which powers two SCR inverters operating phase displaced up to 12.5 kHz. The two inverter outputs are rectified and fed into a common output filter to complete the final power conversion step. Output metering and input/output circuit breakers are provided in a rack mounted unit designed for natural convection cooling. Efficient, high frequency operation of the inverter SCR's makes possible the high overall power supply efficiency and low weight. Extremely stale and accurate voltage regulation is implemented. Additional features are inherent short circuit capability and adjustable output current limiting. Several aspects of circuit design and performance are discussed."
"The Pioneer F/G spacecraft is the first to use radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG's) for a long duration interplanetary mission. This paper describes the design of the spacecraft power subsystem which meets the unique requirements of such a mission. The primary power source consists of four SNAP 19 RTG's. The 4. 2 volt dc outputs of the RTG's are inverted to higher voltage ac by four inverters which are connected in parallel at their outputs. A power control unit (PCU) regulates the ac output of the inverters such that the RTG's are operated at near maximum power voltage throughout the mission. The PCU also contains charge and discharge controls for a silver cadmium battery which supplements the RTG's if load requirements temporarily exceed RTG power output. Battery reliability is enhanced by overcharge and cell reversal protection electronics which are provided for each cell. Multiple, low voltage, regulated dc outputs which supply power to the spacecraft subsystems are provided by a central transformer-rectifier-filter unit (CTRF). The CTRF operates directly from the regulated ac bus."
"The IDCSP/A satellites are communication satellites built by Philco-Ford Corporation under contract to the United States Air Force for United Kingdom applications, tailored for compatibility with the near synchronous IDCSP communication satellite network. These satellites utilize a mechanically despun antenna system and a hydrazine reaction control system for attitude control and station keeping. The design of these satellites utilizes advanced concepts reflecting current state-of-the-art. Design, integration, and test concepts of the IDCSP/A electrical power subsystem is discussed in this paper. This subsystem utilizes solar cells for primary power conversion and hermetically sealed nickel-cadmium batteries for enery storage. The power subsystem used in the IDCSP/A satellites has been designed to provide continuously regulated primary power to each satellite subsystem. This fully automatic power subsystem has been optimized to take full advantage of earth synchronous equatorial orbit characteristics. Flight data from the satellites demonstrates that the power subsystem is meeting or exceeding performance requirements."
"The design techniques, performances, and applications are described for two new types of transistorized sonar switching amplifiers which are used to drive large transducer arrays. The amplifiers are designed to drive complex impedances and are fully protected against shorts and open circuits on the output. Tests proved these amplifiers to be free from the effects of load variations, to have high efficiencies, not to require power interlocking, and to have accurate phase control. A s a result, transducer array designs are no longer limited by the effects of reactive loads on the amplifiers. Switching amplifiers with proper design will now absorb energy from the transducer array."
"An outline is given of the factors involved in the design of a system for powering oceanographic sensors inductively coupled to a long mooring cable, in particular where the total system power must be held to an absolute minimum. A calculation is made of the total power that is transmitted down the cable for given minimum power into the sensors, assuming a fixed impedance for the seawater return path. Designs for both split and solid core couplers are given. The split core coupler is the more difficult of the two to design, principally because the highly corrosive saltwater environment precludes the use of cut metal cores so that lower permeability ferrite cores must be used."
"Design of all avionic systems on future aircraft is tied to the past by MIL-STD-704. Despite dramatic advances in performance and reliability of the avionic equipments, the power conditioning section of each subsystem must still tolerate wide frequency swings on a transient basis, long power interruptions, large voltage transients, and unbalanced phase voltages. During the past decade, General Electric has deveopled the variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) generation equipment under sponsorship by the U.S. Navy and Air Force. The power quality available through VSCF systems represents a significant improvement over that required by MIL-STD-704. The weapon system improvements achievable through the use of this improved power were reviewed and assessed on existing production avionic subsystems. Proposed next generation avionic systems were also assessed to determine relative benefits achievable for new designs. Parameters considered were power dissipation, weight, volume, reliability, performance and cost. Data from this study on specific equipments was extrapolated to the avionic systems of future aircraft and cost and weight projections were made for both avionics and airframes."
"The trend of commercial aircraft today is toward larger size and more electric service power. As the aircraft becomes larger and environmental conditions become more severe, stringent design requirements such as a high degree of reliability, minimum operating cost, and minimum weight are imposed on the aircraft electrical power system. In reviewing the electrical power systems installed in present day aircraft, it is found that despite many improvements, the basic approach of these systems is virtually the same as about 20 years ago. In the light of recent technological advances in various related fields and the change of aircraft electrical power system requirements, a reevaluation of the conventional approach is in order. In recognition of this, a study program was initiated in 1968 by NASA Electronics Research Center to investigate possible improvements to present aircraft electrical power systems for use in future advanced types of aircraft. Study results indicate that many avenues are available for improving the present system, such as variable-speed, constant-frequency generation, optimization of system voltage and frequency, solid-state power switching and control, automatic load management, signal multiplexing, failure prediction, detection, and compensation, to name a few. A detailed discussion of these improvements is beyond the scope of this presentation. This paper specifically presents a projected development trend and depicts an example of a hybrid electrical power system offering reduced weight and improved reliability and maintainability."
"The Army is currently investigating new means of power conversion that eventually will lead toward new light weight hardware in order to improve land mobility. Application of solid state power technology has been of particular interest to the Army due to its potentially attractive cost to life cycle performance ratio. However, one of the important design considerations for this new equipment is correct fusing since some means for protection of components is necessary in case of a catastrophic failure elsewhere in the system. The presently available cartridge type thyristor fuse must be replaced after each catastrophic failure. This imposes latent logistic problems assuming the Army must stock fuses worldwide to sustain its global mission. It is in this context that various forms of re-usable fuse mechanisms are discussed, existing ways as well as proposed means, to protect solid state switches, especially thyristors, against catastrophic fault current amplitudes."
"The Army needs a light weight, reliable and economical uninterruptible power conditioner (UPC) capable of converting those input voltages and frequencies from various power sources to power conforming to military standards. Only static UPC was assumed to have the potential to meet military objectives. The alternative approaches vary in degree of risk, cost, weight and performance growth potential. The circuitry and performance characteristics for three approaches are discussed. The limitations of existing solid state devices are discussed. Predictions of physical characteristics for future UPC utilizing these technologies and circuits are provided."
"For many years, high pressure mercury lamps, so familiar to all of us as street lights, stadium lights, or manufacturing shop lights, have been operated with series inductive ballasts. Recently, however, new types of lamps having characteristics different from those of the common mercury vapor lamp have been developed, requiring new families of inductive ballasts. To eliminate the problem of providing a different ballast for each lamp, and to provide improved ballast performance, a hybrid solid-state circuit has been developed which will operate all of the presently available lamps. This circuit, called a Quadmaster Ballast, includes a series inductor and an AC switch, together with circuitry which causes the AC switch to be triggered at the proper time to regulate lamp power. All of the presently available 400 watt street lamps (mercury, metal halide and sodium) can be operated by simply installing the lamp into the fixture."
"The Power Converter design for the Lunar Roving Vehicle Navigation Subsystem is described. The Lunar Roving program is summarized in sufficient detail to define the mission and operating environment. Certain Navigation Subsystem design trades pertinent to Power Converter requirements are discussed. A block diagram of the Power Converter is shown and described. Detail circuits are shown, with discussion of design trades, unique features, and performance. The Power Converter consists of a 28VDC switching preregulator, a DC-to-DC converter, three DC voltage regulators providing ±16VDC and +5VDC, and a 115VAC 4.00 Hertz inverter. Design trades considered circuit configurations, parts selection including choices between integrated circuits and discrete components, and functional choices such as exclusion of current limiting or equivalent short circuit protection. Finally, packaging design of the Navigation Subsystem and its Power Converter are briefly reviewed with comments on advantages and disadvantages of the selected design."
"A power conditioning and control system design for a colloid thruster is described. Operating requirements are set forth and a block diagram is presented illustrating the overall approach used in providing the requisite outputs and controls. The basic power circuit is illustrated and overall performance, design characteristics and unique features are discussed. The power processor consists of various circuits which convert 28Vdc power to the levels necessary for operating a one millipound colloid thruster system. The following supplies and functions are provided: · +12.3KVdc needle supply (47 watts) · -1.85KVdc extractor supply · Mass flow controller · Neutralizer heater controller · Thruster temperature controller · Command and protection system · Telemetry signal conditioning (for monitoring thruster performance) The discussion includes descriptions of short circuit characteristics, fault protection, efficiency, weight, grounding and fault isolation philosophy and high voltage transformer design."
"The Criteria for Nuclear Power Generating Station Protection Systems, IEEE Std 279-1971, establish minimum requirements for the safety-related functional performance and reliability of the protection system for stationary, land-based nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. These requirements include, but are not limited to,the capability for testing the protection system. In order to develop tests and establish test procedures, an expansion and interpretation of the test capabilities specified in IEEE Std 279-1971 is necessary."
   "The simplest and probably the most widely used method of transcribing color television picture information from magnetic tape to color film is to photograph a color TV picture displayed on a shadow-mask tube. Although this method can give good results, many examples exist which fall far short of optimum. The authors discuss the chief problems and the solutions they have found. — The chief components of the transcription system are: Ampex VR-2000 tape recorder; CBS Laboratories Image Enhancer, Model 526; RCA Stabilizing Amplifier, Model TA-9; Conrac monitor specially fitted with a Zenith Chromacolor picture tube and with several electronic changes, which are described; 16 mm Eastman Television Recording Camera, Model 2, fitted with a Leitz Noctilux 50mm f/1.2 lens. Control was exercised by means of a combination color bar and 5-step gray scale standardizing test signal and a photometer for measuring picture tube light output. Using the Zenith Chromacolor tube and the Noctilux lens set at f/1.4 it has been found practical to record on Eastman Ektachrome Commercial Film 7252, processed to twice normal speed. Prints are made on Eastman Reversal Color Print Film 7387. Procedures for setting up the monitor to achieve optimum resolution and correct color rendition have been established."
"The introduction of automation into television station operations offers advantages in staff utilization and data handling that have become more apparent as equipment has become more sophisticated. To take maximum advantage requires that station design and operation be adapted to the requirements of automation. The problems that arise in an average existing station where this ideal situation does not exist are outlined, together with an estimate of the probable future development of automation systems."
"The increasing use of 16mm color film for television necessitates a close examination of its technical performance. An investigation into the image unsteadiness encountered in typical 16mm films and the contributory causes of this defect are described. Tests have been made to determine the degree of steadiness necessary to give satisfactory television presentation and the subjective loss of picture quality caused by various magnitudes of types of unsteadiness."
"Root-mean-square granularity numbers have become an increasingly accepted parameter for ranking the relative graininess of photographic films. The significance of the number and the method of measurement are reviewed. The relationship of granularity to the graininess of the photographic image is dependent on the contrast, density level and measuring-instrument characteristics. The influence of print films on negative graininess is dependent on the contrast and sharpness of the print stock and the characteristics of the printer."
"Conventional looping techniques, while necessary, are frequently time consuming; their mechanics increase markedly the post-production costs. A system has been developed that employs computer technology to permit a significant reduction in the mechanics of looping. The techniques of the system are discussed."
"Since 1945 there has been a tremendous advance in the theory of servo-mechanisms; in the motion-picture industry there have been a number of advances in the design of film take-up and tension devices, but most of these designs appear to have been rather empirical. A set of solutions and dimensionless graphs is presented which may be employed in solving some of these problems. A general analysis of a simple servo system such as might be used for a film take-up, film feed or a constant tension device shows how the initial differential equations are derived and then solved via Laplace transforms. The solutions are given in the time domain. The results are graphs in generalized coordinates from which tension overshoot, time of maximum overshoot and steady-state error may be predicted. Included in the analysis are tachometer and network compensation. Also included are the proper selection of motors, gear ratios and tension arms."
"The opening session of the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the International Organization for Standardization Technical Committee 36 on Cinematography was highlighted by the warm reception given to the Delegates by Mr. J. Brown, speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom and the British Standards Institution which hosted the meeting. Mr. J. Brown, Manager of the Mechanical Division of the British Standards Institution, taking note of the ever-growing tasks facing the group and the extreme importance of establishing international accord on the many technical questions, congratulated the Committee on the high degree of agreement already achieved."
"Among the current committee activities, super 8 standardization is an important portion. The status of the various super 8 projects is shown by the tabulation below as prepared by Roland J. Zavada, Chairman of the American National Standards Institute Committee PH22.—A.E.A."

     "Interest in the information transmission capability of the segments of the television signal primarily intended for synchronization is not new to the television industry. As early as 1953 a technique was developed in Germany utilizing the vertical blanking interval of the television signal for the transmission of test signals.1 By 1956 use of the vertical interval for test signal transmission was authorized, here in the United States and soon became widespread. The 98th Technical Conference of the SMPTE, held in Montreal, in November 1965, devoted a session to Television Transmission Testing which included three papers on the use of the vertical interval.2–4 Subsequently, much imaginative use has been found in both the vertical and the horizontal blanking intervals for information not necessarily related to the accompanying program material. Inasmuch as several of the proposed usages are conflicting in their intended assignment of the available television lines, it was felt appropriate to review the situation at this time."
"The Vertical Interval Test Signals (VITS) are useful for monitoring, measuring and/or correcting the performance of TV transmission systems while the systems are in service. The VIT Signals recommended by the Video Transmission Engineering Advisory Committee (VITEAC) have shortcomings in that they use up valuable “real estate” in the vertical interval and yet do not permit some of the more important parameters to be measured. The Omni-VIT Signal described in this paper uses only one TV line out of six available and yet permits the measurement of 13 transmission parameters, all of which are important for good color broadcasting. Since the Omni-VIT Signal uses only one line, it is possible to insert up to six signals at various points along a linked-up transmission path; thus it can be determined at the output of the system which of the links introduces excessive distortion."
"The introduction of color television has imposed stringent requirements on the performance of networks and transmitters, while, at the same time, steady progress towards achieving a nationwide two-channel coverage on UHF has necessitated a considerable increase in the number of transmitting stations. The use of improved techniques permits unattended operation of many of the transmitters and provides improved reliability with a significant decrease in installation and operating costs. This paper deals only with the automatic monitoring of unattended operation and describes, in broad outline, equipment which has been developed for monitoring and executive control purposes, both at transmitters and other strategic points on the network. Associated with the monitoring function is the transmission of appropriate data and mention is also made of the various data transmission systems which have been developed for this purpose."
"The adoption of the NTSC color television system about 20 years ago added the entire new dimension of color to the television signal without any increase in required bandwidth. Although of considerably smaller scope, many ingenious techniques have been developed for the insertion of ancillary communications within the television signal. Within the active video portion of the signal such techniques have provided for an emergency channel for the sound portion of the signal. Employing portions of the horizontal blanking interval, high quality audio channels can be provided using pulse amplitude, pulse code or pulse width modulation techniques. Within the audio portion of the television signal many systems have been developed which involve unobtrusive audio tones for alerting station personnel, for the automatic control of equipment and for program or commercial identification. Several systems are also under consideration which involve tones designed for alerting the general public in times of a national emergency."
"After some years of work on the subject, a draft proposal for sound reproduction in cinemas was released by the Scandinavian Film- and T.V. Society in 1969. Since that time 100 public cinemas have been measured in accordance with the specifications in the proposal. This paper describes the technique used and presents the results, to date."
"In order to record x-ray diffraction patterns with exposure times of less than 200 ns, an image intensifier is used along with a flash x-ray tube. Examples of x-ray diffraction patterns are given and records are shown which have been taken in the case of rapid dynamic changes such as the electric explosion of a metal foil."
"The high-speed camera has become an important tool for both qualitative and quantitative research in the dynamics of mechanical systems. The wide range of resolution times and durations of interest has led to the development of a number of different types of photographic systems. Multiple-image cameras have been highly developed but are necessarily complicated and cannot give information continuous in time. For those cases where measurements need only be made in one space dimension, the streak camera is a useful alternative to making separate images. The construction and operation of a simple single-lens streak camera built to operate in the microsecond resolution range is described. It uses an open shutter and multiple mirrors so that the recording time is triggered by the event, either because it is self luminous, such as an explosion, or by allowing the event to trigger a light pulse of controlled duration."
"A major design and development program was undertaken to evolve a substantially new configuration 16mm handheld camera. This camera was designed to comply with present military requirements for a lightweight, self-powered camera for use by combat cinematographers. With performance specifications comparable to existing professional studio equipment, the magazine-loaded camera was to feature a crystal-controlled motor and a pin-registered film-transport mechanism. Early in the development phases of the program, several unusual features were “frozen” into the design, which had a significant effect on the internal configuration of the camera. These features included a combined motor and shutter, in which the rotor of the hysteresis synchronous motor is a cobalt annulus laminated to the periphery of the shutter “wheel.” The claw-type film-transport mechanism design criteria are defined and evaluated."
"The meeting was called to order by the President, as Chairman, at the conclusion of the Get-Together Luncheon. The Executive Secretary, having in his possession 1042 signed proxies, a quorum was declared to be present in person and by proxy."
"Ub Iwerks, master of motion-picture special effects, and perhaps the most gifted of twentieth century motion-picture cartoonists, passed away, July 7th, 1971, at the age of 70"
           "In a paper entitled “Trends in Television Recording” published in this Journal last year, the importance of recorded programming in the schedules of all three U.S. commercial television networks was examined, and the nature of television programs recorded on video tape and those recorded on motion-picture film were compared. — This new paper examines video tape and film production techniques in greater detail than the earlier report to show that it is the differences in production techniques rather than differences in the recording media themselves that account for much of the present split in recorded programming between motion-picture film and video tape. This paper then describes a new electronic production system that will make it possible to produce film-type programs on video tape faster, more economically, and with higher quality than is presently possible on film."
"Differential gain (DG) and differential phase (DP) are measures of the variation in the amplitude and phase, respectively, of the chrominance signal with changes in the amplitude of the luminance signal. The effect of DG and DP distortions are to change the color saturations and hue of the transmitted color in an NTSC TV signal. Subjective evaluations of the impairing effects of DG and DP are necessary in order to establish acceptable limits on TV transmission. Subjective tests were designed to obtain the subjective evaluations of different types and magnitudes of DG and DP distortions. The results of these tests indicate that the mean levels of DP which are rated “just perceptible” or better range from approximately 7° to over 18° depending on the type of DP distortion studied. Similarly, the mean levels of DG which were rated “just perceptible” or better range from approximately 2.4 dB to 3.7 dB depending on the type of DG distortion tested."
"Delay difference between the luminance and chrominance information of the NTSC color television signal causes colors to shift to the left or right of objects in the viewed color picture. This delay difference can occur during the processing or transmission of the color signal resulting in two basic delay difference types. Flat delay is the type of delay difference that can occur when the luminance and chrominance signals are separated, as frequently happens during signal processing, and is a function of the absolute delays of the separate luminance and chrominance signal paths. Shaped delay can occur during the transmission of the composite color signal and is a function of the delay characteristic of the transmission system. A series of subjective tests was designed to evaluate the effects of both flat and shaped delay on color TV pictures. Expert observers used a seven-point comment scale ranging from “not perceptible” to “extremely objectionable,” to rate picture impairments resulting from various magnitudes of delay difference."
"The LogEtronics, Inc., Focatron Image Sharpness Meter, when used as a tool to determine optimum focus on motion-picture optical printers, yields accurate results in a simple and efficient manner. The Focatron unit was tested and found successful in an Eastman Kodak Co. motion-picture laboratory where high quality requirements exist. This unit proved particularly useful during daily printer changeovers and provided the operators with a convenient and simple method to afford daily printer focus checks."
"The Spectra® Film Gate Photometer consists of a readout unit and a series of probes which are inserted in the film gate of color printers; one of these probes is described in detail. The probe is designed to monitor and help maintain optimum performance (color balance, density and uniformity) of continuous printers. It measures the average irradiance (exposure) through red, green and blue filters, and also measures the illumination uniformity in ten small increments across the width of the 35mm aperture. The ability to check both illumination uniformity and average exposure level in a single device is made possible by use of a unique electrooptical design which utilizes a segmented photodetector in conjunction with electronic scanning."
"Extensive use and better understanding of the full potentialities of zoom lenses have resulted in the evolution of new techniques of studio operation and viewer presentation in broadcast television. The emerging pattern of future usage and the present state of the optical art suggest that many of the types of zoom lenses in use today may have reached the limits of modification and improvement. Although the tendency toward smaller studio settings is an important factor, there are other aspects of operation and viewer presentation which put additional emphasis on the requirements of wider angular field of view and shorter working distances. It is this emphasis which indicates that new optical principles of construction are essential for the future. A family of zoom lenses has recently been developed that employs three moving members instead of the conventional two, thus providing more numerous and more useful optical design variables while at the same time combining optical and mechanical compensation for image shift in a manner which simplifies some of the mechanical problems which at present are typical of mechanically compensating systems."
"Motion pictures were well established long before television, and programs on film gave broadcasters their only alternative to direct live transmissions to the public in the early developmental stages. From a bold start in 1956, videotape has surged rapidly ahead to give broadcasters a near-ideal television recording medium. As the proponents of videotape strive to make this medium less costly and more versatile, there are some who already concede film's defeat. But other, perhaps more astute, observers of the television scene insist that the competition has only just begun, and it is by no means certain that videotape will emerge the victor. Drastic changes in conventional motion-picture production practices will have to be made to enable film to compete successfully with the increasingly sophisticated methods of program production on tape."
"Because of the magnitude of the coverage, together with extremely tight scheduling, and logistics and maintenance problems, the closed-circuit telecasting of the Ali-Frazier fight was a remarkable success for the medium. Some 369 locations in the United States and Canada and 50 international locations, via satellite, were served. The international broadcasting was a complete success; and of the 1.5 million paid admissions in the U.S. and Canada, only 0.7% failed to receive a picture."

   "Glass beads of 30- to 140-μm diameter and 50 to 100 m/s velocity emerging from a plasma flame (10,000 K) were photographed using a 16mm high-speed ciné camera in streak mode. The combined radiation from the hot particles and that reflected from the flame provided sufficient light intensity using 400 ASA reversal film. The narrow depth of field (±5 mm) was investigated using an illuminated spinning disc having a hole the same size as the particle. A stereo streak system was devised for particle location in two dimensions. Ghost images caused by internal lens reflection were identified on the film. A simple system for film analyzing was built and a semiautomatic electrical disc analog for measuring streak angle was devised and tested. Overall optical resolution was sufficient to enable particle accelerations (2,000 g) to be estimated from the changes of streak angle across the film."
"The need for assigning numerical values to subjective picture quality is discussed. The applicability is investigated of the British Post Office impairment units to published American results on the subjective effects of differential gain, differential phase, relative chrominance delay and signal-to-noise ratio. The summability property of these impairment units is also checked, as far as the aforementioned USA results permit, and the results tend to indicate that it indeed holds."
"Investigations have been made into methods of digitally analyzing television test signals to be used in a prototype automatic monitoring equipment. To allow, wherever possible, maximum compatibility with existing manual methods, the already established insertion test signals (ITS) were employed. A preliminary survey confirmed that the component waveforms of ITS were generally amenable to digital analysis, although in some cases the approach would have to be quite different from that adopted for manual assessment. The effects of noise had to be taken into account. Suitable methods were found to be available for analyzing insertion test signals by means of an on-line digital computer to obtain the relevant transmission quality parameters."
"The ever increasing demand for higher technical quality of motion-picture films has forced the film laboratories into ever more rigid process control and monitoring. One phase of monitoring film stock and processing machines consists of processing film strips exposed to known light levels. In a large laboratory several of these sensitized strips are processed in one day. Since these strips will be a standard for the entire lab, the accuracy with which they are produced is of ultimate importance. Secondly, when a large number of strips are used, the means of producing these strips should be fairly automatic. Design specifications and manufacture of a Type 2B sensitometer which is capable of producing such strips are described."
"There is a need by television broadcasters for an operational gray-scale slide which is stable, achromatic, non-scattering and of known transmission values. This slide should be used at the field lens position of a mutliplexed telecine to permit color balancing and shading operations with each of the multi-projector inputs, and to allow tracking and gamma adjustments of the camera. Conventional silver and dye image slides do not satisfy these requirements. A new test slide, made made from a metal alloy evaporated on glass, has been designed and constructed for this purpose. Experience with this slide has shown it to perform as intended in a variety of telecine equipments."
"During 1970, Eastman Kodak Co. undertook a project intended to improve the quality of television images obtained from film. A task force, trained in the setup and operational procedures of television color film chains and studio color monitors, made calls on all television stations in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) and in Puerto Rico. All stations having vidicon or Plumbicon color film chains were given a demonstration of the excellent quality that can be obtained from film on a properly adjusted television film chain. To provide for an independent method of evaluating color film for television, a direct projection system was set up to show that a close approximation on a color monitor set to the recommended D6500 is possible."
"Television and motion-picture coverage of the Apollo 15 mission before, during and after the lift-off from Kennedy Space Center, through the landing on the moon, the lift-off from the moon and the flight back to earth, is an impressive tribute to the ingenuity and dedication of the men in the television and motion-picture industries."
"The Association held a one-day conference at the Imperial College, London, on September 20, 1971, covering a variety of topics. The Association Chairman, R. J. North, welcomed members and introduced the morning session chairman, D. A. Barnsley, and M. B. Prudence, the afternoon session chairman. Four papers were presented in the morning session, the first of which was “Observation of MIG Welding Arcs,” by M. Quigley and J. Webster (who read the paper) of the March-wood Engineering Laboratories."
"President Wilton R. Holm has announced the resignation of D. Max Beard, Silver Spring, Md., as United States Delegate to the International Committee on High-speed Congresses, due to his retirement from government service. He has been replaced in this assignment by Carlos H. Elmer, Scottsdale, Ariz., formerly SMPTE Vice-President for Photo-Instrumentation Affairs."
               "The electronically switched Kerr cell has for many years been used as a shutter in ultra-high-speed photographic systems and is capable of framing times as fast as 1 ns. A new type of optically driven Kerr cell is more than 100 times faster; it has been used to photograph laser pulses in flight. Pulses of 0.53-μm (green) light 6 ps in duration, which were derived by second harmonic generation from a mode-locked Nd: glass laser, were passed through a cell containing a colloidal dispersion. The dispersion, which is an efficient scatterer, thus rendered the light pulses visible. They were then photographed from the side by a camera positioned behind a shutter of 10-ps framing time. The shutter is similar in configuration to the conventional Kerr cell, but differs in that no electrodes are used and the medium is CS2 rather than nitrobenzene. Peak transmission of the shutter is dependent upon the power density of the 1.06-μm pulses, and in this case is typically 5–10%."
"The most widely used method of introducing titling into programing is by superimposition. A second technique is the utilization of character-generation devices. The character generators previously available were designed primarily to make computer generated characters compatible with the TV scan. The system, the Vidifont, synthetically reproduces a graphic arts style character with sufficient resolution to be compatible with the superimposition technique. Major design considerations are discussed including system considerations and font design and character size. The Vidifont provides four basic functions: interface, timing and control, storage and character generation."
"One of the worst problems for TV broadcasters is the unexpected introduction of 60 Hz hum into the video signal by ground potential differences at locations separated a few hundred feet or more. These potential differences are usually caused by unbalances and various grounding practices in ac power systems which are not under control of the broadcasters. Frequently the hum differs by several volts and when a cable carries such a spurious signal the video signal frequently cannot be easily “cleaned up” satisfactorily. A system has been developed which obviates the need for balanced lines, or clamps, or differential amplifiers. It uses a so-called “Hum-Bucker Coil” in the video cable, which is actually a 60-Hz transformer wherein the unwanted ground potential difference is applied across the primary. The resulting secondary voltage is of a phase and amplitude for exact cancellation of the pre-existing hum voltage on the cable. This action is achieved with negligible picture signal degradation or attenuation. Measurements on a small hum-bucker show that more than 50-dB reduction of hum can be achieved. At the same time, quality degradation is only equivalent to that caused by video transmission through a few feet of small-size coaxial cable."
"Neither the human eye nor the conventional two- and three-color meters offer sufficient spectral correlation to accurately predict the color balance for high-quality photographic color reproduction from such light sources as xenon arcs and fluorescent lamps. The problem is that the spectral sensitivity of the human eye or of existing meters does not precisely match the spectral sensitivity of the color film/motion-picture camera system. A new three-color meter was developed, the spectral sensitivity of which is precisely matched to typically important cine camera lens and film combinations. The spectral sensitivity is precisely matched to that of Eastman Color Negative Type 5254 film, as modified by the spectral transmittance of typical cine lenses; this combination also closely approximates the spectral sensitivity of many other important film and lens combinations. Split-screen photographic tests were designed to determine the correlation between meter readings and color film response. In every case, excellent correlation was obtained between the color balance indicated and the color balance obtained on color film."
"Measurements on a large number of films made for television broadcasting permit quantitative statements concerning the densities of film reproductions of white objects, of black objects and of flesh. Good picture quality is associated with films having the density of important white areas between 0.30 and 0.40. The density of significant black areas of good quality film centers around 2.5. Color density measurements of flesh reproduction form the basis for a quantitative description of the color variability of motion-picture films. Color balance and density of 35mm program films match the SMPTE Reference Test Films very well; 16mm prints are measurably colder in balance. Commercials are generally lighter and colder than program material, and their variation is much greater. Newsfilm is usually greener than program film, but its variation is surprisingly small, being mostly along the illuminant axis."
"The Canadian Telecasting Practices Committee (CTPC) has issued its practice CTP 1, “Viewing Rooms for Evaluation of 16mm Color Film for Television.” CTP 1 is based on work done by the CBC to improve the quality of television film programs. CTP 1 has been applied for the first time in the CBC Toronto Film Dept. Four film review rooms have been built with a common and separate projection room; the rooms can be operated independently of one another. The purpose of each room is to evaluate film quality from the point of view of the television viewer. To this end the screen has been built to look like a 25-in television monitor; a surround light has been provided. The listening environment has been designed to allow adequate evaluation of the soundtrack. A working desk, at the proper distance from the screen, includes remote controls of all projector circuits. It also houses a film timer and audio-level monitoring and control. The decor is pleasing and comfortable, as required for long periods of work by the film evaluators. Salient features of the equipment are described; of particular interest is the method of obtaining the surround light from the side of the lamphouse of the 16mm projector using a separate optical system."
"The British Kinematograph Sound and Television Society has developed a standard reference color film leader to serve as an aid in more precise control of color balance in television film transmission. It is available in negative form for insertion in master material prior to printing for control of laboratory processing, and as a positive print for reference in the alignment of telecine equipment."
"TWO PROCEDURES for adjusting telecine colour balance are described. The first makes use of selected test materials to assist the setting of telecine colour balance to a mode which gives optimum reproduction of the film colour balance. Such material is used in Thames Television when aligning equipment used for television commercial replay. The second procedure makes use of a leader grey scale, obtained from the BKSTS reference negative, and auxiliary colour balancing equipment to correct any residual tracking errors which may occur in the print stock used for a particular film production. These two forms of telecine colour balance operation are referred to as NEUTRAL GATE and NEUTRAL LEADER. The uses of a high quality reference picture print in telecine are also discussed and final sections illustrate various methods of monitoring the equality of signals obtained from televised grey scales."
"The appraisal of films intended for the international exchange of programmes for colour television has frequently involved difficulties due to differing standards of performance in telecine channels. Telecine apparatus exists in a wide range of technical specifications which may vary from a highly complex design incorporating many refinements, both colorimetric and electronic, to a simple uncorrected colour analyser and many problems of film quality are ultimately found to be attributable to telecine performance. Difficulties also arise because the majority of interests involved in the production of films, particularly film-processing laboratories, do not have television apparatus and are found to carry out their quality-control under very variable conditions. It is clearly desirable that where a film is a subject of international exchange the successive appraisals of its technical characteristics should be carried out in a standard manner. — In addition to its universal availability, optical projection has many fewer variables than a colour television system and, until a worldwide standard for telecine performance can be realised, it is to be preferred for appraisal purposes."
"Mr. Zwick: Because the reviewing and. evaluation of films. for television have been matters of concern and debate we have a panel of persons informed on various aspects of the problem. Each panelist will present briefly his position or feelings and raise questions for others to answer; then the session will be open to questions and discussions from all sources."
"The editing, assembly, and convenient use of motion-picture film requires that film splices be easily made, and be invisible in the projected image. In those applications when polyester film base is preferred for its balance of physical properties, splicing of such film base has not yet become convenient. Thermal weld splices can be produced on polyester, however, and the simplicity of one procedure has now been demonstrated with a prototype tabletop unit for the thermal butt-weld splicing of 35mm polyester motion-picture film. — The welding process employs radiant heating to achieve fusion. The film is initially positioned and trimmed to lengths that provide about 0.035 in of additional length in the splice area, compressed into a butt-weld after two seconds of heating. The excess length is forced out of the film plane into a bead, which is then skived away. The necessary orientation and crystallinity of the polyester base are maintained over most of the splice area by controlled, rapid heating and cooling. A group of tests has been developed to evaluate both the weld and its adjacent areas, and has been correlated with practical use. Design data are presented."
"The Autumn Conference of the Association for High-Speed Photography met at the Imperial College, London, on September 28, 1970, to hear reports from the 9th International Congress on High-Speed Photography, held in Denver last August."
            "The gap between film and television lighting methods is closing rapidly. Before attempting to adopt modern lightweight television equipment in film studios, the whole overhead grid structure and lighting operating methods needed to be radically changed. Also, from a financial viewpoint, film companies were understandably against scrapping tremendous amounts of very serviceable lighting equipment and spending vast sums on what was to them untried equipment and new methods. The main problem to tackle in the early stages was that of adapting a TV style grid that would accept the quick transfer and positioning of overhead telescopic lighting units and would also be strong enough to hang normal lighting cradles until such times as they could be dispensed with altogether. Four modern dual-purpose stages of 10,000 ft2 each have been built with TV grids installed. All the present pole-operated, incandescent equipment will, in the near future, be changed over to remote control, not only for the main functions of panning, tilting and focusing but also for the individual movement of each barndoor flap and its rotation, using only one motor to operate all eight movements."
"The remote control of telecine equipment of various manufacturers, in various combinations, is complicated by the nonstandard control circuits and command signals in use. By using a standard interface unit between the projectors and the remote control system, standardized command signals and consistent status indications can be used, the remote control panels can be kept simple, and telecine modifications are minimal. Automated switching systems can be incorporated into the remote control path at any time. The problem of handling both digital and analog controls is discussed, and the use of hard-wired and coded control systems are compared; a description of a typical installation is included, together with recommendations for future designs."
"With the advent of the one-inch format videotape, there has been an increasing growth in the use of closed-circuit TV techniques in management training influencing a number of major corporations to build into their corporate headquarters small TV facilities. Some basic criteria upon which to base decisions in planning the TV facility are proposed. The design of the TV studio is related to what the camera sees, budget considerations for lighting control systems, production equipment, rigging, draperies and scenic elements. The interior treatment of the TV studio may provide built-in scenery for flexibility of the studio if it is compatible with the television system. The basic production requirements of the studio proper as well as such ancillary areas as control room, make-up and dressing rooms, scenic and property storage areas are defined."
"In the study of noises coming from gaseous supercritical jets the waves were investigated by four separate methods in order to cross check the results. With the use of an electronic camera a film was made showing the evolution of acoustic waves. A sound analysis was made using a narrow passband analyzer and a microphone sensitive to high frequency. Schlieren photographs show that the waves on one side are out of phase relatively to those on the other side. Convergent-divergent nozzles were used giving Mach numbers from 1 to 4 comparable to sonic nozzles. The jet has a cellular structure at the exit as shown on shadowgraph pictures. “Screeches” occur when the jet is overexpanded. A specific ratio of pressure exists for each nozzle which brings about maximum screech. Frequency of oscillation was determined from 16 views filmed by the schlieren and shadowgraph methods. Two schlieren photographs demonstrate that a reflector at the origination of the jet diminishes jet screech by 20 dB."
"In the design or evaluation of color television cameras, one of the important considerations is measuring and assessing the reproducibility of colors. However, measurement of signals from the camera and calculations of colorimetric coordinates of reproduced colors is very troublesome. And quantitative assessment of its results also is very difficult because of psychological complexity in color recognition by the human eye. On the other hand, color picture quality needs to be improved in daily broadcasting by eliminating differences between cameras, programs and stations. Therefore, a colorimetric measuring instrument has been developed; it consists of a channel scanner, a picture element pointer, a sample holder, an A-D converter and a small computer. This instrument can automatically estimate the colorimetric distortion caused by a camera with reasonable precision, and quickly enough for the estimation to be applied to succeeding improvement tests. Details of the design of the instrument and the results of testing with cameras are given."
"A multichannel audio recorder/reproducer with a pulse-driven, digitally controlled, drive and control system differs radically in design from standard audio recorder/reproducer. The normal 3-phase synchronous motor is replaced with a pulse coincidence motor which will start or stop in less than 5 ms and thus offers new modes of control and interlock with either film cameras, projectors or videotape machines. The interface of the pulse coincidence principle is used in conjunction with film interlocking, automatic videotape editing and audio mixing facilities. Digital counters, coincidence circuits and comparators have been developed to provide automatic search and location presetting of prerecorded audio sequences as well as interface equipment such as Hall-effect heads."
"Plated magnetic discs are now available to store video information which can be reproduced millions of times. With plated discs, the designer can manipulate the key magnetic parameters to suit his particular needs. The coercivity, remanent flux, loop squareness and frequency-response characteristics can be readily changed. In addition, the use of a variety of plated overcoats can produce discs with a high hardness and a low coefficient of friction. The development of these techniques now permits the production of discs which operate at substantially lower writing speeds to achieve a given signal performance. Methods of measuring the essential characteristics of plated magnetic discs have also been developed.* While precision-plated discs cannot compete with oxide-coated discs in price, their cost can be justified in applications where higher performance is required."
                     "It is Almost a tradition that when our Society holds a technical conference in Los Angeles, the President includes in his opening remarks some comments about Hollywood, the state of the industry, what technology did for it yesterday, and what technology promises to do tomorrow. I have had so many requests to consider this in depth, that I shall do just that. I do this, not because I believe areas of interest other than the motion-picture industry are less important, but because I think the question of whether or not Hollywood can survive as an entity is of over-riding importance at this time and in this place. And it seems somehow appropriate that I should do this, because it was the motion-picture industry that gave birth to this Society way back in 1916."
"Color and color changes of the skin and other body tissues can reveal important medical diagnostic information. The relevant color effects are sometimes so small that they are at or below the threshold of the color discriminating power of the eye. In particular this applies to skin color changes due to peripheral blood-flow. A system for expanded display of small color differences employing color television techniques is described. In the case of color effects due to peripheral bloodflow, a sixfold expansion of skin color changes appears to be feasible, yielding great improvement of diagnostic procedures. Design considerations for the system are presented and experimental results are described."
"Binocular three-dimensional (3D) techniques and their application to television are discussed. Of the several possible implementations described, some require special viewing glasses; others do not. Quantitative physiological and geometric criteria of 3D TV system design are summarized from the viewpoint of minimizing viewer eye strain and maximizing display realism. Included are specifications for allowable display depth range, depth resolution and the interaction between camera and display parameters. A generalized analysis of 3D displays not requiring special glasses shows that their applicability is very limited, leading to the final conclusion that 3D TV for general home application must be based on special viewing glasses."
"A new video gain-control circuit having both fade-control and keying functions has been developed. An amplifier using this single gain-control circuit can mix, wipe and fade-key, so that there is no need of color subcarrier phase alignment upon functional selection. The amplifier using the gain-control circuit exhibits an outstanding performance when used in a color composite signal switching system, since the sync and color burst can always pass through the amplifier at a constant level without by-passing."
"The tendency of TV broadcasters to rely increasingly upon videotape record/ playback equipment to solve the complex problems of daily program operations as well as generation of specially assembled program material creates new performance requirements for the equipment, particularly in the area of servo systems. The new performance requirements are described, such as improved stability of the record servo system for high-quality recordings, increased dynamic range and correction bandwidth of the pixlock servo, and ability to cope with nonsynchronously switched recording intervals with minimum visible playback disturbance. The advent of new circuit techniques and system design philosophies such as the utilization of digital process control, digital servo error detection and a high-efficiency “hybrid” power amplifier has enabled the design of a new capstan and headwheel servo system which meets the above-mentioned requirements."
"Because direct photographing of the precipitation growth processes is thwarted by the scattered light of cloud droplets and the immense scale over which these processes occur, to obtain photographic evidence of precipitation growth, cloud conditions have been modeled in a laboratory. A large vertical wind tunnel has been used to support thousands of drops in an updraft. To optimize the conditions, a high-speed camera and a lens affording a high degree of variability were selected. To obtain a sharp boundary definition, drops were silhouetted against a frosted glass illuminated from behind with a medium floodlight. A very narrow spotlight was situated 100 degrees from the camera to illuminate the drops being photographed. Most events were filmed at approximately 2.5 m with either a 90, 100 or 120 mm lens at framing rates of 500 frames/s to 4000 frames/s depending on the requirements of the interactions."
"Gevacolor Print Film, Type 9.85, is a conventionally designed color positive film with each of the three light-sensitive layers containing an appropriate dye coupler. Exceptional sharpness and excellent color saturation, achieved by very stringent selection of the various dye couplers, combined with extremely thin emulsion layers make the film especially suitable for small formats. Processing is based on a commercially available color developer which uses 2-amino-5-diethylaminotoluene monohydrochloride. This film can be processed together with other similar color print films using exactly the same processing methods, solutions and processing times without causing any contamination whatsoever."
"Removable jet-black backing, commonly referred to as rem jet, is coated on the support side of many color films to absorb any light that is not absorbed by the emulsion and support layers during the photographic exposure. Without rem jet, some light would be reflected at the support-air interface. This reflected light could expose additional silver halide in the emulsion, giving rise to halation. The backing also provides antistatic protection, some lubricity and some protection from scratches. Rem jet is a dispersion of carbon black in a polymeric binder, a dibasic half ester of cellulose acetate. On passing through solubilizing solutions at pH values above 8, the polymer becomes soluble in water and this property is utilized to remove the rem jet in processing. Also important is the suppression of solubility by a high concentration of salts. Backing removal includes submerging the film in an alkaline solution of high salt content, rinsing with water, and buffing away the remaining rem jet. Chemicals and water with few impurities must be used, and rem jet must be removed carefully and completely at the proper point in the process. A particular rem-jet-removal system that is in general use is discussed in detail because it has many necessary and desirable general characteristics. Several other proven rem-jet-removal systems are discussed briefly. A new approach to rem-jet-removal equipment is also discussed."
"The use of xanthan gum has been found superior to poly-(methyl vinyl ether/ maleic anhydride) in the Eastman soundtrack developer."
              "There are two basic types of technique for using electronic computers to produce movements and images for “animation.” The first computerizes the movements of the conventional animation stand; the other uses computer-generated pictures. The philosophies of these methods are discussed."
"Special animation languages have been developed for specifying an image sequence to be generated by a computer. Although this approach to computer animation has provided some form of organization and control of the specification of image sequences, the computer remains out of reach to most animators because of the communication difficulty. An animator's ideas involve mainly pictures and their motion. Thus it is appropriate that the communication of ideas between the animator and the computer should be largely through pictures. An interactive computer-controlled graphical system allows the animator to develop pictorial sequences directly on a cathode-ray tube display, without forcing the animator to become a computer programer. The implementation of computer-generated key-frame animation is based on techniques that have been developed for conventional cel animation. Key frames are created and stored on a suitable medium such as digital magnetic tape or disc. In addition to the picture, information about the kind of motion and the number of frames from the previous key frame is specified. During playback of this sequence, the in-between frames are computed by interpolating between key frames and are displayed at the cine rate on the cathode-ray display. Thus previewing is available in seconds."
"While increasing effort is being made to employ computers in the drawing of pictures, most attempts are confined to the use of existing digital computers which are generally expensive to acquire and difficult to program. In addition such machines are inherently unable to handle the extremely high data rates necessary for dynamic animation generation with the detail and quality required by a graphic artist. Specialized hybrid computers, designed specifically for artist use, permit the generation of complex animated materials directly at standard cine or TV frame rates. The resultant high-speed, high-quality response to the artist's demands makes the systems well suited to the production of entertainment, educational, commercial and training films and videotapes. The new computers permit the artist to work with familiar tools in a familiar way and yet they permit him instantaneous control of shape, motion and color in a way never before possible."
"The advent of super 8 created a number of nontechnical as well as technical problems. A number of decisions have been and are required to achieve a high-quality product and profitable operation. A review of the experiences of one laboratory and the reasons for its decisions are given."
"Using super-8 film for television news reporting is a possibility for the future because of the obvious advantages of ease of handling and reduction in film cost. This will offset the cost of retooling and buying new projection equipment. Improvements made in amateur super-8 cameras have preceded in many features the 16mm professional camera. If the demand for a super-8 camera for television use were made, manufacturers would develop one. The same is true of super-8 film stock for television. A super-8 camera now on the market produces a magnetic-striped sound film using a double-system sound recording technique; however, a single-system sound camera could be developed for TV news coverage. A survey of 400 news film operations in the U.S. showed that a significant percentage desired to explore super-8 film for news coverage."
"Photographic color film is an established and broadly standardized television program material having worldwide use in a variety of system equipment. Existing collections of color film motion-picture programs are very large and laboratory production services are generally available, rather than proprietary. Super-8 color film can be used in telecine equipment of the types available for the larger lGmm and 35mm film formats. The smaller format is also expected to stimulate color film videoplayer designs utilizing flying-spot scanning, cartridge- or cassette-loading convenience and thinner films. Factors influencing super-8 color film utilization in videoplayer applications include availability of small- or large-quantity print reproduction from larger format original films or printing intermediates, also the great variety of super-8 motion-picture photography in business, education and by the amateur movie maker."
"In a training program for medical personnel, a one-hour color film with optical sound is distributed in cartridges on a weekly basis. Though the ultimate aim is a one-hour program on a single 400-ft reel, a special printing stock with a total thickness of no more than 2.3 mils would be required to achieve that goal. At present two cartridges with 7-in reels are used. The original films are shot entirely on 35mm color negative film. From the edited negative a quad super-8 dupe-negative is produced. On a special optical-sound camera a quad sound negative is recorded in one run from a 17.5mm or 16mm magnetic tape. Both negatives are contact printed onto a color positive film of approximately 4-mil thickness with polyester basis. Factors affecting optical and sound quality are discussed."
"A number of variables are involved in super-8 printing and several types of printing and film handling equipment are required. To meet these requirements, the Geo. W. Colburn Laboratory designed and built specialized super-8 laboratory equipment. This special equipment is briefly described in this paper."
"There are basically two cartridge projection systems available — continuous-loop and reel-to-reel, usually combined with automatic rewinding of the film but requiring manual changing of the cartirdge. The Multimatic projection system has been designed to hold up to six 50-ft cartridges simultaneously, with automatic changing from one to another. This is accomplished with two takeup chambers and separate film channels for projection and rewinding. The cartridge is designed to hold super-8 film with the end of the film secured to the core for automatic rewinding. The first film is rewound while the second film is projected, so that the interval between projecting one film and another is about 4 s. Projection can be done at either 18 or 24 frames/s. A pushbutton changes the speed instantly to slow-motion of one-third of either speed and stop motion is provided."
"A methodology of film and sound presentation, using an inexpensive cartridge containing both photographic film and magnetic tape in continuous-loop format, is offered as a new presentation medium and a viable alternative to the electronic approach to the audiovisual market. The system is described and release-print costs are given which are significantly lower than costs from the conventional super-8, 16mm, or electronic release-print costs. As of February 1971, the system is in production."
"A high-speed contact duplicator, capable of making video copies from a standard master tape, using chromium dioxide (CrO2) has been developed. A computer program was prepared to investigate the basic characteristics of several thermal duplication systems employing CrO2 tape and laboratory equipment was built to show the feasibility of a dynamic thermal duplication system."
"Magnetic recordings may be copied from one Crolyn® chromium dioxide tape to another by a simple thermal method. Surface of the copy tape is heated transiently above the Curie point (125 °C) and immediately placed in intimate contact with the master tape. At the shortest wavelength, signal level of the copy is equal to that of the master, which suffers no loss in the copy process. Thermoremanent duplicators for helical-scan videotapes are described. No plans to manufacture the thermoremanent duplicators have been made but development of the machine is continuing to establish the complete validity of copying video recordings on Crolyn tape by the thermal method."
"Videotape recording from its introduction fifteen years ago has been widely accepted by the television industry, both as a production tool and a medium for distribution. The technology of videotape recording has advanced rapidly. From its inception, the capability to duplicate videotapes was an obvious requirement but until recently, machine-to-machine duplication (rerecording) in real time was the only practical solution; however, when a large number of copies is to be made, the process is extremely wasteful of time and equipment. If a single-reproduce machine is used to transfer to multiple-copy machines, a high degree of care must be taken to ensure uniformity of quality and interchangeability of the copies."
"Warren Smith (Celanese Corp., New York, N.Y.): In thermal duplicating, what is the relationship between the Curie temperature and the melting point on the coating or the backing?"
"In a Country where photography has become an important instrument in both scientific and lay endeavors, it would seem appropriate that the trend in photographic education would be toward a more comprehensive curriculum. During the Ninth International Congress on High-Speed Photography a seminar was held to discuss the educational requirements in photographic science and technology."
"The combination of the soft-touch tire and the spring-centered spool demand-drive system has provided the designer of film processing machines with a simple way of transporting film with excellent tension control and considerable flexibility in the way the processor can be used. This combination proved so simple and successful that it was soon not only being used for new machines but being utilized to convert existing machines with other film-transport systems. An example of such a conversion is described in detail as a guide to those who are contemplating the use of these innovations."
"Notice is hereby given that the Annual Meeting of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc., will be held at 1:30 p.m., local time, April 26, 1971, at the Century Plaza Hotel, Los Angeles."
 "This Program is the scheduling of papers within the sessions. It is as accurate and complete as possible. Before the Conference, however, papers may be removed or rearranged into other sessions.

           "Trends beginning, or predicted, in 1969 continued through 1970. One continuing trend is the growing number of small theaters and dual or triple theaters being constructed in the United States and in a number of European countries. The day of the large motion-picture theater seems to be about over. Some buildings house as many as four theaters of varying capacity under one roof. Some small theaters have experimented with a l6mm print in the interests of economy. Super-8 film preduction continued to expand and considerable emphasis was placed on standardization."
"From the Information Bulletin of UNIATEC (Union Internationale des Associations Techniques Cinématographiques), received at SMPTE Headquarters in January, this slightly abridged translation has been prepared as a report on this important organization and its 9th Congress."
"The National Broadcasting Company has about 600 Mitchell 16mm 400-ft film magazines assigned to about 150 Auricon converted cameras."
"In a recent Journal Paper,* Kolb) and Carr presented measurements of the flux vs frequeney on a number of 16mm magnetic-sound test films. In Sec. 6.2 of that paper, measurements by Morrison (STL) and an analysis by McKnight (Ampex) were also reported; these were preliminary measurements by STL which did not agree with those by Kolb and Carr, but were incorporated in the paper because of the pressure of the Journal publication schedule."
"The terms and definitions presented here were developed by the Nomenclature Subcommittee of the SMPTE Video Tape Recording Committee. The glossary sets forth the terms and definitions agreed to by the committee. Suggestions on deletions, additions and modifications should be sent to Alex E. Alden, Staff Engineer, Society Headquarters, as promptly as possible. The first group was published in the June 1970 issue of the Journal. Additional groups will be published as accord is reached."
"Plans for the Technical Papers Program are going forward with at least 70 or more papers expected from Canada and the United States with a good representation from other countries. Topics and Topic Chairmen will be announced by Leslie H. Holmes, Program Chairman, Canadian Broadcasting Corp., P.O. Box 8478, Ottawa, Ont. K1G 3J5, Canada, to appear in the June issue of the Journal."
             "In the development of 16mm magnetic recording, both as a stripe on motion-picture film and as a soundtrack on magnetic film, different techniques in frequency equalization have evolved and different proposals for standardization have been advanced. In practice the differences are observed to be such that rerecording is frequently necessary, and program interchangeability has been hampered. As an essential prerequisite to evaluation of the compromise proposals that have been advanced, a few representative test films have been examined in order to have actual data on how the existing standards are being interpreted, and how closely actual practice adheres to the applicable documents. The range of equalization curves measured on these 16mm test films is sufficiently large that a move toward an acceptable compromise is desirable. Inasmuch as efficient recording media in 16mm format are readily available and there is always the incentive to permit the best possible overall system performance, a 50-μs high frequency aim is proposed for efficient loading of the magnetic medium."
"Studies are reported of two systems for color reproduction: (1) a two-primary system with red and white primaries and (2) a three-primary red, white and blue system. Both systems were found to give a pleasant though pastel reproduction, with the red, white and blue system having a better color range, particularly at high luminance. In comparison with conventional red, green and blue systems, the white-primary systems offer improved reproduction of low-saturation hues, e.g., skin tones, with some sacrifice of color range."
"With advancing technology, the possibility of monitoring in real time the continuous changes in an x-ray diffraction pattern produced by dynamic events has drawn the interest of many investigators. Progress has been slow, largely because of strict limitations on available intensity and required resolution. Also, not only the apparatus but the technique of application to research must be developed in order to make the equipment compatible with rather specific scientific interests. One new system uses a very fine grained fluorescent screen to display the x-ray patterns as optical light images. Those images are transferred via standard lenses to a low noise, high gain optical image intensifier. The intensified image is then viewed from the rear of the image tube with a high-resolution vidicon and the final image displayed on a TV monitor. Time exposure photographs, commonly 12 seconds in duration, were made of the TV screen while the x-ray device scanned a 5-mm specimen. The most recent system also uses a low-noise, high-gain optical image intensifier, but the image tube is fiber optically coupled to the x-ray fluorescent screen increasing the sensitivity of the system by eliminating optical lens absorption. The theoretical resolution of this system is 35 1p/mm. Cine-recording of changing x-ray diffraction patterns during deformation has been achieved with this system."
"The recent development of zoom lenses owes much to advanced computer techniques, such as automatic lens design, and also to techniques for precise image evaluation. It is obvious, however, that because of lens configuration and materials which have been used, the development of lens systems will find the limit sooner or later. Several attempts have been made to find ways of overcoming the limit. At present, in the case of a zoom lens, the most effective way seems to be the use of artificial crystals, especially calcium fluoride, which is quite effective in reducing chromatic aberrations. The development of a zoom lens containing calcium fluoride elements has been made possible by the achievement of a production system to synthesize large blocks of artificial calcium fluoride at moderate cost."
"A new film gate photometer has been designed for the control of color printers. While doing away with the disadvantages of the sensitometric method of control, the new meter, with its series of probes, provides: (1) red, green, blue and “whitelight” irradiance (exposure) measurements directly at the film plane; (2) a check of the uniformity of the illumination across the film-gate area; and (3) monitors the illuminance at the printer eyepiece while it is in use. Photometric and photographic tests have indicated that the photometer is an excellent tool for complete control of color printers."
"Color release motion-picture prints in 35mm, 16mm and super-8 formats are being produced from 16mm originals. An evaluation is made of the image sharpness achieved in the prints, using both subjective testing and modulation transfer techniques. The sharpness of 35mm enlargements of 16mm Eastman Ektachrome Commercial Film 7252 originals made through 35mm internegatives is comparable to that obtained through conventional duplicate negative and reversal duplicate negative stages that start with 35mm color negatives. This enlargement from the 16mm reversal original is superior to enlargements of 16mm color negatives through the 35mm duplicating stages. Super-8 prints made with the current reversal original, internegative and print materials surpass the image quality attainable in 16mm prints made with the preceding generation of color films."
"During the Past Year, the SMPTE has increased by many times its direct participation in the international standardization of the motion-picture system. Today, in fact, nearly one-quarter of the activity and of the budget of the office of our Staff Engineer is directed toward supporting the USA-held Secretariat of Technical Committee TC-36, “Cinematography,” of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)."
"The US delegates to the Oslo meetings were W. R. Isom, RCA Corp., who worked in TC 60 and SC 60A (Sound Recording) and F. M. Remley, Jr., The University of Michigan, who worked in TC 60 and SC 60B. Approximately 40 delegates attended all or part of the meetings, with about 21 working in SC 60A and 19 working in SC 60B."
"The meeting was called to order by the President, as Chairman, at the conclusion of the Get-Together Luncheon. Since the Executive Secretary held 1207 signed proxies, a quorum was declared to be present in person and by proxy."
"Once Again the Color Committee Meeting was lively and vigorous due to extensive discussion of the color standards and references needed for the television industry."
                "Live television exchanges have increased considerably during the last 20 years, in spite of problems caused by the different television standards and the different ways in which the communications systems are organised in the world. The development of international television is reviewed and the methods used by the European Broadcasting Union for the organisation of international television transmissions are described."
"Accurate registration of the component images of a color television system is difficult to maintain over long periods. A comprehensive system of error detection and correction would divide the picture into a number of small areas to be dealt with separately. By means of scan perturbation it would then automatically reregister each area separately but the instrumentation of such a system would be complicated. An investigation into the performance of existing cameras showed that acceptably good registration can be achieved in continuous operation by the automatic control of only the image centering. A simple error detector, which operates upon picture information, together with a control system which varies the shift currents, has been devised."
"The Photoconductive Effect was discovered in selenium in 18731 but it was not until 1950 that a photoconductive camera tube — the vidicon — was announced. The photoemissive effect on the other hand, discovered about 1890,2 was incorporated in a practical camera tube about 1930. The reason for this difference in the rate of development is easy to understand because, in spite of the basically higher quantum efficiency of photoconductors, it proved very difficult to control their other properties for television applications."
"A new light valve television projection system has been designed incorporating a novel, deformable, reflective target consisting of a thin (∼2000–6000 Å) metal film supported in close proximity (∼5 μ) to a glass substrate. In operation a video-modulated electron beam scans the target and deforms the metal film analogously to the intensity of the video signal. These deformations control the amount of light from the schlieren projector that falls on the screen. The mechanical and electrical performance of the deformable targets and operation of a specially designed off-axis, reflective schlieren projector are discussed. Display results for the total system are presented."
"The primary load-carrying member in many structures, particularly in the aerospace industry, is the Cylindrical shell. In the design of these shells, buckling load calculations play a major role in determining the load-carrying capacity of the structure under compressive loading. To perform an analysis experimentally, high-speed framing photography is used. A combined theoretical and experimental program was undertaken to investigate the behavior of photoelastic cylindrical shells of circular and elliptical cross-section subjected to static and dynamic axial loading. By recording the change in the photoelastic isoclinic patterns (which characterize the collapse modes of the cylinders) at framing rates up to 5000 pictures/s using a 16mm Hycam camera, a comparbon of these patterns with theory was possible. Theoretical and experimental results clearly demonstrate the variation in collapse modes of cylinders as a function of their cross-section, shape imperfections and rate of axial loading."
"A wide dynamic range photometer has been designed with a photomultiplier operated at constant anode current by means of a feedback circuit. The output of the photometer is accurately proportional to the logarithm of light intensity over a range as great as eight decades. The internal feedback loop is stable, with a unity-gain bandwidth up to 100 kHz, depending on the photomultiplier type and anode current. Day-long stability is better than 1% or 0.004 log units. The photometer is being used in a photographic film scanning microdensitometer."
"A crystal-controlled cordless universal motor has been developed to be compatible with the Nagra tape recorder, and to streamline camera equipment. A temperature-compensated crystal or tuning fork is used as a stable oscillator. The motor uses a highly efficient dc motor which operates in phase lock reference with a crystal source. Total system efficiency runs as high as 70%. The camera drive provides increased flexibility of movement of the camera. The absence of drive gearing, the use of sealed permanently lubricated bearings and all solid-state circuitry make this motor an extremely reliable, long-life device."
"The table herewith will augment the information detailed in Table I of the Progress Committee Report for 1970 (Journal, p. 373, May 1971). Under the heading “No. of transmitters” in Table I the figure in parentheses refers to these operating on the transmission system which is identified by the letter similarly enclosed in the preceding column. This new information lists the principal characteristics of broadcast television signals as tabulated by the C.C.I.R. (C.C.I.R. Report 308, Tenth Plenary Assembly, Geneva, 1963). The field repetition frequency is 50/s for all stations listed."
"The Annual Winter Television Conference was held on January 22 and 23, 1971, at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Video Magnetic Recording was the theme, and the four sessions centering around this topic were: Helical-Scan and Disc Recorders, Quadruplex Recorders, High-speed Duplication of Videotape and Color Cameras for Broadcast and Other New Developments."
"A Two-Day tutorial seminar on continuous-film processing, sponsored jointly by the SMPTE and the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers, was held first in Los Angeles in November 1970 and again in New York in March 1971. Plans are underway to hold the Tutorial Seminar on Technologies in the Laboratory Handling of Motion Picture and Other Long Films for a third time — in Chicago. An impressive number of interested people attended each seminar. There were more than 120 registrants at Los Angeles and more than 130 at New York. Among the registrants were supervisory laboratory personnel, technicians from optical houses, university people, personnel from Army and Navy installations and many others from important motion-picture and television activities."

    "The development of a new screen material by 3M (Scotchlite 7610) has made possible the Front Projection Process, in which those portions of the projected image falling upon the actors are not visible, and shadows cast upon the screen by actors and foreground objects are not seen by the camera. The beaded Scotchlite screen is a reflex reflector, returning most of the reflected light back to its source. Gain is sufficient for one footcandle of background image intensity to balance a 200-fc foreground illumination. The very low illumination required by the Scotchlite screen makes possible background screens as large as 30,000 ft2 when using an arc projector. The practical use of front projection requires careful alignment of the camera and projector lenses to superimpose their front nodal points. The paper provides tables that define a safe minimum object distance as a function of screen distance, lens focal length and ƒ/stop. Panning and tilting of the camera to follow action is permissible in front projection if the front nodal points are carefully aligned. By observing the limitations of the front-projection process, excellent results have been obtained. The paper explains these limitations and provides an operations check list."
"Aspects of the development and application of high-speed raster cameras as well as the prospects for future development are presented in this review. A comparison is made with other high-speed cameras including those using image-converter tubes."
"The research and development of a new laser TV film recording system is described, which satisfies the needs of quality color TV broadcast film-distribution functions. In the past, direct color TV recording has been limited to the 3-kine-scope, or “trinescope,” recorder, and photography from a shadow-mask color CRT. Other techniques utilize the encoding of the color information into a pattern which is subsequently retrieved in a special playback instrument. The new direct color laser film recording system described in this paper uses conventional color motion-picture film, processing and projection equipment. It provides high resolution, high color purity, low noise, low optical flare, wide dynamic range, excellent scan linearity and perfect color registration throughout the picture. Major design considerations, such as film and laser selection, optical and scanner design, and circuit and control system design, are covered. The main ingredients of this new system are the availability of adequate laser power to overcome optical losses and the utilization of precision light-scanning techniques to apply selected laser colors on compatible film emulsions. Careful electronic control of these factors provides a significant advance in the quality of color-film transfer from NTSC signals."
"SMPTE President Wilton R. Holm invited a number of outstanding personalities of the industry and the press for a panel discussion on “Commercial Satellites and America's Future Communications Network.”"
"An analysis of the distortion contributed by RF predetection filtering in the transmission of a frequency modulated signal has been performed. Test signals of two types were employed in the analysis, namely, single and multiple sinusoidal test tones. This combination of signals was used to provide a repeatable, tractable signal model, useful for characterizing video transmission in a band-limited communications link. Two RF predetection filter characteristics, the Bessel and the Butterworth, were analyzed by computer-aided techniques. Plots of single and multiple test tone distortion were generated for a variety of vital link parameters, including modulation index, bandwidth/baseband ratio, and filter center frequency/bandwidth ratio for the two filter characteristics. The analysis is summarized in this paper, in terms of these variables, for single tone only."
"The first network newsfilm use of super-8 film took place in November 1965. Since then National Broadcasting Co. has tested and evaluated equipments with a view toward establishing a complete super-8 newsfilm system. A double-system sound camera, processing, editing and TV projection system has been installed for further testing and evaluation. Single system has also been evaluated. Results of the tests at NBC through April 1971 are reported."
"In the motion-picture industry difficulty has been encountered in transferring magnetic sound to super-8 prestriped film. Either of two film “configurations” has been used. The first, or “A,” configuration is a direct carryover from the tape industry. The second, or “C,” configuration was used in the high-speed magnetic sound printer described in 1966.2 A similar technique is used on some magnetic sound projectors. Because of the difficulties encountered, a comprehensive study was undertaken to analyze the effects of the various operational parameters of both methods of recording. Studied were: (1) physical film condition, (2) film path configuration, (3) head pressure, (4) head design and (5) film guiding. It was conclusively demonstrated that the film path configuration is of primary consideration. The “C” or “on-the-drum” recordings provide the best assurance of quality sound transfer whether to raw or processed film. With this configuration the importance of the other variables is reduced."
"Beginning students at the University of California, Los Angeles must produce a double-system sound film using super 8. For convenience in editing and interlocking with 16mm magnetic film, a projection rate of 24 frames/s has been made standard. In the fall of 1970, a new super 8/16mm mixing system which used a single-phase 117-V sync-interlock drive was installed. All films are screened in a 280-seat theater. It was necessay to provide projection equipment which would give image size and brightness adequate for viewing in a theatrical situation. A number of specialized design considerations had to be implemented so that the system could be operated by nontechnically oriented students."
"Personal projectors, which can be loaded with cartridges, are cordless, provide viewing in room light and are low in cost; they make possible self-study at the student's own pace. A new one-to-one learning system recognizes that one teaching medium should be dominant, i.e., print, with the visual-audio element feeding into the printed text in short bits as required to illustrate a point. These visuals would be single frames, silent filmstrips, sound/slide sequences and chunks of sound movies used as though the visuals were printed on a textbook page, and running only the few seconds or a minute or two needed to clarify a particular point. The various visuals are cartridges on a single reel and are arranged in the progression required by the printed text so that the appropriate visual is continually available to the student."
"It has been well recognized for years that lubrication of processed motion-picture film is extremely important for projection performance. The advent of sprocketless projectors in the amateur movie market has greatly intensified this need. Nevertheless, experience has shown that some processed films are not effectively lubricated. Therefore, there is a need for a simple and reliable test for lubrication and an instrument has been devised to fill this need. It is basically an inclined plane friction test in which a special slider takes the place of the usual sled. The rounded end of the paper clip, bearing on the test film, furnishes the only support for the slider. The paper clip is balanced in a vertical position, since the entire slider's center of gravity is well below the bearing point. In this study, the paper clip friction and projector performance of two different super-8 films are evaluated at several levels of lubrication."
"I should like to make a few comments concerning the report of the Videotape Recording Panel Discussion as published in the December 1970 issue of the Journal."
"The Sixth Annual SMPTE Winter Television Conference will be held in Dallas on February 4 and 5 at the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel, according to an announcement by SMPTE's Television Affairs Vice-President, K. Blair Benson. The program is arranged with the cooperation of R. E. Putnam, SMPTE Editorial Vice-President."
  "This Program is the scheduling of papers within the sessions. It is as accurate and complete as possible. Before the Conference, however, papers may be removed or rearranged into other sessions. The sessions are firm. Questions about specific papers or sessions should be addressed to Society Headquarters, Att: 110th Conference-Elaine Itzkowitz, (212) 867-5410; Program Chairman Leslie H.

The synopses booklet will be available at the Conference, and later from Society Headquarters."
       "What we are going to discuss here today, has been called a new technology. Basically it involves a video-player, which may also be a video recorder, and which, when connected to the antenna terminals of a television monitor, or receiver, will reproduce, with sound, a prerecorded video program. The TV set is common to all systems which have been proposed. But the video-players of the various prospective systems involve not one, but several technologies. It would seem prudent then, that right at the beginning of our symposium we define “technology” and make some basic observations about technologies in a socio-economic context."
"I wanted to start by speaking in French because we are in Montreal, and because I owe a debt to the program, as it is printed in French. Bi-lingualism fascinates me, and so I read the French as well as the English versions of my talk as it's given in this short form brochure that not all of you have. And I was struck by the difference, because in the English version, they speak of video cassettes as new medium; and in the French version it says video cassettes, 5 new medium."
"In order to set the analysis that follows in perspective, let us divide the field of video cassettes, etc., into three classes: the prerecorded sort of thing that emulates today's phonograph and audio cassette business, the “do-it-yourself” kind of business that is typified by the Port-a-Pac video-tape recorder and resembles the present day audio tape recorder, and finally an electronic delivery system."
"Hardly a day goes by that we don't see press releases announcing the emergence – for 1971, 1972 or 1973 – of the “X-record” or “Y-vision” with a statement of the price or of the location of program supply, or of news of agreements reached with certain groups on certain processes outlining the rights on certain full-length films."
"Although we have had television for many years now, it is interesting to note that video cassettes for home use were developed only recently. There is good reason for this: the technical process for the storage of the visual image is much more complicated compared to that of sound. Therefore, more time was required for the development of the video storage means, i.e., the equivalent systems to the audio disc and tape. To be fair, there was one reasonably cheap system of picture storage in existence in the early days of television; that was the 8mm amateur film. Furthermore, this known medium also has gained considerable importance in the last few years by the introduction of television to the audio-visual business. So, one could generally say that the introduction of television techniques is the novel feature which caused the recent boom in the discussions about audio-visual developments."
"The first part of this paper reviews briefly the principles of contact duplication which were reported in several previous papers.1,2,3 These principles are applicable to all types of recordings regardless of tape format, quadruplex or helical. The second part discusses those problems which are particularly important when duplicating helical recordings."
"In the past it has become common practice in commercial application of video playback systems to utilize video monitors that were especially designed to accept the video signals of a particular playback system. This enabled the designer to optimize both the video player and monitor for most practical and economical results. The necessary interconnections usually consisted of video and audio cables which made it very convenient to operate and set up the video playback system. However, when one considers the use of home television receivers as a means for monitoring the output signals of video players, the compatability of the signal with those receivers has to be kept in mind."
"At the recent EBU colloquium at London, Dr. Zaccarian concluded his report on video recorders and players, intended for the general public's use, with these words: “The only characteristic common to all these systems is that there is none.”"
"With your permission, I shall begin by extending to you the greetings and best wishes of Jean-Paul L'Allier, Minister of Communications, who is most happy to see you holding your annual meeting in Quçbec just when you have decided to study so vital a topic as new video equipment. Quçbec is keenly interested in these instruments of technical progress and this will be the subject of my talk. Indeed, Mr. L'Allier and the entire Department of Communications are eagerly looking forward to the results of your symposium discussions."
"In the Middle Ages, a young man who wished to become a doctor of medicine, was able to select his own teachers. Having heard for instance, of the reputation of a famous surgeon, say in Padua, he went there and served an apprenticeship until he had learned all that doctor could teach him. Then he travelled on to the next authority, making his selection according to what he felt was necessary to make him a good practitioner. (Fig. 1)"
"Current cable television functions are centered on the “community antenna” concept. Cable systems receive television broadcast stations at either remote or local antenna sites and feed these broadcast television channels to paying subscribers. Some cable systems are originating some programs and program origination on cable systems is receiving increasing attention from the cable television industry and regulatory agencies. Some consideration is being given to the use of cable system facilities for generalized communications functions, some of which include the transmission of visual information."
"For several years the subject of video player systems and their applications has been receiving a rising crescendo of attention from all quarters. Their potential as a new industry, their threat to existing industries, and the societal changes with which their introduction coincide give this new medium a special fascination. Our discussion focuses on industrial applications of video player systems, and includes observations on the questions of the potential in industry of these systems, their threat to existing products such as 16 millimeter films, and some of the ways in which their use relates to changes currently occurring in industry as well as the rest of society."
"When I was asked to talk about Home Utilization of Cassettes, I told However, we also have in the home several tests of cassette your Chairman that we had cassettes in use in the home today. We do – exactly six! However, we also have in the home several tests of cassette programing on videotape recorders and other technical devices that will be transferred to cassettes – some next week and more every week thereafter – until we are in several hundred homes by the end of next year."
"It has been almost ten years since the video tape recorders were brought into use widely in the non-broadcasting industry. There are many types of applications of VTR's and as manufacturers of such VTR's, we have spent much time in considering a cassette type of video tape recorder as opposed to a reel-to-reel type. There is no doubt that a cassette is much easier to handle than an open reel. However, we have reached the conclusion that we must research and develop the VIDEOCASSETTE as a new total system of audio-visual communications, rather than a mere modification of existing VTR's. The reason being the following. Considering the operation of current slant-track VTR's, handling of the tape is the most burdensome area, not only regarding its threading on the recorders, but also touching the tape by finger contact is the cause of many problems. By eliminating tape handling, the cassette is most effective in playback operations. In the recording operation, the operator must provide a signal to be recorded, either from live cameras or other sources. The operator must be aware of technical factors of the program to be recorded. Even in recording an off-the-air signal, adjustment of the tuner is critical for good results. On the other hand, a VIDEOCASSETTE has a possibility of being capably handled by anyone with average knowledge, if the operation is limited to the reproduction of previously recorded information. Exploring the state-of-the-art of slant-track low-cost VTR's. we find that there is a large market of such application where a program has been recorded, dubbed to a number of cassettes, distributed ad then reproduced by those who want to view the program at a convenient time. In such cases where recording and reproduction can be separated, more complex recording techniques can be introduced in the recording operation if it is effective to simplify the operation of playback. The SONY Color VIDEOCASSETTE Total System has been based on these considerations."
"No subject in recent memory has had as much discussion or aroused as much interest as the much-ballyhooed arrival of the video cassette. If it has done nothing else, the fanfare and publicity have served as a stimulus for many people to consider their visual communications requirements, and to examine what applications they might have for the video cassette when it arrives. The result has been a beneficial one, in that many potential applications have been uncovered, and some long-dormant ones have been dusted off and re-examined."
"In a separate paper published above Eric Yavitz of Kodak's Motion Picture and Education Markets Division presented a story (Fig. 1) of the value of motion pictures in scanning systems which generate sound and picture information in a form ready to be fed into a standard home television receiver or into a telecasting system for reception by standard TV monitors. Mr. Yavitz also pointed out that film generated for this purpose is completely compatible for use in optical projection onto conventional reflection screens or onto rear projection screens, such as those found in education, etc."
"In June 1970, the three companies AEG-TELEFUNKEN, DECCA and TELDEC, a subsidiary of AEG-TELEFUNKEN and DECCA, presented the world's first Video Disc for monochrome recording in Berlin. About one year later in August 1971, a color version of the Video Disc was demonstrated in Germany. The recording and play back process of the Video Disc requires the combination of luminance, color and audio information into a single signal which has been achieved by a new color video recording technique. Before describing this process the specifications and features of the disc and the player for the 625-line television standard should be summarized [1]."

"The general information in this Guide is applicable to all forms of outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear. Specific data are given for outdoor metal-clad switchgear. The many combinations of sizes and ratings in similar housings make it impracticable to provide equivalent information for outdoor low-voltage metal-enclosed air circuit-breaker switchgear. Data are not yet available for specific recommendations for other switchgear equipment or components."
"This document represents a revision of material contained in the previous edition of IEEE Standard No. 172 (54 IRE 12.S1) and IEEE Standard No. 174.

"This standard specifies the \"weighted peak\" method of measurement for predicting subjective flutter of sound recorders and reproducers for normal audio usage. For special purposes - high speed duplicators, different speeds in recording and reproducing, etc - special procedures not described here must be used."
"Many definitions in this standard are applicable to devices other than electron tubes especially semiconductor devices. These definitions have been made as general as possible, but it should always be remembered, in interpreting these definitions that they are primarily written for electron tubes. IEEE Std 161-1971, consists of IEEE Std 160-1957 as revised in part by the clarified definitions of \"noise factor\" and \"noise temperature\" in IEEE Std 161-1962."
"This standard sets forth the requirements for installation, inspection, and testing of Class I and Class IE electric power, instrumentation, and control equipment and systems during the construction phase of a nuclear power generating station. These requirements are intended to assure that only materials and equipment of acceptable quality are incorporated into the plant, that quality is maintained and quality workmanship prevails throughout the construction process, and that completed installations conform to specified requirements, so as to promote public safety, prevent accidents and mitigate the consequences of accidents if they occur, and provide a high degree of plant reliability."
"The purpose of this standard is to describe a practical method for measuring the transmission characteristics of a telephone set by means of objective measurements in a test connection. The test results thus obtained may be used as a means of evaluating or specifying the transmission performance of a telephone on a standardized basis. The basic accuracy and reproducibility of measurements made in accordance with this standard will depend primarily upon the accuracy of the test equipment used, the care with which the measurements are conducted, and the inherent stability of the telephone and/or transducers under test. Where a given set of measurements is repeated in the same laboratory and by the same operator, a relatively high degree of reproducibility should normally be obtained. However, when comparing measurements made by different laboratories, allowances must be made for the influencing factors mentioned above."
"This guide describes several methods of measurement for the small signal characterization of varactors. For the purpose of this guide, a varactor is defined as a twoterminal device used as a voltage-dependent capacitance. Such devices can be used from dc to microwave frequencies. Examples include low noise parametric amplifiers from audio to microwave frequencies, tuning elements, choppers, and phase shifters. A small-signal equivalent circuit is presented and its validity discussed. Methods for determining the elements of this circuit by means of ac measurements are described in general terms, and restrictions are discussed. The use of dc measurement techniques is discussed in Test Procedure for Semiconductor Diodes IEEE 256. For a consideration of noise measurements, see Part 9: Noise in Linear Twoports, Methods of Testing Electron Tubes - IEEE 158."
"This American National Standard is a revision and expansion of USA Standard Graphic Symbols forElectrical and Electronics Diagrams, Y32.2-1967.A large number of new symbols has been added. While the major additions are in the areas ofantennas, transmission path, thermal relays, VHF/UHF/SHF circuit devices, and semiconductor devices, all sections have some new or revised items. New sections have been added to cover graphic symbols for special-purpose maintenance diagrams, analog computer symbols (formerly in IEEE Standard166), also equipment and station symbols for system diagrams, maps and charts. For convenienceof users, the class letters used to form reference designations (formerly in ANSI Y32.16) have nowbeen included in a new section of Y32.2. In this revision the symbols are slightly larger than in Y32.2-1967 edition, resulting in improved readability. A revised edition of the large symbol chart included with the Y32.2-1967 edition will be available separately to complement the new edition.All of the symbols are designed so that their connection points fall on a modular grid. This shouldhelp those who use a grid basis for the preparation of diagrams. By proper enlargement of the symbolthe usual coordinate-grid sizes can be matched."
"This standard covers the application guide for transient recovery voltage requirements for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 volts and on a symmetrical current basis. The capability limits of these circuit breaker interrupting devices are determined largely by the transient recovery voltages. The guide for application is not included in other existing circuit breaker standards."
"This Recommended Practice gives rules for the use of units of the International System of Units and for forming and selecting decimal multiples and submultiples of the SI units for application in the various fields of technology."
"Germanium detectors are extensively used for the detection and analysis of gamma-radiation primarily because of their excellent energy resolution. The rapid development and utilization of these detectors in a variety of technical disciplines have made standard test procedures desirable so that measurements may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users.These test procedures are not intended to imply that all tests described herein are mandatory,but only that such tests as are carried out on completed devices should be performed in accordance with these recommended procedures. These test procedures are a supplement to the following documents: IEEE Std 300-1969, Test Procedure for Semiconductor Radiation Detectors, (ANSI N42.1-1969) and IEEE Std 301-1969, Test Procedure for Amplifiers and Preamplifiers for Semiconductor Radiation Detectors, (ANSI N42.2-1969)."

"The work described here was carried out over several veal's. It resulted in the development of a Class F (155 °C) insulation system, as well as gained fundamental knowledge of turn insulation capabilities. The simulated service test described here was a basic part of this program and established itself as an outstanding tool for determining system performance. The detailed conclusions of this work were: 1. Bond strength of the insulation systems or their binders to copper was established as a means of estimating the systems' simulated service test performance. 2. The epoxy resins tested, with their high copper bond strength and compression resistance, proved to be excellent binders for rotor turn insulation and improvements over the phenolics, and polyesters tested."
"Although it has been in use for many years, high frequency testing to establish the integrity of coil insulation remains superior to any other known technique. The use of solid-state switching devices to replace the spark gap used by Rylander, and the use of an oscilloscope display in place of his wavemeter have improved considerably the accuracy and reproducibility of the test, and made it more simple and fast. In addition, the procedure of discharging into two parallel coils and displaying the differential current signal has increased the sensitivity of the test. Because it is easily wheeled from place to place, this tester provides a degree of flexibility not available heretofore. For these reasons, the use of this type of apparatus for coil testing should increase markedly in the near future."
"As stated in the above, the non-destructive test with solventless coil having been kept in operation for approximately 10 years showed some changes in the electrical properties, but the breakdown voltage remained unchanged. When the electrical properties of solventless coil was compared with those of asphalt coil obtained form the literature, the solventless coil was proved to be thermally stable, less hydroscopic, its electrical properties being less affected by aging. In the recent coils, the impregnated resin and the mica tape have been improved, permitting one to expect more stable performance."
"All aspects of a micaceous insulation system should be considered when determining its usefulness as a mechanical and dielectric barrier. The insulation must be suitable for application to the coil, impregnated with a resin to make the system void free (except for B-stage tape); must exhibit low tan Ii and high dielectric strength as well as good corona resistance; and must withstand the service conditions of coil insertion, vibration, thermal and moisture cycling. In this study we have been primarily concerned with the electrical-chemical compatibility aspects of systems evaluations."
"Machine taped coils insulated with a Resin Rich B Stage glass backed mica paper tape have now been in production for a number of years. This process allows all the main wall insulation to be applied and consolidated in one application to all types of coils without any vacuum treatment. The system can be used at Class F temperatures. No voltage restriction has been made and the production processes have been developed for use up to 30 kV."
"Manufacturers must continually investigate new materials to stay competitive. Users must load transformers to their thermal limit in order to realize operating economies. The test procedures and loading guides discussed in this paper offer means by which both can affect substantial savings. Soon the proposed test procedures will receive official “IEEE Standards” designation. It is urged that all manufacturers and users support this standard, and the loading guide C57.91, so that we may work on a common basis understood and accepted by all concerned."
"This paper describes the method of applying overhead distribution transformers (167 kVA and smaller) which is employed by Southern California Edison Company. The method is based upon a program which involves a thorough and extensive investigation into the thermal and economic limits of distribution transformer loading. This application method is factored into (1) the bid analysis, including cost of losses, (2) the selection of transformer sizes for initial installation, and (3) maximum allowable loads for removal of transformers from service. The paper describes in detail the results of these investigations and on what basis the program was formulated."
"The 60 Hertz and impulse electrical strength of oil impregnated polyamide paper is as good as that of high quality electrical grade kraft paper and better than that of rope-kraft paper used as conductor insulated. The 60 Hertz dissipation factor of polyamide paper in oil increases moderately with increasing temperature. Based on burst strength and tensile strength retention, the thermal stability of the polyamide paper is substantially superior to that of cellulosic paper when aged in oil or askarel at 150°C and 175°C. Polyamide paper showed little or no degradation after extended life tests in distribution transformers. Polyamide paper with its superior mechanical properties can better withstand manufacturing operations in production than can cellulosic papers. Based on life test results the polyamide paper will permit the design of transformers with higher operating temperatures and greater overload capacities than can be obtained using cellulosic paper."
"During the past 8 years, mica has lost ground in its usage growth as compared to the total electrical insulation market. However, this loss has not been to materials that have superior electrical insulating properties but rather in applications which did not need the properties of mica. There is no product on the market that has the voltage endurance and corona resistance of mica. Combine these properties with the high temperatures and capability and superior dielectric strength of mica and for real heavy duty applications mica is the preferred insulation."
"Saturated CyGEs resins cured with hexahydrophthalic anhydride in the stoichiometric combining ratio of 1-1 expoxide:anhydride groups provide outstanding tracking resistance and weatherability. Polymeric CyGEs resins (semi-solid and hard resin versions) impart good thermal shock resistance to filled encapsulating compounds while retaining the excellent tracking resistance and weatherability of the liquid glycidyl esters. Polymeric CyGEs hard resins can be formulated into non-tracking molding compounds capable of producing finished parts on 3-minute press cycles. Variations in filler types and combinations, including incorporation of fibrous reinforcements, should be explored to optimize these molding compounds. Performance tests conducted on molded transformer bushings, standoff insulators and other finished parts will be required to better assess this CyGE's molding approach to replacing ceramic insulation"
"Since solid dielectrics must be used in all electrical systems, ways and means must be secured to complement their shortcomings, particularly against gaseous ionization. With composites where high quality insulating liquids as generally used, particular care must be taken to eliminate voids which can cause ionization. Uniformity in a volume of dielectrics is essential to reduce high electrical stress in isolated spots which can easily lead to electrical failure. Exotic new dielectrics may seem solutions to high stress electrical insulation problems, but their use has not commanded high degree of satisfaction and means must be provided to eliminate their shortcomings. Since the presence of weak spots is usually the cause of failure, successive low vacuum-high pressure impregnation to eliminate voids seems the hest solution."
"We hope we have made it clear that, because of the variables involved in obtaining TGA data, the need for standard procedures in operation and interpretation is necessary."
"This improvement in thermal stability is achieved with a new vinyl ester resin priced in the range of high temperature polyesters of the bisphenol A type. The ease of processing characteristic of vinyl esters has not been sacrificed. In the future we will see even more novel and useful properties being “built” into vinyl ester resins."
"Silicone resins are available capable of bridging the gap between encapsulants and rigid molding compounds for use where excellent electrical properties and resistance to thermal degradation are a design requirement. We expect the new materials to find broad application in the electronics industry in the near future as reliability and environmental protection become increasingly important in the design of electronic packaging."
"Silicone rubber offers advantages important in the selection of insulation for use during normal service in nuclear-powered generating stations-freedom of installation over a wide temperature range, low maintenance costs and safety during overloads and short circuits. Unique ashing characteristics during prolonged exposure to fire plus resistance to radiation and steam make silicone rubber the most reliable insulation under potential accident conditions. The forced shutdown of a generating station could result in high costs for replacement energy. The higher cost for silicone cables could disappear in a very few days. A continuation of present pricing trends combined with positive action in the area of cable design and specifications could greatly reduce cost differentials at some future date."
"During the last few years, several developments have aroused great interest in the electrical industry. Two of the most important are: (1) the increasing price of copper; and (2) the development of new aluminum alloys for wire. A quick comparison of costs of aluminum and copper ingot or redraw rod since 1940 (Figure 1) clearly shows the economic reasons for replacing copper with aluminum in conductor applications. Even though there have been fluctuations, the cost advantage of aluminum is apparent."
"Two things triggered the study of mechanical crimp connecting of magnet wires for use in our hermetic motors: (1) the economic possibilities of using aluminum magnet wires; and (2) the possible improvements in cost and reliability of copper wire connections."
"Two new concepts for constructing insulation piercing connectors for magnet wires have been discussed. The arched blade principle used In the self-riveting connector causes the blades to slide and dig deep into the conductor to make a gas-tight connection. The pyramid-shaped teeth on the cutting tooth connector bite deeply Into the conductor metal to form electrically sound could welding between the conductor and connector."
"The anodic processing of aluminum interconnect patterns provides a method of rendering aluminum interconnect compatible with non hermetic packaging. The presence of the barrier layer at the aluminum surface acts to greatly enhance the corrosion resistance of aluminum metal. The reliability of such interconnects on plastic encapsulated integrated circuits has been demonstrated. An evaluation of the dielectric properties of the anodic oxide of aluminum indicate properties which are compatible with single and multilevel interconnects for integrated circuits."
"Approaches to providing reliable semiconductor devices in non-hermetic packages has been reviewed and several conclusions are evident. First, the thermal silicon dioxide which is required for stable and controllable device characteristics must be protected by an outer, dense dielectric. Fortunately, both phosphor-silicate glass and silicon nitride are available for this purpose, and these are being used successfully."
"The USES High-ReI hermetic metallized plastic package offers distinct advantages over the conventional transfer molded package. The key points of merit have been covered in detail and are listed below."
"When a potential difference is established between the terminals of an insulator Joulean heat is produced in the insulator surface conductance and to a much lesser extent in the body conductance. As this heat dissipates to the surrounding~ the insulator surface temperature is everywhere raised above the ambient. The surface temperatures which result are never uniform but are determined by the atmospheric humidity, the distribution of surface contamination, the thermal properties of the insulator and the surrounding medium and on the complex means of heat dissipation. The hotter areas of surface are less prone to condensation and therefore tend to have a lower surface conductivity. The voltage distribution over an insulator surface depends in the absence of a surface conducting layer, on the shape of the electrostatic field and this in turn depends on the shape of the insulator. If an insulator can be so shaped that the voltage between its terminals is uniformly distributed over its surface then the breakdown voltage is probably equal to that of the air path between its terminals provided that the surface has no re-entrant curves. A surface conducting layer on an insulator modifies the voltage distribution over the surface. In practice, in a humid atmosphere, this tends to move the areas of highest voltage gradient towards the hottest areas on the surface. Due to heat transfer from the line conductor, the lower insulator unit of a string is normally at a slightly higher temperature than the remainder of the string. In humid atmosphere conditions this worsens the normal mal-distribution over the string. If the whole surface of an insulator is maintained at a temperature substantially above the atmospheric, condensation, in humid atmospheric conditions is prevented and contamination discouraged. Such insulators should in fact have the voltage distribution determined only by capacitance distribution. This voltage distribution is amenable to discipline at the design stage. Considerable waste heat is normally available from a line conductor. Using suitable heat exchangers some of this waste heat may be transferred to a hollow long rod type insulator. A 2-metre length of conductor was found to give an adequate temperature rise to the insulator which supported it."
"In the past, the approach to solving the complex problem of plastic encapsulation for microelectronic devices has been one of trial and error. The semiconductor industry was relatively an infant industry and as such it addressed itself more toward solving the problems of design and fabrication of the active element than to the encapsulant. At the same time, the material supplier has been kept busy attempting to solve the rapidly changing requirements for moisture protection, temperature cycling and thermal stability in the materials. The semiconductor industry has now matured to the point that requirements have been well defined for the present and the future."
"In electric power transmission, there is a trend towards higher operating voltages and more severe service conditions for outdoor insulators. Historically, higher voltages have called for bigger, heavier insulators, with larger support structures to carry the increased weight. Now, for economic reasons, there is an urgent need to reduce weight and size in insulators and support structures. Considerable research and development effort is being spent to synthesize and evaluate stronger, lighter-weight insulating materials. Test methods used to screen and evaluate new insulating materials have been based mainly on the outdoor, high voltage experience gained with porcelain insulators. These test methods are attempts to re-create-on a laboratory, accelerated scale-the actual problems which occur on porcelain in outdoor service conditions. These outdoor service problems have steadily increased during recent years, caused by the combination of higher operating voltages and increased industrial pollution."
"Liquid injection molding with thermosetting silicone elastomers offers the following advantages: 1. High speed encapsulation yielding higher production rates, lower unit cost and increased profits 2. Low capital expenditure for evaluation of the process and the molds 3. Excellent dielectric, physical, and thermal properties to provide stabilization for the device even when exposed to adverse conditions."
"A technique has been described as a possible tool in investigating the parameters which influence surface flashover. The technique has not as yet been fully evaluated, however, from initial observations, it appears to be very promising in contributing to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in surface flashover in liquids, a problem of great engineering importance."
"Although we were unable to accomplish the major objective of this study, e.g., define the voltage rating of a metalized polyester film capacitor by observing the effect of voltage and time on C, DF and IR, we believe in the light of our findings several significant conclusions can be drawn."
"The “factory in the sky” has several distinct advantages.1. An unobstructed area (no columns). 2. Adequate capacity for the production of half coils with maximum flexibility. Expansion of capacity or changes inprocessing may be accomplished with a minimum of further investment. 3. Equipment designed to manufacture half coils for machines in the 70's with ratings of at least 1,500 MVA for 2 pole and 2.500 MVA for 4 pole generators. 4. Storage and shipment of coils, by elevator, directly to the Generator Winding Aisle."
"Liquid Epoxy is now being specified for production parts. These parts are being tooled for manufacture on standard encapsulating presses, using standard press feeding equipment (TTPI and TTP2)."
"In 1963, an agreement in Europe (EEC and EFTA) was reached to designate output ratings to frame sizes as they are specified in IEC publication 72-1 and 72-2. With the 1963 document, the important motor producing countries agreed finally on an electric motor which had passed through the various development phases and at that time represented a design which generally could be agreed on. Figure 1 exemplifies the various development steps of electric motor building since 1900 relating to size and output. This relationship (framesize-output rating) has also been adopted by the East European countries (Comecon). For about 7 to 8 years, therefore, a three phase AC standard motor with squirrel cage rotor and IEC dimensions has existed in Europe for the framesize range 56 up to 315 (2⅝\" to 12½\") in protection mode IP-23 1 and IP-44.2 Further extension to the framesizes 355 and 400 is expected to take place during this year upon appearance of IEC publication 72-A. These European IEC standard motors have been fully accepted and adopted in the various areas of the industry. By means of this framesize-ouput rating relationship full exchangeability is obtained regardless of brand. Significant savings in stock keeping for all branches in the industry have been achieved. Due to national peculiarities of the different countries, insignificant deviations from this framesize-output rating relationship are detectable, notably for framesize 90 motors. This, however, does not lessen the advantages of this international standardization."
"A study has been made to arrive logically at appropriate voltage ratings for unshielded fiat conductor cables and round insulated wires in air. The criterion used is corona starting at sea level and at various altitudes for single and multi-insulation systems. These idealized values depend upon the insulation thickness and dielectric constants. Observed data were in adequate agreement with the calculations. It is concluded that some existing constructions may have been rated at excessively high voltages."
"The proposed military standardization handbook states that several independent surveys made by separate agencies predicts that within six to eight years 60-75% of all new aircraft, missile, and ground equipment designs for interconnecting harnesses will utilize FCC. In addition to weight, space, and cost savings, but of no less importance, is the improved system performance obtainable through repeatable electrical characteristics derived by having conductor locations fixed with respect to each other. This characteristic also improves the reliability of fabrication by effectively eliminating wiring errors; e.g., conductors cannot be transposed, maintaining their relative locations within the cable. FCC has many and varied potential applications in the electronics and aerospace industries. As more and more information becomes available on the details of its capabilities, its economic advantages, and its potential for improved reliability, widespread usage will be assured."
"Commutator fusing has increased the reliability of the universal and D.C. electric motors. We must still understand that the connection between the armature's coil and commutator is the weakest link in the entire motor. If we fully understand the theory of commutator fusing very few problems should occur when using it, and this weak link will be a little stronger."
"Radiation vulcanization of rubber insulation can yield large economic savings and potential new products to the wire and cable industry. Application of radiation-compounding technology, which is currently available, may yield significant new advantages to this field. From this work, it is clear that industry is only beginning to fully utilize the efficiency and dynamics of radiation processing."
"The ultimate goal of changing part or all of a hermetic motor insulation system is to either reduce field failures, or to maintain approximately the same low level of field failures while enjoying some other benefit, such as better electromechanical performance. easier manufacture, or simply less expensive materials of construction. Assessing the effect on reliability of new materials or new designs may be a formidable task, but it is an essential one and must be considered in all phases of testing. For this reason we will review the scope of material tests and of simple system tests before describing the development of life tests suitable for hermetic motors up to seven inches in diameter. Typical life test data will also be presented."
"According to the tests in this evaluation, increasing moisture in a hermetic system shortens the life of motorettes. Therefore, every precaution must be taken to eliminate moisture in a refrigeration system. That moisture sensitivity in hermetic systems might be used as a method for shortening motorette test procedure should not be considered because the higher water content is not realistic with normal field conditions."
"The work carried out indicates that the level of moisture sealed into a tube directly affects the rate of formation of decomposition products, such as Refrigerant 22.It is a reasonable assumption that aluminum chloride is formed continuously on the wire. It is not until all the free water becomes chemically combined that anhydrous aluminum chloride can form and begin to catalyze the Refrigerant 22 formation."
"Existing tests with modifications in test procedures to reflect the field conditions have been used to determine the effect of refrigerant 22 on wire enamels.With the NEMA apparatus for repeated scrape abrasion, ultimate softening by R22 was found to be the same for AI/PE, PEI and PE/PE and FU regardless of their initial value. The differences between enamels which appear significant after short exposures to R22 became smaller as the exposure time was increased. The scape resistance of Polyimide wire was unaffected by R22."
"Both the blistering resistance to R-22 and retention of abrasion resistance in R-22 of a polyester-amide-imide resin system are increased as the amide-imide content of the resin is increased."
"The thermal deterioration of oil immersed paper was investigated by mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph. The results obtained are as follows: 1. It was shown that a new assembly using a mercury diffusion pump and Topler pump is very effective for extracting small amounts of gas from oil. 2. The thermal deterioration of kraft paper in oil can be studied over a wide temperature range from high temperatures to normal working temperatures. The thermal deterioration characteristic of kraft paper shown by the logarithm of the generation rate of (CO + CO2) = (Δq) vs 1/T is generally made of two offset line segments of differing slopes. This result differs from those for other materials.3, 4 3. The slope of log (1/Δq) vs 1/T curve above described co-incides with the slope of log (life) vs 1/T plot obtained in measurements of the mean degree of polymerization. 4. According to the above results, the thermal life of kraft paper in oil at normal working temperatures can be estimated using together two types of information: (a) the slope of log (1/ Δq) vs 1/T and (b) the results of actual life tests made at much higher than normal temperatures."
"The temperatures determined from thermogravimetric and/or differential scanning calorimetry or differential thermal analysis experiments will usually serve as an accurate predictor of the results of long-term thermal life testing. These methods may also prove valuable as a quality control tool when standardized for the enamels in production use."
"Isothermal differential calorimetry makes it possible to measure aging reaction rate down to service temperatures. The reactions taking place in the aging processes can be separated by using appropriate gas mixtures for test atmospheres. Reaction rate curves do not give an easy solution to the extrapolation problem of the life test results, because the reaction rate curves may be atmosphere dependent, pre-aging time dependent and pre-aging temperature dependent. For further investigation of the extrapolation problem, conventional life tests should be conducted in the same controlled atmospheres as the reaction rate measurements. The effects of the different aging reactions on the useful lives of insulating materials could then be estimated."
"It may be possible within a short period of time (90 minutes) to thermally rank magnet wire enamel varnish combinations by means of the change in resonant frequency with time of an oscillator incorporating a coil insulated with the material and tested at a temperature of interest."
"Electrical breakdown at low pressures (<;10-5 torr) depends critically upon prior conditioning of the electrode surfaces. The discharge energy is a factor of major importance, with high energy discharges producing low and erratic breakdown voltages. In addition, under high energy discharge conditions anode material becomes a dominant factor, with the more refractory metals (such as Ti, SS, or Ni) capable of significantly better performance than the less refractory metals (such as AI, Cu, or Pb). The breakdown voltage in this case correlates closely with physical properties of the anode material-melting point, specific heat, and density."
"The inservice test results show that a dielectric system, consisting of 0.35 mil Mylar® and a dielectric grade mineral oil, is a suitable dielectric system for lamp ballast capacitors."
"There has been a significant increase in the number of tests made on each oil sample since the original survey in 1958. The dielectric breakdown voltage test, D-1816, using VDE electrodes, was adopted in 1960 and is now being used by seventeen per cent of the laboratories. Moisture content of insulating oil is being measured by an increasing number of laboratories while the use of the interfacial tension test appears to be decreasing. The overall limits for classifying oils into various categories has not changed significantly since 1958. Most utilities recondition large quantities of insulating oil using a filter press or cartridge type filter. Those that reclaim oil use fuller's earth, but the quantity of oil is small compared to the amounts reconditioned."
"The effect of switching surges on the dielectric strength of Askarel impregnated capacitor paper is less than for standard impulses and approximately the same for A.C. From the practical point of view the small variation in breakdown strength resulting from a change in the wave front duration from 35/110 μ sec to 600/2000 μ sec can be neglected in the design of capacitors."
"The present paper covers the test procedure for the evaluation of the thermal endurance of enamelled wires. This procedure has been specified in the IEC publication 1721 and the corresponding national standards. The statistical errors given by the test material and the influence of the temperature deviations are being investigated. For this purpose 208 series of measurements with a total of 4000 specimens were observed and computed by means of a Hewlett-Packard Calculator 9100. It is demonstrated that the results are not altered, if median instead of logarithmic mean values are used. This also applies particularly, if the limits of ±2 °K for the maximum temperature tolerance in the ovens as defined in the relevant standards are considered."
"Form factor, circuitry coverage, dielectric properties, mechanical support and maintainability are considered to be the key to optimizing costs and reliability for conformal coatings. There are other areas that have not been covered but will be noted. These include using existing facilities and personnel whenever possible, and designing a package with materials that are compatible and complement each other when processed."
"Under high humidity service or test conditions typified by MIL-E-5272. commercial epoxy-glass circuit laminates degrade in insulation resistance. Leakage currents often increase to values unacceptable for high impedance circuits. Insulation resistance is comprised of two components in parallel: Surface and volume resistance. Surface resistance is usually controlled by cleaning and the use of conformal coatings. Volume resistance has been little studied and is here investigated in some detail."
"Through perseverance and ingenuity, the problems of fabricating all-polyimide flexible printed wiring harnesses have been overcome. End requirements were such that no lesser product would do. For many applications, however, high-temperature bond strength, or high-inter laminar bond strength or other extreme .requirements may not be considerations."
"Experience has demonstrated that in spite of the most careful analyses of material properties and expected environmental conditions, failures of electronic hardware attributed to potting compounds and encapsulants have occurred in service. Examples of critical failures include cracking of soldered joints and components, excessive changes in electrical characteristics of components and assemblies, chemical reactions between potting and encapsulating materials and other materials of the assembly, and polymer reversion under conditions of high humidity and temperature."
"Non refrigerant factors such as windability, heat shock resistance, varnish solvent resistance and enamel adhesion are of prime importance in selecting a hermetic motor wire. Other test parameters in air are of less significance and should not be used as the primary basis for choosing a magnet wire for hermetic motors. These tests must be performed on wire in the refrigerant environment to be of greatest significance. The influence of the impregnating varnish must not be overlooked or ignored as it does alter the performance of the wire."
"The five granulation PTFE material described in this paper exhibits dielectric strength values at least twice as high as those of the general purpose pelletized PTFE. When this high-electric-strength material is combined with the technology of electroplating PTFE, high-voltage capacitors of superior electrical characteristics can be designed. An example of such a design was discussed, involving stacked-disk low-inductance capacitor banks which have characteristics surpassing those of vacuum units of similar electrical ratings."
"The need for potting and encapsulation compounds which, in addition to possessing excellent electrical properties, are stable to the environment is well known. The new low molecular weight butyl, Butyl LM, appears to fill this need. The properties of Butyl LM described in this paper include: Excellent initial electrical properties. Electrical properties stable over a broad range of temperature, frequency and aging conditions. No hydrolysis in high temperature-high humidity conditions. The lowest water vapor transmission rate of any elastomeric potting compound. No curing exotherm."
"A pre-etch thermal shock treatment effectively stabilized ⅛\" stripline boards of irradiated polyethylene clad with 1 oz/sq ft copper. No evaluations have been completed regarding the effect of this process on other thicknesses or dielectrics. However, it is expected that the experimental procedure used for determining the proper treating cycle may be applicable to all thermoplastic stripline boards. Such processing would add to the cost of a finished microwave circuit, but when balanced against the higher price and weight of reinforced materials and potential failure of unstable circuits, the economics of a stabilizing treatment prove inviting."
"Not long after the introduction of refrigerant 22 (mono-chlorodifluoromethane, or R22) to the refrigeration industry, blistered magnet wire was found in opened hermetic units, and blister testing began. Although a formal standard has not issued, certain test procedures became and remain popular. These methods are inadequate today and a new approach to blister testing is proposed in this paper. A review of the phenomenon of blistering and of the various tests serve as an introduction."
"Initial results indicate that the procedure we developed should greatly improve the reliability of electronic devices and other data processing equipment that are operated in hostile environments. Coated cards have survived laboratory testing at concentrated polluted gas levels of hydrogen sulfide, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and high humidity with no degradation of the coating or no corrosion of the protected metal surfaces."
"The intrinsic electric strength of many insulating solids appears to be in excess of 10 MV/cm. Values in this region have been measured on thin carefully prepared samples with pulsed voltages. In practical applications, however, design stresses well below this value are used mainly, because of reliability requirements, since volume breakdown may be caused by anyone of a number of factors, at stress values which are only a fraction of the intrinsic electric strength of the material. These factors include thermal instability, electrochemical and electromechanical processes, chemical or thermal deterioration and partial discharge erosion or channel propagation, which latter has probably most influence on the lifetime of dielectrics."
"We conclude that during the course of this environmental testing, we did not note any local conditions of temperature and/or mechanical arrangement problems that would preclude the use of this Joy Axivane Fan-Reliance Motor Assembly for nuclear containment service."
"I have only touched on the many areas of concern that the electrical design or applications engineer should consider when designing the Class I auxiliary power systems for a nuclear power generating station. There has been much work and research done over the past 4 or 5 years by committees of IEEE, ASME, ANS, and other societies. The designers, suppliers, constructors, users, and operators for nuclear power generating stations should be fully aware of the results of the work of these committees. The IEEE-Joint Committee for Nuclear Power Standards through its eight subcommittees is preparing various criteria in the areas of single failure criteria, equipment qualification, periodic testing, auxiliary power systems, reactor protection systems, diesel generators, reliability, quality assurance, electrical penetrations, and terminology. We owe a debt of gratitude to those people working on the various working groups, subcommittees and committees for bringing problems and solutions to light so that all of us may have better direction in the design of safe nuclear power generating stations."
"This paper discusses the special insulation requirements for motors installed within the containment structure of a nuclear power plant. Because such motors are essential to ensuring plant safety, a special design approach and its relationship to the broader IEEE standardization program is presented. This discussion is limited to insulation systems such as those used in continuous duty Reactor Containment Fan Cooler (RCFC) motors. These motors drive the large heat-exchanger fans for removal of heat from the containment of ordinary Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR). They also provide air circulation for cooling and filtering during and following a postulated loss-of-coolant accident."
"These tests are by no means complete. An attempt has been made to show some of the philosophy of a test program for comprehensive testing of cable materials and cables themselves. A stepwise analysis of the reaction of silicone materials to the complex containment vessel environments has to be proceeded by a thorough understanding of the possible environments, the test conditions to simulate these environments, and a basic knowledge of the materials. Functional and materials test programs are being carried out concurrently to demonstrate the place of silicone materials in the area of wire and cable."
"In the interpretation of radiation test data, the motor insulation design engineer must be concerned with the determination of allowable levels of degradation of the system materials during radiation exposure. This entails careful selection of acceptable property changes based on in depth knowledge of the actual application."
"The design efforts, the use of inorganic dielectric seals, and the extensive tests on materials, parts, and completed assemblies signify with a high degree of confidence, that the electrical penetration assemblies applied will fulfill their performance requirements for the life of Oconee Nuclear Station."
"Nearly sixty years ago Kamerlingh Ohnnes (1) discovered a curious phenomenon on cooling mercury to liquid helium temperatures. Unlike the phenomena that occurs on cooling some materials, Ohnnes found that the electrical resistance of mercury not only decreased in value with temperature, but at some temperature point, which has become known as “critical temperature,” the mercury suddenly lost all of its resistance. Shortly thereafter a number of other metals were discovered to possess this interesting property. Examples of such metals are lead, tin, and tantalum. Most of these metals had temperatures less than 10°K. A great excitement ensued as a result of this discovery with many believing that at last a method of conducting great amounts of energy with no losses in power had been found. It was soon realized through experimentation that these metals could not sustain very large currents. Indeed instead of conducting an infinite current. when the value of the current exceeded some level of intensity, the superconducting metal became a normal conductor and because the currents were rather large, in some instances the metal vaporized entirely. A great deal of dismay propagated through the scientific community, who at that time were interested in this curious phenomenon. In 1933, Meissner and Ochsenfeld discovered that in addition to losing all of its resistance. a superconductor expelled all of its magnetic field, i.e. B = 0, from the superconducting interior.1 In 1930, de Haas and Voogd2 discovered that the Pb-Bi eutectic, which possesses the property of superconductivity, could sustain larger currents as well as larger fields. Indeed, the relation between currents and fields as expressed by Ampere's law, played an important role in explaining why superconductors were sensitive to currents beyond a certain critical value. It was learned that when the current that circulates through a superconductor exceeds a certain value, the resulting magnetic field repenetrates the material causing it to go normal. This value of the magnetic field is called the critical field. or more precisely, the thermodynamic critical field of the metal. denoted as a Type I superconductor."
"Time varying currents have been applied to wire samples of Nb25%Zr, Nb33%Zr, and Nb. Flux jumping effects were observed by monitoring the flux motion voltage Vf developed along a given length, ℓ, of sample. The currents Ij at which flux jumps occurerd were studied as a function of the rate İj, at which the current was changing at the time a given jump took place. İ's in the range 101 <; İ <; 107 A/sec were employed. Ij remained constant below some value of rate İjA characteristic of a given sample. Above this rate Ij begins to increase monotonically from its constant value, i.e., the sample becomes more stable against flux jumping. İjA represents the point where the power density, Sj, crossing the wire surface begins to exceed S = 0.8 W /cm2, the value which characterizes the onset of film boiling in the helium bath. Sj is calculated from the current Ij and the flux motion voltage Vf present just prior to a given flux jump. A recently proposed criterion for the onset of magnetic instabilities predicts that a transport-current-induced flux jump may occur in a hard super conducting wire of radius R at a current Ifj = 5R[ ℒ π3CJc/ (∂Jc/∂T)]1/2, where Jc is the critical current density; ∂Jc/∂T, the derivative of the critical current density with temperature; and C, the volume specific heat of the superconductor. This function increases from zero at T = a to a maximum at T ≃ 0.8 Tc for many hard superconductors. Therefore, increased stability against flux jumping is predicted with rising temperature in the range 0 <; T <; 0.8 Tc. The increased stability at higher rates found in the present experiments reflects a heating effect due to the poor heat transfer to the helium bath once the power density at the surface of a sample exceeds the 0.8 W /cm2 required to initiate film boiling. Thus, the results indicate that superconducting devices made with certain type II materials having high Tc's can be operated with more stability at temperatures greater than 4.2° K."
"The EEl sponsored Linde study of ac superconducting power transmission lines dealt primarily with a pressurized helium dielectric system having an average electric stress of 200 kV /cm at the specified impulse voltage rating of the line. In this paper I have explored the effect on the overall system economics of varying the maximum allowed dielectric stress through the use of pressurized helium, vacuum or a solid dielectric. While a number of approximations have been made in the course of deriving the relation used to produce the curves shown in Figure 4, the following general conclusions can still be drawn from these results. First, for a reasonable choice of dielectric parameters the increase or decrease in the total system cost from that calculated for the pressurized helium system with EB = 200 kV / cm would generally be less than 15%. Second, for a given value of EB the solid dielectric system will be more expensive than a pressurized helium or vacuum dielectric system. Third, the cost of both the vacuum and pressurized helium dielectric systems decrease monotonically as the value of EB is increased. Fourth, for the solid dielectric system the cost initially decreases as EB is increased, reflecting the decrease in solid dielectric volume and hence dielectric cost, as well as the cost decreases arising from the decrease in size and cost of both the cryogenic envelope and its associated refrigeration requirements. Eventually, however, at high values of EB, the cost will increase with increasing EB, reflecting the increasing cost of the refrigeration needed to overcome the increase in dielectric loss as EB and, hence, the line capacitance increases."
"A stabilized superconducting wire (single) containing a NbZr core coated with copper and insulated with formvar developed dark spots during the operation of a superconducting coil made from such a wire. The spots numbered in the thousands. The spots varied in appearance from dark stains, carbonized areas to blown volcanoes. The dark spots were carbonized areas where the formvar was pyrolyzed leaving a carbon residue, the temperatures were of the order of 700K. These were hot spots. The failure of the superconducting coil was a point failure and not a turn to turn failure. No sign of arcing was observed. The failure occurred at one of the hot spots due to a thermal fluctuation that may have been caused by flux jumping. Some speculations and comments are made as to the cause of hot spots. Some future work is recommended concerning the nature of imperfections at the hot spots and their relation to flux jumping."
"The foregoing data and analysis indicate that an unusual leakage path may be involved in the three order of magnitude increase in the reverse current leakage of a semiconductor junction encapsulated in resin and subjected to high temperature and high humidity. The SiO2-resin interface apparently plays a key part in this leakage. Diffusion of water through the relatively thick resin is involved."
"With the surface test vehicle structure used for the experiments described in this report, significant changes in potential over device surfaces have been measured at distances of 10 to 40 mils from the driving electrodes. This potential propagation has been studied for cases involving moisture sensitivity and instabilities at high temperatures due to organic conformal coatings. Several factors should be kept in mind in applying the reported results to commercial types of integrated circuits. First, the 40 V bias used to induce drift in the test structures is considerably higher than normally used in integrated circuits. All other things being equal, the rate of surface potential drift should scale with the drift bias. A second factor involves distance from the driving electrode. All results given in this report are for an electrode-toprobe FET separation of 10 mils unless noted otherwise. On the basis of the simplified Shockley model of surface instability one would expect the rate of surface potential change to be inversely proportional to the square of the electrode to probe spacing. In integrated circuits the small separation of biased leads and active regions might be expected to aggravate surface ion drift effects. On the other hand, proximity of other interconnects near ground potential might act to limit surface potential changes to acceptable values."
"This material has the following desirable characteristics: (a) toughness, (b) good electrical properties, (c) non-burning and non-dripping, (d) low smoke generation, (e) high oxidative stability, (f) chemically resistant."
"Powder Coating Encapsulation of electronic components has evolved as a real production technique in Europe, Japan and the U.S., over the last three years. This has been made possible by the development of low fusion temperature powder coatings at Hysol Division Dexter, and the development of coating equipment for axial and radial lead components. There are a number of significant advantages over earlier encapsulation methods."
"The effects of the normal variability in pressboard thickness and density can be eliminated using a process of selective placement of radial spacers in the winding."
"The competitive pressures present in to days transformer market require that magnet wires offer economic advantages without a sacrifice in performance levels. Aluminum magnet wire by utilizing the economics offered by the use of aluminum as the conductor metal appears to satisfy these needs. In order to meet the ever increasing demands placed on magnet wires in transformer applications, however, increased performance capabilities are desired. Accordingly, the Anaconda Wire & Cable Company has developed a new aluminum designated as HYTEK 20 which equals the performance levels of EC aluminum and in addition offers a substantial increase in yield and tensile strength properties. This combination produces an overall improved aluminum magnet wire with a higher performance level than offered by EC aluminum."
"Today's high performance military aircraft are a marvel of precision and functional design. They achieve this, however, at the cost of demanding the ultimate in properties from all of the materials used in their construction. This paper describes the construction of a fuel quantity center of gravity sensor system, developed for such aircraft."
"An extensive evaluation of available dielectric materials was undertaken as part of a development program sponsored by the U.S. Army Electronic Command. The best dielectric system for light weight, high energy density, discharge capacitors was determined to be metallized, coated polyethylene pterapthalate. As a result, the following improved energy storage capacitors were developed. 2500 volt capacitors which are smaller and lighter in weight by a factor of two-to-one over existing designs. Capacitors in the 1000 volt to 1500 volt range, not previously possible with high energy densities."
"Today's trend in electric equipment is toward higher ratings. Greater performance is being demanded of every type of equipment and with increased ratings, of course, more heat must be dissipated. Two types of solutions are being used to cope with this increased heat load: 1. Liquid or compressed gas cooling; 2. higher temperature operation. The second solution requires an insulation system of a higher temperature class with thin walls to improve heat transfer characteristics. For small and medium-sized motors used in applications with widely varying loads, such as traction equipment the second alternative offers greater economy."
"New epoxy resin based Vacuum-Pressure impregnation materials have been developed. Thermal aging tests of the 74021 solventless, low viscosity resin and the 77953 micaceous insulation indicate 155°C (Class F) capability. Chemical and gamma radiation resistance of the cured materials are that expected of thermally stable, high heat distortion temperature epoxy resins. Dissipation factor values of the components as well as the combination are very low and give promise of operation at voltage stress levels typical of 13.8 KV apparatus. Voltage endurance tests on aluminum bar samples are in progress and will be reported later."
"As you can see from the foregoing data, the state of the art for making sealed coils has progressed. The latest techniques have been significant from the standpoint of providing low cost and high quality methods of producing sealed windings. As to what technique is the best, a valid case can be developed for each, primarily because of the various types of processing equipment available at the time of manufacture. It is our belief that the sealable armor/mica system has great potential for field servicing of windings for protection against severe environmental conditions. It can be processed with a minimum amount of equipment and skill, while at the same time providing a seal equivalent to or better than other known techniques. For the future, it is expected that the technology of sealing coils with fusable tapes will continue to be developed even further, with special emphasis on primary insulation as well."
"It has been ascertained experimentally that a new aluminum alloy wire is to some extent free from the mechanical weakness of EC aluminum wire. The authors are inclined to think that the former will be suitable for the coil winding process where the magnet wire is apt to be elongated at nozzles."
"The determination of the life of insulating materials at a given operational temperature is one of the most important tests which must be carried out on these substances. Depending upon the type of material concerned, various criteria are used for their study. By accelerated aging under forced conditions an attempt is made to obtain a picture of their behavior at the intended operating temperature."
"Each of the three test methods investigated will give a friction coefficient that could be used on a comparative basis as an industry standard test. The DIN type tester, because of its limited wire speeds cannot be used for testing of actual winding conditions even though it has the continuous measurement feature and is fairly simple to operate."
"With the trend towards equivalent or better performance at reduced costs in electrical insulator materials, Celanex 917 and formula J101 reinforced thermoplastics offers the electrical/electronic molders and end users a new glass reinforced thermoplastic resin for the stringent applications now serviced by thermosets."
"The film insulation on HF coil wires has a significant effect on temperature coefficient of inductance and coil efficiency (\"Q\"). There are important differences in the dielectric properties of those wire enamels which may be used in the field. It is the purpose of this report to show the range of differences that can exist and the manner in which they change coil performance. Also, a practical test method for evaluating insulation properties on production wire samples is outlined."
"A new, principally inorganic board has been developed and is commercially available with the following features: 1. UL recognized for flammability classification SE-O 2. Low smoke generation either smoldering or flaming 3. Excellent dimensional stability 4. Easily fabricated 5. Good moisture resistance 6. High arc resistance 7. High yield (low density) 8. Adequate physical and electrical properties for many electro/ mechanical applicants in consumer and industrial products."
"Due to improvements with the technological properties of aluminum magnet wire and due to the development of new methods of high reliability for connections and terminals for these wires, aluminum is more and more used for windings in small motors."
"Microwave dielectric measurements differ from low frequency measurements because wavelengths are small enough to be the same order of magnitude as the specimen dimensions. The theory of low frequency lumped circuit measurements must therefore be expanded to include wave propagation and distributed constant transmission line impedance calculations. The equipment necessary to cover several ranges of frequency is usually several times more costly than low frequency bridges and specimen holders. Transmission line, resonant cavity, and free space methods are in use and the basic theory of measurement has been adequately covered by many authors, including the References listed at the end of this paper. The shorted transmission line and resonant cavity perturbation method have been recently published in ASTM Test Method D-2520 with emphasis on step-by-step procedures and complete equations necessary for calculation of results. The TE011 cavity for rod or disk specimens is presently being written up as an additional ASTM test method. This method is quite accurate and capable of evaluation of dissipation factor on low loss materials. An ASTM Task Force has recently completed round-robin testing and analysis of a microwave stripline test method. A report of results and conclusions is now in progress. Microwave dielectric measurements are no more accurate than the accuracy in measurement of the dimensions of the specimen."
"Surface conductance of outdoor insulators exposed to pollution and moisture from rain or fog is related to two aspects of insulator application: (a) possibility of insulator flashover and (b) duration and severity of surface arc discharges. This paper will discuss some of the experience with monitoring the surface conductance of porcelain and synthetic insulation under voltage stress and exposed to outdoor weathering in various locations in the U.S. Simple flat surfaces mounted at a 30° angle from the horizontal, and some shed type insulators have been followed in this study. Recordings have been made over periods of several years, comparing results with low and high voltage stress. Results of these outdoor tests are also compared with results of tests of similar surfaces in a synthetic salt fog chamber."
"This paper presents the results of a project which was initiated to develop a procedure for using the Oxygen Index Analyzer to measure the flammability of pressure sensitive tapes and to determine some of the critical variables responsible for causing changes in the flammability of pressure sensitive tapes."
"The new heat-shrinkable materials of the types described offer a simple, economic and effective means of terminating both plastic and paper insulated high voltage power cables which are suited to both indoor and outdoor installation. Extensive laboratory and field evaluation has been carried out on the materials and typical terminations with complete success. The techniques required are straightforward and do not require additional skills on the part of the operator."
"On the basis of this study the following conclusions and recommendations are presented. The estimation of thermal-life values for electrical insulation using truncated data has been proven valid, and a substantial savings of aging time can be realized by its use, particularly when applied to motorette tests. The median method offers the greatest degree of accuracy and reliability as compared to the other two methods studied. The probability-plot and fifth-failure methods offer a significant increase in aging time saved but at a sacrifice of about 0.2% average accuracy and 10% reliability. It is recommended that in making a choice between the three methods consideration be given to each individual set of circumstances, weighing such factors as cost limitations, time urgency and reliability needed."
"Considering first the impulse ratio measurements and Figure 3, the following definitions are made: the breakdown voltage (V) is the peak voltage, the time to breakdown (t) is the duration of the approximately linear portion of the wavefront extrapolated back to the time axis (corresponds to the 10% voltage level) and teff is the time above 63 % of the peak voltage level. Figure 4 summarizes the results. As the rate of voltage application is increased, the time to breakdown decreases (from 5 μs to 330 ns) and the breakdown voltage increases (from 200 kV to 292 kV). If the “impulse ratio” is defined as the ratio of impulse breakdown voltage to dc breakdown voltage then it is seen to vary from 1.05 to 1.5 as the effective time (teff) of the pulse is reduced from 2.9 μs to 90 ns. In all cases the standard deviation of the breakdown voltage was less than 5% and the variation in time to breakdown was not measurable on the trace."
"The brief outline I have given covers only a few of the various polymers investigated; the future applications are vast and it is in the hands of the polymer chemist and the plastics technologist to produce materials with all the accepted properties we have come to know but with the added advantage of working continuously at higher temperatures. Plastics with their new found “stiffness” and recognized weight advantage over metals only need their working temperatures to be raised for them to be first choice in numerous applications. It is then that the engineers and engineering designers will be able to utilize these properties in a whole new range of finished products."
"Standardization work on insulating material appears at first look to be involved and complicated. While simplification is desirable, the standard activity, nevertheless, is coordinated. To the uninitiated the standards work may seem to be slow, dull and tedious. What appears to be slowness is actually the extremely important and necessary give-and-take between a large number of different interests."
"We have seen that many different shielding techniques can be used in fabricating shielded flat conductor cable. These are not the only one available, but at the present time are used in various equipment throughout the country. It has also been noted that these techniques are not cheap, usually relying on expensive materials and relatively complicated fabrication techniques. Flat conductor shielded cables therefore should be applied judiciously and not considered as a universal substitute for round wire shielded cables. Nor can it be said of any of the six types of cables discussed that one is the “best.” Each has its own merits and should be considered accordingly."
"This paper is about the applications of an epoxy impregnated paper insulation to ultra-high voltage systems. An epoxy impregnated paper insulation is a resin-rich, void-free structure, and therefore has extremely superior voltage withstand characteristics. It also has outstanding resistances to thermal cycle and mechanical vibration. Consequently, such insulation system can be applied easily to condenser bushings. From the standpoint of the production facilities, techniques, and economical considerations, in items with an overall length of more than three meters, “pre-fab” type condenser bushings, consisting of several condenser cores, are desirable. In cases when two unit condenser cores are assembled leaving a simple conical shaped gap between them, it is extremely effective to adopt a “potential expanding” type gap designed so that the equipotential surface in the gap will be in the vertical position to the cone surfaces as far as possible. The “pre-fab” type condenser bushing of the 500 kV class was trially manufactured using this arrangement; it displayed all the desired properties. This paper also describes the other examples of applications of epoxy impregnated paper insulation: CT bushings and pulse transformers in the magnetic firing system for high voltage D.C. converters using thyristors, and draw-out type condenser bushing for disconnecting devices used in the compact type substation."
"With many dielectric materials the dielectric constant does increase with temperature; this is due to the softening of the polymeric network. Greater rotation of the molecular dipole at elevated temperature has been attributed to friction increase, which, in turn, increases its loss factor. Loss factor, a product of dielectric constant and loss tangent, is proportional to the microwave energy dissipated in the material. The equation relating the loss factor and dissipated energy per unit volume is given by: W̅ (energy dissipated/volume) = constant Xε\"fE2 where ε\": loss factor f: frequency E: field intensity."
"A relatively new class of urethane elastomers possessing compounding application, performance and end-use versatility are based upon hydroxy terminated polybutadiene homopolymers and copolymers with styrene and acrylonitrile. Mechanical properties are equivalent to conventional urethanes, and costs arc within essentially the same range, using extension with oils. Electrical properties are very good over a wide range of ambient conditions which normally cause degradation of conventional urethanes. Some relationships between conventional diene hydrocarbon rubbers are shown for comparative and interpolative value. A few representative examples of practical compounds are briefly described to demonstrate application versatility."
"From design, production, marketing and end-use points of view it is important that the corona problem, as it relates to electrical devices, be fairly well understood. The object here has been to focus on the four most significant phases of the problem. The principles of the ionization process and stress control are well documented in the literature. Detection-sensitivity requirements, and the corona resistance of insulating materials are related questions that are not as well documented. If the use of more modern insulating materials is desirable for economic reasons, how vulnerable are they to corona attack, or at what level of corona intensity does this cease to be a problem? \"Play safe\" limits imposed by purchase specifications is not an economic solution to the problem. Competitive instincts which can be justified by evidence of increased life of the end product may be the answer."
"Since the beginning of this century, by first working with insulation materials, then evaluation of entire insulation systems, a solid foundation of the time-temperature relationship of the deterioration of insulation has been developed. The time-temperature relationship is established by accepted functional accelerated life tests on the actual units or on models. Correlation of the test procedure with field experience for the purpose of predicting thermal classification and acceptable life has been accomplished. There appears to be some differences of opinion as to the interpretation of the data from the functional accelerated life tests. The accelerated life test was designed to be severe to obtain data in a short period of time; and since these data has been correlated with systems that have much field experience under normal field conditions, it would not seem logical to draw conclusions from these data for systems operating under radically different field conditions. For this set of field conditions, it would appear that a different functional accelerated life test should be used from which to draw conclusions regarding the thermal rating and life."
"The paper demonstrated the high and diversified performance of FCC due to insulation material qualities. The field of FCC application has been expanded into areas where no other cable was acceptable. The savings in volume and weight were made possible largely because of the electrical and mechanical qualities of the insulation materials. The FCC was originally offered as instrumentation cable. Meanwhile, it has proven to be of great benefit also as a power cable, in aerospace power feeders, solar cell array power collectors, etc. Another descendant of the FCC is the flat computer cable with fine narrow spaced round wires. It is a breakthrough as it is used as high speed transmission cable, replacing in many cases coaxial cables. This saves space, weight, and cost. The FCC technology is still in its beginning. Ultimately, it will be used in a very large sector of the wire and cable field as connectors become more available and the knowledge of the FCC performance has widely spread."
"The thermosetting adhesive appears to reduce the thermal life by about 10 to 15°C, However, the thermal life on the basis of 40,000 hours, which the Navy uses for thermal rating varnished samples shows the rating to be greater than 160°C for the heavy build base coat magnet wires. The voltage stress on the single build wires (samples 5 and 6) was the same as that used for the heavy build wires (1 through 4). Therefore the thermal rating of samples 5 and 6 would be less."
"Edge coating can be controlled through the use of a small percentage of magnetic filler, thoroughly dispersed in the resin portion of a coating composition, and a magnetization step during gellation. Dielectric and aging characteristics are not appreciably altered by the magnetic oxide modification. Coating compositions can be optimized with regard to properties such as flow, surface continuity, wetting characteristics, etc. without compromising for edge coating characteristics. Application processes are not lengthened because of the magnetization step. Material savings can amount to 25-50% of the cost of conventional coating materials depending on stator configuration."
"Typical properties were evaluated on a newly developed rubber-like resins. The properties illustrated are: 1. viscosity and cure schedules adjustable to meet specific requirement, 2. good tensile and electrical properties, 3. good retention of tensile properties on long-term exposure at 130°C, 4. high resistance to severe thermal shock, 5. excellent resistance to water."
"A mathematical model has been devised for estimating in-production life of VPI resin systems. It is based on assuming that the viscosity changes with time according to a simple exponential function, that the components contribute to the viscosity of the mixture independently of one another and that a simple additivity rule is valid for logarithms of viscosity. The only parameters concerning the VPI facility are replenishment rate and the maximum acceptable viscosity. All the information concerning the resin systems behaving linearly which is necessary for these computations can be obtained in a matter of days. With non-linear systems, the measurements have to be carried to significantly longer periods of time."
"From the time in the late 1800's when the concept was established of central generators of electrical energy with their attendant distributions systems, the insulation of such transmission lines has been a key element to the health of the electrical industry. The early materials used were those available-wood, glass, ceramics, air, natural resins, and that wonderful product of then-modern science, rubber."
"This kickoff paper for the NEMA Session will cover the highlights in the development of magnet wire industry standards and new test procedures and equipment since the last EI Conference in Boston. The chairman's report will outline current goals and objectives of the Technical Committee and provide an opportunity to summarize many activities not covered by session papers."
"MW-1000 is being expanded to include three magnet wires being used in hermetic motor applications. This paper will review the steps taken to develop the Refrigerant Extraction Test-Residue Method and the procedure for determining the Retained Dielectric Breakdown Level After Conditioning in Refrigerant 22. These two test procedures will help characterize two essential qualities to be controlled in this hermetic industry. Proposed standards, MW 71-C-“Aromatic Polyimide-Coated Round Copper Magnet Wire for Hermetic Motor Applications (Heavy)”, MW 72-C-“Polyesterimide or Polyesteramide-Imide Coated Round Copper Magnet Wire for Hermetic Motor Applications (Heavy)”, MW 73-C-“Modified Polyester or Polyesterimide or Poolyesteramide-Imide Overcoated with Polyamide-Imide Round Copper Magnet Wire For Hermetic Motor Applications (Heavy)”, will be discussed in terms of the high quality guidelines requested by hermetic motor and compressor manufacturers."
"As magnet wire is transferred from package to coil, the designed path takes the wire over, around and through guides, blocks, etc,-all intended to help place the wire at a precise location on the coil. The friction encountered during this transfer is relative to the surface of the film insulation. Although several tests have been used in an attempt to characterize the surface of film insulated magnet wire, none were found to be satisfactory."
"This paper will provide calculated estimates of the sensitivity needed for several methods used to indicate slow-insulation deterioration. The sensitive methods particularly considered are gas product chemical analysis (gas chromatographic or mass spectral), gravimetric, and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The question of the magnitude of the effects with slow reactions at lower temperatures and the limitation on rate measurements with such methods will be considered. Extension of such measurements from accelerated high temperatures, where deterioration is relatively rapid, down to lower temperatures nearer to apparatus operating temperatures, gives promise of more rapid determination of insulation life-providing such results can be correlated with functional performance. The calculation is based on known or published chemical heats of reaction and decomposition rates at elevated temperatures, and extrapolation of such data to lower temperatures. Possible sources of error and interpretation of results will be considered."
"Examination of the results plotted in the graphs demonstrates that they grow whilst resident on the electrode surface. Probably tions i.e. reliability against voltage, -ln R against voltage, In (-ln R) against voltage are all continuous except at a voltage of 9 kV. At this voltage there is a marked discontinuity even though the scatter of the points elsewhere on the smooth curves remains small. The plot against time is particularly noteworthy in that the times are plotted from the start of the breakdown ramp and the time is deduced as a function of ramp rate and breakdown voltage."
"Printed circuit boards using polyimide or modified polyimide matrices have been under exploratory study for most of the past decade. The major driving force behind this work has been the need for improved service reliability in the field along with the harsh economic necessity to cut scrap losses in the manufacturer's plant. As a polymer class the polyimides offered improved thermal stability and chemical resistance versus the standard epoxy systems. Thus, it was expected that boards using polyimide matrices would show less change in electrical and physical properties during the manufacturing cycle and also in their daily use. For example, short term exposure of epoxy boards to soldering temperatures can cause the breakdown of the matrix with a resulting change in the physical and electrical properties of the board at that particular spot. Drilling is another manufacturing process where boards are subjected to high temperatures for short terms. Again physical changes such as smearing will occur and the extent of these changes depends primarily on the properties of the polymer matrix; thus, the search for polymer systems having thermal stability both short and long term."
"Data indicate that AMYLEX wire enamel meets the requirements for high temperature application while still maintaining excellent flexibility, flexibility retention, and Freon resistance. AMYLEX is a Class 220°C+ magnet wire insulation. This cresylic-soluble amide-imide wire enamel is suitable for basecoat and overcoat applications on copper and aluminum substrates with an excellent balance of properties."
"The evaluation of new resins for use as impregnants and/or for embedment of electrical and electronic units is a very difficult process. One of the major problems with the development of new resins is they must be used for a great variety of applications. A new material which has been developed can produce its optimum performance only when it is applied in a fashion which will allow the development of these optimum characteristics. Only too often a user does not get the proper performance because he uses the same method of impregnation or embedment as he has used for other materials. It is strongly recommended that in investigating a new product that some of the effort be expended varying the methods of application to optimize these rather than simply trying to make a new product fit in with the old practices. Tests or method of application are extremely valuable to the end user and more than just a guide in the results obtained."

"The materials of interest in this Conference are generally highly insulating, and possess low carrier mobilities. During the last decade considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the electronic transport in these solids. In the following paper some of the underlying physical ideas and models are discussed, and their predictions are examined in the light of the experimental evidence."
"One of the most dramatic differences in the dynamics of charge transport between high and low mobility materials is the kinetics of carrier (electron-hole or ion pair) recombination. For example, in germanium where the electron and hole mobilities are around 103 cm2/v sec, the second order recombination coefficient1 is around 10−13 cm3/sec, while in anthracene the recombination coefficient2 is about 10−6 cm3/sec. In anthracene the electrons and holes have mobilities close to 1 cm2/V sec and, therefore, the mean free path of the carriers must be on the order of a few angstroms, whether the transport is described in terms of a band model or a hopping model. In pure semiconductors, on the other hand, the carrier mean free path can be thousands of angstroms and we believe that the large difference in recombination cross section is primarily due to the large difference in mean free path. Geminate recombination (i. e., recombination of the original members of a carrier pair) is a phenomenon closely related to volume recombination, and in this paper we will present experimental data which strongly supports the contention that geminate recombination is an important process in low mobility solids; geminate recombination has never been observed in high mobility substances and the experimental indicators are conspicuously absent in at least one organic liquid (neo pentane) where the electron mobility is around 50 cm2/v sec."
"In the general class of polymeric solids, poly(N-vinyl carbazole), PVK, is emerging as one of the most widely studied materials. The transport of charge injected from sensitizing layers, or internally photo-generated, has been reported.1,2,3 All of these studies revealed that the drift mobility of holes in PVK, as measured by the time of flight of technique, is field dependent and is very low in value even at moderately high fields. The mobility μ is found to vary approximately as E2, with a typical value of about 10−7 cm2/v sec at 105 V/cm.1,3 The purpose of this report is to demonstrate that this low, field dependent hole mobility manifests itself in the observation of trap-free space-charge-perturbed currents; the field and time dependence of these currents will be described."
"Photoinjection of charge from some photoconductive materials into low dielectric constant fluids can be observed using light in the visible region of the spectrum. The quantum efficiency for this process is low unless a strong electric field, of order 105 V/cm or greater, is applied. In this paper we describe measurements of negative charge photoinjection from sublimed films of metal-free phthalocyanine into hydrocarbon and dimethyl siloxane fluids. Metal-free phthalocyanine was chosen because it is a well-characterized organic material whose photoconductive properties have been extensively studied.1,2 Films can be prepared by vacuum evaporation and are photoconductive in red light. A transient photoinjection technique was used to measure the mobility of ions released into the fluids, the rate of injection, and the injection efficiency."
"A large number of measurements of electron mobilities in low dielectric constant insulating liquids have yielded values close to those to be expected for negative ions. Recent evidence suggests that electrons initially produced may possess considerably higher mobilities for a short period prior to “trapping” to give finally ion-like carriers. For example, Minday et al.1 obtain one or two orders of magnitude higher mobility in hexane and other liquids purified in an ultrahigh vacuum system, when presumably impurities were reduced to the level at which trapping was negligible. Schmidt and Allen,2 using sub-microsecond x-ray pulses have measured transient currents in a number of ultra-pure liquids which yield mobilities as much as five orders of magnitude greater than found in longer duration experiments. Houser and Jarnagin3 obtained tentative evidence for a fast carrier in flash photolysis studies of doped n-hexane solutions, but their best resolution time (∼1 μsec) was sufficiently long so that the interpretation was not entirely unambiguous. One object of the work reported here was to improve this resolution time by using a high speed pulsed nitrogen laser, and high speed circuits, so as to examine carrier behavior within a few nanoseconds after their creation. By this means it was hoped to examine the behavior of “free” electrons even in normally “impure” systems. Since this work was done Takeda et al.4 have reported on similar measurements with a Q-switched ruby laser, and have found, as have we, conclusive evidence for a very fast initial carrier."
"Injection current measurements in insulators have yielded very valuable information concerning conduction processes and trapping characteristics in the bulk of the material. By using a high intensity step function light pulse, information can be obtained also on carrier trapping at the surface of the crystal."
"In this paper, a theoretical model is described for space-charge-limited currents in a dielectric solid with traps distributed non-uniformly both in the space between two electrodes, and in the forbidden energy gap. The equations derived have been used to explain the experimental current-voltage characteristics of anthracene films as functions of film thickness."
"The electrical conductivity of polyethylene film is increased by several orders of magnitude if iodine is allowed to diffuse into it from aqueous potassium iodide electrodes.1 It appears that neutral iodine rather than iodine ions diffuse and the current growth follows a Fickian diffusion law.2 it has been proposed that a charge transfer process occurs in which an electron transfers from a polymer molecule to a vacant level of the iodine, so causing a mobile electron vacancy in the polymer chain."
"In this work it was originally intended to study the breakdown mechanism in thin films of Mylar (polyethyleneterephthalate) under dc voltage, but as reported earlier,1,2 it was observed that as the applied voltage Va was increased from low values, the conduction current through the film no longer remained steady, but at a threshold field abruptly became oscillatory. Later, this behavior was interpreted in terms of a specific negative resistance of the film connected in series with an adequately high resistance.3,4 This resulted from a reversible electrical breakdown of the film at a well-defined, temperature-dependent voltage drop across the sample, VB. Earlier, Mizutani5 had reported a qualitative observation of current oscillations in polyethylene, and Swan6 had reported a time-varying current and continuous current oscillations superimposed upon a large background current in iodine-doped polyethylene."
"In almost every paper on the conductivity of polymers the term “activation energy” is used. Somewhat less frequently one encounters the terms activation volume and entropy. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these and related terms in a rather general way and to illustrate how mechanical strain and stress can be used, both to modify and to determine some of the important parameters of the rate theory of ionic conduction."
"In recent studies of contact charging of insulators, metals have been used as one of the contacting materials — the electronic properties of metals being reasonably well understood. A number of authors have reported a linear dependence between the contact electrification of insulators and the work function of the contacting metal."
"The surface resistivity of plastic insulators in humid environments is a property of much practical concern, especially in electronics applications. Thus we find various methods of measurement and desired levels of resistivity under given conditions specified by the ASTM, the IPC and other agencies. Oddly enough, there is a dearth of published information about the actual behavior of such surfaces under various conditions of humidity. An old but comprehensive paper by Field1 concludes that: 1) Surface resistivity of plastic dielectrics reaches an equilibrium value in times from 10 minutes to not more than one hour; 2) The equilibrium value is a strong exponential function of ambient humidity in the range 70% to 100% RH; 3) Regain of high resistance on subsequent exposure to 0% RH is generally as rapid as the initial drop at 100% RH or more so; and 4) Surface resistivity of plastics in equilibrium with a stated, high RH ambient is a material property, which permits these materials to be rated for order of merit in this respect."
"Experimental samples of the polymer poly(2, 6-diphenyl-1, 4-phenylene ether) have been solvent-cast and the dielectric relaxation characteristics of the resulting film were measured experimentally as the level of residual solvent was reduced using a heated vacuum desiccator. Polar fluids were chosen for solvent casting so that the contributions of polymer and solvent to observed relaxations could be separated. In a preliminary investigation chloroform (CHCI3) was used, but it proved so difficult to remove sufficient of this solvent so that it did not dominate the losses, that methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), with its smaller molecular volume, was preferred for a more detailed study."
"The nature of the breakdown process in insulating liquids is very complex and over the years many theories of breakdown have been put forward. The most widely accepted theory, and the only one which is given prominence in the existing reviews on breakdown of liquids, is the cumulative ionization theory. This theory has its origins in the early interpretations of results of high-field conduction current measurements in liquids and assumes that breakdown is due to a Townsend-like ionization of liquid molecules by electrons emitted from the cathode. The relevance of the cumulative ionization theory to the available data on breakdown of liquids is questioned by the following facts: 1. The theory is incapable of explaining the dependences of breakdown strengths of liquids on hydrostatic pressure, on the degree of filtration, on stress conditioning and on spark energy in spark conditioning. 2. The theory is contradicted by studies of prebreakdown processes in viscous liquids1 which showed that breakdown results from formation and growth in the liquid of a bubble of vapor. 3. It has been shown experimentally2 that no charge multiplication occurs in liquids at fields of up to 1.2 MV/cm. 4. Significant emission of electrons from the cathode into a liquid is unlikely at fields of up to the breakdown strength.3, 4"
"There have been some previous studies on the electrical breakdown of liquid dielectrics under high frequency fields, and it is generally recognized that the mechanism of breakdown must be a thermal process caused by dielectric heating.1,2 The thermal breakdown phenomenon is described by the following thermal conduction equation cρ ∂θ/∂t = div(K grad θ) + σE2 (1) where θ, cρ, k, and σ represent the temperature, specific heat per unit volume, thermal conductivity and equivalent electrical conductivity of the dielectric, and E is the applied field. Mainly because of complexity of the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity, solutions of this equation cannot, in general, be obtained. However, silicone liquids exhibit a temperature dependence of conductivity which is smaller and simpler than that of many other liquids, and for such materials, it is possible to obtain an approximate solution to Eq. (1)."
"It is well known that a type of predischarge condition, in the form of a tree-like pattern,1–5 may be observed in solid synthetic insulation, especially if the insulation is transluscent. It has long been established that the simplest way to form such a tree-like pattern is to subject the insulation to a very nonuniform electric field, applying either ac or pulse voltage. Hence, the so-called needle test, based on essentially point to plane electrode configuration, has been adopted by many laboratories as a criterion for evaluation of quality of polyethylene or crosslinked polyethylene insulation. The needle is usually molded into a specially prepared sample, which is later subjected to a voltage stress. This procedure may yield certain information about the tested polymer, but does not necessarily provide any relevant information about a cable product made of this polymer. This is primarily true because the dielectric strength of a molded sample can be very different from that of the cable product, whose quality depends directly upon extrusion conditions and control."
"The traditional concept of intrinsic electric strength (i. e. s.) permits of inhomogeneity of structure only on a scale comparable with lattice dimensions. Theoretical treatments of electrical breakdown embrace the effects of impurity contents and defects typified by the presence of interstitial atoms or vacant lattice sites, but are unconcerned with macroscopic defects which would in any case lead to extrinsic failure."
"Previous papers1,2 have described the effect of particles on corona and ac breakdown in compressed SF6, and have outlined the calculations for the motion of metal spheres under the influence of the alternating field. In this paper the calculated particle motion is discussed in detail, and comparisons are made with the observed bounce height and corona produced by spherical particles. Further breakdown measurements have been obtained with a 150 mm ID, 250 mm OD coaxial system in SF6, and the results are considered in terms of the particle motion."
"Paschen's law states that the static-breakdown voltage Vs of a gas in a uniform field is a function of pd only (p is the gas pressure and d the electrode separation); this is consistent with the fact that both α/p and γ are functions of E/p (α, and γ are the effective ionization coefficient and the secondary ionization coefficient respectively and E is the applied electric field strength, V/d)."
"In previous papers, the authors have described empirical1 and semi-empirical2 methods of estimating minimum breakdown voltages for gas-insulated systems. With both methods, extensive use has been made of existing analytical techniques to compute fields for standard3 and practical arrangements.4–6"
"It has been known for a long time that the measured values of the static permittivity of monohydric alcohols usually exceed values calculated from the Onsager equation1 using a magnitude of dipole moment estimated from dielectric measurements on the vapor or dilute solution. Such a departure may be explained by the existence of short range forces which may be taken into account by the \"g\" factor which appears in the expressions of Kirkwood2 and Fröhlich. 3,4 Oster and Kirkwood, 5 using a model consisting of molecules linked into infinitely long chains by rigid hydrogen bonds with free rotation about the bonds, calculated \"g\" to be 2. 57. Values of \"g\" obtained experimentally from measured values of static permittivity tend to a limiting value at low temperatures and fall with increasing temperature. Typical examples for the alcohols6 considered in the present paper are shown in Figure 1. The variation of \"g\" with temperature has been explained by Dannhouser and Cole7 by assuming a distribution of lengths of hydrogen bonded chains. It is usually found that the low temperature value of \"g\" exceeds the Oster and Kirkwood value and this has been explained by Brot8 by assuming that hindered rotation about the hydrogen bonds favors a configuration leading to a high resultant dipole moment."
"Measurements of the low frequency limiting value of the relative permittivity e can provide useful information about molecular interactions in liquids and gases. In particular, the value of e for a solution of a polar solute in a nonpolar solvent may be measured as a function of concentration and temperature to study association in the liquid state. This technique is extensively used to examine hydrogenbonding interactions and may be used to study weak complexes involving charge transfer effects.1,2"
"Dielectric polarization, whose activation energy is nearly equal to that of the electrical conduction, has been found in many alkali-silicate glasses and is presumed to be due to the migration of alkali metal ions1,2 or some special type of interfacial polarization.3 However, the mechanism of polarization has not yet been clarified."
"Several years ago, an ultra-low-frequency bridge employing operational amplifiers and a two-phase source was described.1 Since that time, improved operational amplifiers and signal sources have become commercially available and permit the extension of this same technique to higher frequencies."
"Reinforced microwave stripline dielectric substrates as thin as 0. 008 inch (200 micrometers) are anisotropic and have a somewhat indeterminate thickness. A filled cavity method has been developed to measure these materials. The resonant frequency is independent of specimen thickness so that an accurate measurement of the latter is not required. The permittivity of other low loss dielectrics with a wide range of permittivity and thickness can be readily determined. The use of the method for measuring loss tangent will require the development of plating methods to provide a reproducible cavity Q."
"Frequency selective filters play an important role in electronic and microwave technology, and progress in most branches of electronics is closely linked to advances in filter design. The designer would like to have the widest possible control over the filter's design parameters and characteristics. Dielectric resonators allow such flexibility through the choice of dielectric materials and various possible filter geometries. Microwave filters, using single crystalline or ceramic titanates and oxides, such as strontium titanate, rutile, barium tetratitanate, and combinations of these, were used in the following experiments. Interest in these devices has been growing over the past ten years, since Okaya's work on rutile resonators,1 especially with the stress on miniaturization and the introduction of microwave integrated circuitry (MIC)."
"Over the past six years a body of useful dielectric information has been generated specifically directed to the design of high pulse power equipment. This equipment has a growing importance to the fields of controlled nuclear fusion and nuclear simulations. For these applications it is required to discharge 105-107 joules into loads within typical periods of 10−6-10−8 seconds. The corresponding peak powers (approximately 1013 watts) can only be achieved economically by energy storage techniques before discharge into the load."
"It has been recognized for some time, that oil impregnated cellulose paper will not be a useful insulating material for cable carrying in excess of 500 kV because the thickness of the insulation layer would become excessive and the dielectric losses associated with such thick structures would be prohibitive. Also, removal of the considerable heat generated in such a structure would become very difficult if not impossible. To overcome this problem, it has been suggested that the cellulose paper be replaced by some synthetic material possessing better dielectric properties than does cellulose paper. Paper-like structures obtained from such polymeric materials as polyphenylene oxides1 and polyolefins2 have shown considerable promise as replacements of cellulose paper in cable insulation. While polyphenylene oxides exhibit many attractive properties for the contemplated use in oil filled cables, they are not yet available as an industrial product with fixed specifications. Polyolefins are commercially available in large quantities and at relatively low cost. In view of these considerations and the encouraging results reported by Buehler et al.2 a more detailed study of polypropylene paper has been undertaken and the results are reported in the following sections."
"It is generally accepted at present that the conductivity of “dry” cellulose may be expressed by the relation,1,2,3 σ = σ1 exp(−W1/kT) + σ2 exp(−W2/kT) (1) where the symbols have their usual meaning and where Τ covers the temperature range from 20° to 160°C."
"Mineral oils of the type used in cable applications contain varying amounts of aromatic, naphthene and paraffin structures together with some non-hydrocarbon (sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen compounds). Although it was shown that the magnitude of the dielectric loss in these oils is a function of the total aromatic content, the dispersion in the values of the dielectric constant and the change in the molar polarizability with temperature indicate that these oils behave dielectrically as dilute solutions of polar molecules in a non-polar medium.1 The dielectric constant and dielectric loss is also characterized by a distribution of relaxation times."
"The dc conduction properties of thin film insulators are of interest because of their technological applications as dielectrics, electrical insulators, and passivating layers and because of the diverse physical phenomena possible with metal-insulator-metal systems. Experiment and theory have centered on the current-voltage-temperature characteristics, but definitive identification of conduction mechanisms are rare because: (1) Many microscopic models lead to similar macroscopic functional relationships, (2) microscopic models depend on parameters which are not easily measured; these include trapping energy levels, trapping cross-sections and hopping probabilities, and (3) the metal-insulator-metal systems cannot be fabricated with sufficient reproducibility to distinguish among a variety of plausible mechanisms."
"Dielectric films are used for many purposes in semiconductor devices. For insulating applications these films when applied to the semiconductor surfaces should exhibit stable electrical characteristics. There are four types of commonly observed charges in an insulating-semiconductor structure. These are (a) mobile impurity ions; (b) fixed surface charges; (c) induced charges; and, (d) interface states. The last charges are also known as fast surface states and these are least understood. However, they appear to affect many electrical device characteristics to a great extent. In order to understand the nature of these charges and their effects on the semiconductor devices, the silicon-silicon dioxide system has been studied by many previous investigators.1, 2, 3"
"In the electrical industry today, epoxies are being used as insulating materials for an increasing number of applications. Epoxies are characterized by good electrical properties when properly cured. The curing process and the curing conditions largely determine the performance of the epoxy system as an insulating material. The importance of the curing reaction, in utilizing an epoxy, prompted the present investigation of the system bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether/diethanolamine adduct."
"This paper is part of a continuing study of several common epoxide/ hardener systems. Previous work1,2 is extended to the epoxide/ polyamide system, an example of which is bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether/General Mills' Versamid 140."
"This is a report on the effects of relatively low intensities of nuclear radiation on various organic dielectrics in capacitors, where a particular sensitivity to such radiation was noted. The purpose of the study was to select a suitable dielectric for high voltage capacitors that are to withstand a minimum dosage of 2 megarads, but preferably 20–40 megarads (40 year's life). These capacitors are to be located in the containment vessels of nuclear power facilities where they are to protect the primary coolant motors (6600 volts, 3 phase) from overvoltage surges. This requires units with a rated voltage of 3810 volts, line to ground."
"Corona is an important degradation mechanism for insulation in high voltage systems. One way in which corona is minimized in high voltage power supplies, for example, is to design the supplies for the lowest possible ac voltage on the secondary of the power transformers and to stack secondaries to attain the desired high voltage. The effect of stacking transformers secondaries is to superimpose a biasing dc potential on the ac of the winding. It therefore becomes important to determine the effect of the superimposed dc on the ac corona inception voltage. Another important reason for determining the relation of corona to ac plus dc is that in the normal design of transformers the ac corona test voltages are usually specified on the basis of the peak of the ac plus dc impressed on the windings and this leads to an unrealistic test requirement, since it does not stress the insulation in a manner simulating operating conditions. This usually results in overdesign of the transformer and leads to excessive weight."
"One method of analyzing radiation and propagation above a surface is to employ an effective surface impedance to describe the effect of the boundary. In this paper an expression is derived for the effective impedance at grazing incidence of a slightly rough interface between air and a finitely conducting medium for which the Leontovich boundary condition is applicable. The perturbation technique of Rayleigh and Rice is employed, and attention is restricted to vertical polarization. The resulting effective surface impedance consists of two terms, the impedance of the lower medium when the surface is perfectly smooth and a term accounting for roughness. The latter term can be complex in general and depends on the strengths of the roughness spectral components present. The result is applicable to either deterministic periodic surfaces or random rough surfaces. Various alternate definitions of the effective surface impedance are examined and are seen to be equivalent. The analysis of power flow at the surface permits the interpretation of the interaction process in terms of scattered fields."
"This paper deals with an estimation of the effect of sea state on HF and VHF ground-wave propagation loss across the ocean. For this estimation, an expression is employed that was derived in part 1; it gives the effective surface impedance in terms of the spatial height spectrum of the surface. Two empirical models are employed for the height spectrum of the ocean, the directional Neumann-Pierson model and the isotropic Phillips wind-wave model. These effective surface impedances accounting for sea state are then inserted into a standard ESSA computer program giving the basic transmission loss above a spherical earth. The dependence on sea state is plotted in curves which show the excess loss in decibels over a smooth sea. The propagation loss to points at various heights above the sea is also calculated. Normal sea state variations are seen to be negligible below about 2 MHz but produce a maximum excess loss at about 10 to 15 MHz."
"Over 18,000 frames of data acquired with a narrow-beam azimuth and elevation scan high-frequency backscatter sounder located at Boulder, Colorado, during the period October 1964 through June 1968 have been examined and classified. Analysis of these data has revealed that the ‘irregular structure’ of the midlatitude ionosphere is the rule rather than the exception. Irregularities of varying scale size and apparent motion were present in about 90% of the observations made during almost one-half a sunspot cycle. The ‘signatures’ observed by this HF radar system have been categorized into eight generic types, which have been labeled with names roughly describing their appearance on the range-azimuth scan record. The relative diurnal and seasonal occurrences, as well as the qualitative sunspot cycle and geomagnetic correlation of these signatures, are presented."
"The transform relation between the field distribution and the angular spectrum forms the basis for the application of interferometry to propagation research. It is convenient to divide interferometry into instrumental combination and transform techniques which measure these Fourier relations to provide propagation mode resolution in terms of direction and angular width. Conventional direction-finder instrumentation represents the limiting case of single plane wave solution to the interference field. Computer instrumented interferometers and sampling arrays provide the capability for more general wave field analysis based on non plane wave models. This paper is a summary of interferometry techniques for direction finding, angular spectrum, angular width, and coherence ratio measurements and reviews the evolution of interferometers for propagation research. The reference list includes works from the radio astronomy and propagation literature relevant to fundamental interference analysis and interferometer instrumentation."
"A simple derivation of the second-order Faraday rotation relation is given that shows the contribution of the different effects. A rapid ray tracing program is used to evaluate the errors in first- and second-order relations, and these are plotted under a variety of conditions. A modified form of the second-order relation is suggested to reduce the errors. Magnetoionic path splitting does not affect the Faraday rotation to the third order. The only significant errors are those caused by the high-frequency approximation and by refraction. The first of these is almost independent of zenith angle. The second is zero for magnetically east-west propagation, when accurate results can be obtained to very large zenith angles. The ratio of the Faraday fading rates on 20 and 40 MHz, near the center of the transit, can be used to determine the critical frequency of the ionosphere to within 1 MHz."
"The rather well defined level of geomagnetic activity that occurs with developing sunspots has been examined by using 38 years of daily geomagnetic Ap activity indices and sunspot number Rz. It is found that the Ap values between about 70 and 160 are characteristically associated with sunspots that develop rapidly and reach a peak in number about three days before the occurrence of these levels of Ap. The daily Kp sums from about 45 to 55 were found earlier to be similarly associated with Rz. This relationship predominates at this Ap level during the years in which the average annual Rz is above 50 or more. In quieter solar years some of this range of Ap values tend to be part of a broad recurrence tendency for Rz that peaks about a week before this level of geomagnetic activity is attained; this pattern is a characteristic of a lower level of geomagnetic disturbance. The rapidly developing spots with their high association to solar flares apparently contribute to the magnetospheric energy budget through enhanced electromagnetic radiation. The broad recurrence tendency of lesser disturbance that peaks six to eight days earlier would probably be predominantly due to the Chapman-Ferraro compression of the magnetosphere by corpuscular emission from the solar ‘M regions’ of Bartels."
"In this paper we derive the closed-form solution of the three-dimensional fields excited by an arbitrarily oriented dipole in a cylindrically inhomogeneous isotropic plasma. Geometrical optics is used to represent the fields. The eikonal equation is solved to give the wave fronts from which the rays are obtained. A closed-form representation is obtained for the differential cross-section of a three-dimensional tube of rays thus yielding the amplitude of the wave. Closed-form expressions are also obtained for the normal vector, binormal vector, and torsion along the rays so that polarization is readily determined. For the special case where the antenna is located on axis, the radiation patterns depend only on the on-axis and peak electron densities. The solutions show good agreement with solutions obtained for a cylindrically stratified plasma in an earlier study."
"A rigorous theory for the self modulation of an amplitude modulated electromagnetic wave propagating along the direction of the magnetic field has been developed; the effects of self interaction and mutual interaction for both extraordinary and ordinary modes of propagation have been considered simultaneously. It is shown that the ordinary mode of propagation becomes demodulated and that the extraordinary mode shows strong over-modulation during its propagation through the medium, when the carrier frequency equals the electron gyrofrequency."

"Undesirable noise in the radio-interferometer tracking system (General Electric Mod III) at Cape Kennedy during the Mercury-Atlas and Ranger-Atlas orbit series is alleged to have resulted from stochastic refractive ray bending and associated multipath conditions. Surface-to-16,000-foot meteorological data for eight to nineteen shots were examined, using various functions of water vapor-related parameters and temperature as noise predictors. Spearman rank correlations, significant at the 1% level, were found between all the water vapor-related measurements tried and a measure of tracking noise. A threshold level of 370 IV-units surface value was found (corresponding to about 19 gm-m−3 of water vapor), beyond which tracking problems are likely to develop. Results of earlier investigators are confirmed, and the present investigation strongly implies that the source of the noise problem indeed lies in the lowest layers of the atmosphere. Limited attempts to correlate noise with atmospheric inhomogeneities were unsuccessful."
"Beyond-the-horizon 2-GHz radio paths in the Mekong Delta have shown large diurnal and seasonal propagation variations, which sometimes resulted in serious degradation of system performance. Measurements of refractivity gradients, in January and February 1970, using a high-resolution radiosonde technique showed a higher incidence of subrefraction than was indicated by the available climatological statistics. Low-based elevated layers with extreme superrefractive gradients were occasionally observed over wide areas."
"From the monthly average values of radiorefractivity near the ground surface and at the 850-mb level (approximately 5000 ft above sea level), values of refractive index gradient have been computed between ground surface and 5000 ft above sea level for the 12 Indian radiosonde stations. These values of N gradients have been examined to estimate super-refraction of radio waves in the lower troposphere over India. Maps showing isopleths of refractive index gradient over the country during different seasons are also presented."
"The reflection of a horizontally polarized, impulsive plane wave by a weakly perturbed ionosphere model is considered. A linear electron density profile and a constant collision frequency are assumed for the unperturbed model, and magnetic field effects are neglected. The transient response is formulated as an inverse Fourier transform of the first-order frequency domain solution. For the special case of a thin-layer irregularity, a numerical inverse transform is used to obtain responses that satisfy causality. It is shown that the presence of the thin-layer irregularity is to modify the waveform of the reflected transient."
"A determination, in geometric optics approximation, of the forward and backscatter characteristics of spherical overdense clouds having (1) a Gaussian decrease with distance from the center, (2) a sech2, or exponential, decay, and (3) an inverse-square decrease, showed that the backscatter cross section for the inverse-square distribution is always larger than for the other two distributions. As the center-point density increases, the backscatter cross section obtained with the Gaussian sphere most rapidly takes on the characteristics of a conducting sphere, that of the sech2 distribution lags slightly behind, but that of the inverse-square sphere never gets close to the result for a conducting sphere. In forward scatter, the inverse-square distribution shows the largest cross section and a fairly rapid increase with center-point density, the sech2 distribution has an essentially constant cross section, and the Gaussian, which has the lowest forward scatter cross section, shows a slight decrease with center-point density."
"Cross-correlation and ‘similar fades’ time delays obtained on widely spaced aerial pairs in the north-south direction have been used in investigating north-south ionospheric motion at the low-latitude station of Ibadan (magnetic latitude, 3°S), and a north-south velocity of considerable magnitude is revealed. It is also found that, if an aerial spacing of at least one-half kilometer is used at this latitude, systematic diurnal and seasonal variations of this velocity can be detected. The procedure of the analysis is briefly outlined, and the reliability of the results is discussed."
"Spectra of amplitude and amplitude-difference fluctuations have been obtained over a millimeter-wave propagation path, demonstrating substantial aperture-filtering effects."
"H. G. Booker's (1956) theory of the radio aurora as a random assembly of field-aligned irregularities has been unsuccessful in explaining many observations, and this lack of success has led to the application of plasma instability theory to the phenomenon. The ion-acoustic instability theory of D. T. Farley (1963) has had some success, and evidence is rapidly accumulating that the ion-acoustic instability is an important mechanism in the production of radio aurora. A second theory, originally developed by A. Simon (1963), is currently being applied to the radio aurora. This theory involves another type of plasma instability, which is here called the ‘drift-gradient instability.’ Both instabilities require the presence of an electric field directed perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. For the ion-acoustic instability the critical condition is that the electric field exceeds a threshold value of the order of 30 mv m−1. The drift-gradient instability, however, requires a positive gradient of ionization density in the direction of the electric field. The growth of this drift-gradient instability is dependent on the condition that electron-ion drift velocity divided by the scale length of the plasma density exceeds a value such that damping due to diffusion is overcome. Experimental data are reviewed in the light of the two theories. It is shown that all the major features of the so-called diffuse radio aurora (type B1 in the provisional nomenclature of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, IAGA, 1968) can be explained by the ion-acoustic instability theory if account is taken of the nonlinear production of secondary irregularities discussed by J. P. Dougherty and D. T. Farley (1967). Progress to date in applying the drift-gradient instability theory suggests that most features of the discrete radio aurora (type B2 and B3 in the IAGA classification) may be explained. No attempt is made at this stage to relate the theories to forward scatter observations of the radio aurora. The theories suggest that appropriate observation of the radio aurora may be used as a powerful ground-based tool for quantitative studies of electric fields in the ionosphere. Existing experimental data are discussed from this point of view, attention being paid in particular to substorms and pulsations of the Bi type radio aurora in the Pc 5 frequency range. Results suggest that Pc 5 magnetic pulsations are associated with standing hydromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere with, contrary to some currently held assumptions, an antinode of electric field and field line displacement in the ionosphere. Progress in relating B1-type radio auroral events to IPDP micropulsation events is reviewed. If a relation can be established, it will allow further deductions to be made concerning the electric field in the magnetosphere. The aspects of the ionospheric electric field that can be monitored by an auroral radar system and the specifications for such a system are outlined."
"During the summer of 1968, two-beam, incoherent-scatter radar measurements were made at Arecibo. The two beams were formed by two separate feeds for the Arecibo reflector, one a line feed which illuminated essentially all of the reflector, and the other a horn feed which effectively illuminated about 500 feet of the reflector. A by-product of this experiment was the calibration of the near-field correction to the backscatter gain of the line-feed system. This was obtained by comparing the power received as a function of range in the two radar systems. The measured loss of gain in the near field for the line feed was about 1.5 db at a height of 100 km."
"The Radio Astronomy Explorer satellite (RAE-1) is the first spacecraft designed exclusively for radio astronomical studies. It is a small, but relatively complex, observatory including two 229-meter antennas, several radiometer systems covering a frequency range of 0.2 to 9.2 MHz, and a variety of supporting experiments such as antenna impedance probes and TV cameras to monitor antenna shape. Since its launch in July, 1968, RAE-1 has sent back some 1010 data bits per year on measurements of long-wavelength radio phenomena in the magnetosphere, the solar corona, and the galaxy. In this paper we describe the design, calibration, and performance of the RAE-1 experiments in detail."
"In this paper we investigate the radiation from magnetic line source covered with a moving uniaxial or isotropic sheath (nondispersive dielectric or cold plasma). The far-zone radiated fields and the radiation pattern for the four cases, (a) uniaxial dielectric sheath, (b) isotropic dielectric sheath, (c) uniaxial plasma sheath, and (d) isotropic plasma sheath are obtained, and the effects of the motion of the sheath on the far-zone radiated fields and the radiation pattern for each case are discussed by showing some numerical results of the radiation pattern."
"Explicit expressions are derived for the fields radiated by layered structures of linearly and sinusoidally varying thickness. Both plane-wave and concentrated-source excitations are considered. The solutions are based on a full-wave analysis which uses the exact boundary conditions. It is shown that the solutions are, in general, consistent with the reciprocity relationships."
"The directive gain of circular Taylor patterns is determined. It is shown that so-called optimum patterns, i.e., uniform sidelobes in all planes, are severely limited for planar apertures because of excessive sidelobe power. The optimum directive gain of the circular Taylor pattern with a given sidelobe level can be obtained by appropriate design."
"The computational method of conjugate gradients for linear operator equations is given. This technique is applied to the solution of the integral equation that relates the aperture distribution and the far-field pattern. This problem is treated from the variational setting by minimizing an error functional. In searching for the solution, a sequence of expanding subspaces in a function space is generated via the Frechet differential of the error functional. The error functional is minimized in each of the subspaces and thus forms a sequence of approximating solutions. This iterative procedure may be conveniently implemented on a computer. Two synthesis problems are treated using this technique, and the results are discussed."
"The dispersion curves have been computed for a wide range of wavelengths from electromagnetic waves to electrostatic waves in a magnetoactive warm plasma with a Maxwellian velocity distribution function. The computation was carried out mainly for the perpendicular propagation mode. The upper hybrid resonance is the connection point of the electrostatic waves and the electromagnetic waves. The electrostatic waves not associated with the upper hybrid resonance are subjected to electron cyclotron damping when the wavelength becomes long. Oblique propagation is allowed for the electrostatic waves in a frequency range from the plasma frequency to the upper hybrid resonance frequency in the long-wavelength region where Landau damping can be neglected and where the electrostatic mode smoothly connects to the electromagnetic X-mode. In a slightly inhomogeneous plasma, the Bernsteinmode electrostatic wave can escape by being converted into the O-mode electromagnetic wave; two reflections take place during this escape process. The frequency range of the escape coincides with the Cerenkov radiation of the electromagnetic waves, but these two mechanisms indicate clear contrast in its origin. The electromagnetic Cerenkov radiation is produced interacting with the high-energy plasma beam with velocity range 100vth < v < 1000vth (for the nonrelativisitic plasma), where vth is the electron thermal velocity, whereas the origin of the electrostatic waves is in the interaction with the low-energy plasma beam."
"The nature of the reflected signal is considered for an electromagnetic impulse impinging on a semi-infinite plasma and a finite plasma slab terminated by a perfectly conducting surface at arbitrary angles of incidence and for both polarizations. The inverse Fourier transform technique is used and leads to a statement for the reflected signal in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind. The results are shown graphically for both the TE and TM case for all angles of incidence between normal and π/2."
"The effects of electron temperature on the radiation fields and the resistance of a short electric dipole antenna embedded in a uniaxial plasma have been studied. The radiation condition for solving Maxwell's equations is discussed, and the phase and group velocities for propagation are given. It is found that for ω < ωp the antenna excites two waves, a slow wave and a fast wave. These waves propagate only within a cone whose axis is parallel to the biasing magnetostatic field B0 and whose half-cone angle is slightly less than sin−1 (ω/ωp). In the case of ω > ωp the antenna excites two separate modes of radiation. One of the modes is the electromagnetic mode, while the other mode is of hot plasma origin. A characteristic interference structure is noted in the angular distribution of the field. The input and the radiation resistances are calculated and are shown to remain finite for nonzero electron thermal velocities. The effect of Landau damping and the antenna length on the input and the radiation resistances has been considered."

"Cross-polarization distortion (XPD) due to nonspherical raindrops may be a serious problem for 18.5- and 30-GHz microwave radio communications, but no measured data have yet been published. This paper presents a simple approach for estimating XPD due to rain from the effects of differential attenuation on canted spheroidal raindrops. Values of average raindrop canting angle, &A, are predicted from R. A. Semplak's measurements of differential attenuation taken over a one-year period, published in 1970. Independent observations of canting angle from two rainstorms, published in 1971 by M. J. Saunders, agree with the predicted values and also indicate values for the senses (positive versus negative) of raindrop canting angles. Estimated values of XPD due to rain are graphically presented for various frequencies, rain rates, and typical path lengths. The paper concludes that the operational limits placed on communications by XPD due to rain are comparable to the limits due to rain attenuation or fading."
"Recently, Laussade and Yariv [1970] presented a new method for computing the average field 〈u〉, the average irradiance 〈uu∗〉, and the mutual-coherence factor 〈u(1) u∗(2)〉 at two points equally far from the origin, for a monochromatic plane wave propagating through a uniformly turbulent, nearly transparent medium. We wish to make the following comments on this work:"
"The vertical flux of 0+ in the F region has been obtained from incoherent scatter radar measurements at Millstone Hill. The paper reports an investigation of the altitude variation of the flux during two 24-hour periods in March taken a year apart. We find that except for a brief period around sunrise the flux is always directed downwards at altitudes below 500 km and its magnitude seems governed simply by the competing processes of production, loss, and diffusion. On the quiet day above 535 km the flux is directed upward in the afternoon when the electron density is not changing with time. This upward flux reached a peak value of ∼108 ions cm−2 sec−1 near 700 km altitude and then decreased at higher altitudes. This decrease is attributed to charge exchange with hydrogen. During the night on this day there is evidence for a downward flux of 3 × 107 O+ ions cm−2 sec−1 from the protonosphere. Additional H+ ions may be diffusing through the 1000-km level and contributing to the maintenance of the nighttime Flayer, but they would not be detected in our observations. On the disturbed day there is no evidence of a flux of ionization into the protonosphere except at sunrise. We suggest that this change is brought about by a large reduction in the abundance of neutral hydrogen, resulting from increased escape either via the polar wind or from the heating of the atmosphere in the vicinity of the auroral zones. Thus, it is suggested that the abundance of neutral hydrogen at the base of the exosphere is reduced at high latitudes during magnetic storms."
"Measurements of the vertical flux of 0+ in the F region have been made by the incoherent scatter technique at Millstone Hill. In part 2 of this paper, evidence was presented for the existence of fluxes of ≥ 108 cm−8 sec−1 into the protonosphere during the day. In this paper we employ the altitude variation of the O+ flux to infer the magnitude of the proton flux in the charge-transition region. Based on continuity considerations and the theory of minor ion diffusion in the topside of the F layer, we have attempted to determine the abundance of H+ in the altitude interval where it is a minor ion. The results indicate that the abundance of neutral hydrogen near 600 km must exceed about 108 cm−8. However, the absence of detectable amounts of H+ in the signal spectra taken near 1000 km indicates that the transition altitude must be above 1000 km and in turn the neutral-hydrogen abundance cannot exceed this estimate by more than a factor of 3."
"A description of the latitudinal, diurnal, seasonal, and solar-cycle variations of F-layer-produced scintillations, based on a comprehensive review of the literature, is given. Three distinct latitudinal regimes are discussed in regard to scintillation behavior and the quantitative utility of observations reported in the literature. A semiquantitative empirical model is suggested to describe the strength of scintillation-producing irregularities of F-layer electron density. Recent work suggests that more quantitative modeling might now be fruitful, but gaps in fully quantitative data exist. The prime needs are for observations at very high latitudes and for calibration of scintillation indices used at very low latitudes."
"A VLF propagation and a D-region aeronomy model have been used to predict the effect of two solar eclipses on VLF propagation to Aztec, Arizona. Transmissions at 12.2 kHz from Hawaii were monitored during the eclipse on September 11,1969; and transmissions at 12.0 kHz from Trinidad, at 24 kHz from transmitter NBA, at 12.5 kHz from Forestport, New York, and at 17.8 kHz from transmitter NAA were monitored during the eclipse on March 7, 1970. The VLF phase predictions were found to agree with measurements except for the two nearly coincident northerly paths from Forestport and NAA."
"At HF or higher frequencies, in computing the polarization conditions along a radio ray traveling in the ionosphere, it is often sufficient to express the results in terms of the Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization, obtained as an integral (along the path) of the phase difference between the ordinary and extraordinary components. The computation simplifies when the quasilongitudinal (QL) approximation of magneto-ionic theory can be applied. The QL approximation is invalid at any point where the ray becomes transverse to the geomagnetic field, and in some regions around that point. In 1963 George A. Dulk showed that neglect of this effect may lead to major errors. In considering an oblique path with sky-wave reflection, it is easy to be misled into thinking that a transverse condition is unlikely except on east–west paths, particularly in equatorial regions. On the contrary, transverse conditions are likely to occur under a wide range of conditions at all latitudes and for all propagation directions. This presentation describes conditions of ray geometry and magnetic latitude, which result in transversality at some point along the path. The method for defining the conditions is shown to be applicable even when the ray is permitted to follow a twisted path in three dimensions, and the geomagnetic field is defined under very general assumptions. The basic results are also directly applicable to problems concerned with the reflection of HF signals by field-aligned ionization."
"A multiple midlatitude 6300-Å auroral arc occurred during the recovery phase of a geomagnetic storm on March 8/9,1970. Variations of the arcs were characterized by a southward shift in position and by a diminution in intensity with time before midnight. During the recovery phase of the storm, well-defined magnetic baylike disturbances occurred. The vairations in both position and brightness of the concurrent arc were strongly correlated with changes in the H and D components of these geomagnetic field deviations. An equivalent current system is determined from these baylike disturbance fields observed at twenty-six magnetic observatories for periods when the correlation was strongest. The current system found is similar to that of the DP 1 field, with a superimposed DP 2 field. The changes in these fields that are associated with the bayklie disturbances are presented to account for the transient variations observed in the intensity and position of the midlatitude auroral arc."
"In this paper, the backscattered electric field is derived when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident upon a perfectly conducting sphere coated with a radially inhomogeneous dielectric. The Mie series is obtained and then subjected to an asymptotic analysis that is valid for very short wavelengths. In particular, the first two terms for the reflected portion of the electric field are derived and the formulation for the creeping wave contribution is presented. Also, a numerical computation of the monostatic cross section is performed for various thicknesses of the coating by considering the reflected portion of the backscattered electric field. It is shown that this particular type of inhomogeneous sheath reduces considerably the monostatic cross section of the perfectly conducting sphere as its thickness increases."
"In scattering processes involving moving objects an exchange of electromagnetic and mechanical power takes place. The problem is considered for arbitrary objects in one, two, and three dimensions. It is shown that the energy balance depends on the scattering amplitude, evaluated at the frequency of excitation, on this frequency itself, and on the velocity in question. Three cases are considered: objects moving in free space, objects moving together with the surrounding medium, and objects moving through a medium, at rest with respect to the observer. An interesting result is the fact that objects moving in the direction of the incident wave cause a loss of electromagnetic energy smaller than the gain occurring when the objects move in the opposite direction. This is a first-order effect in the velocity."
"Recently a ray-optical procedure has been developed to determine the modes scattered by an obstacle in a homogeneously filled, perfectly conducting waveguide from knowledge of the free-space diffraction pattern ƒ(θ) of the obstacle. The present paper extends the procedure to two-dimensional waveguides or ducts filled with a weakly inhomogeneous medium and bounded by impedance walls. As in previous studies for simpler cases, the analysis deals initially with radiation from a nonisotropic line source with free-space radiation pattern ƒ(θ); it involves the ray-optical construction of the solution, ray-modal conversion, comparison with the asymptotic form of the rigorous solution for an isotropic source (ƒ(θ) = 1), and a semiheuristic modification to make the result applicable even to lower-order modes. While the method applies most directly to real rays and propagating modes, the result is extended subsequently to complex modes descriptive of evanescent, lossy, or leaky wave processes. Moreover, special attention is given to commonly ignored ray-optical phenomena associated with impedance boundaries. Application of the results is illustrated briefly by considering scattering due to a perfectly conducting strip obstacle located inside an inhomogeneous, lossless waveguide. Detailed calculations for this and other examples are to be presented in a future publication."
"The reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves by a semi-infinite moving plasma with a static magnetic field parallel to the moving direction are investigated for the incident H-plane wave. Numerical results for the reflection coefficient as functions of incident angle, velocity, frequency, and cyclotron frequency are given. It is shown that the moving anisotropic plasma exhibits several phenomena different from manifestations of the stationary case."

"The performance of total-power and balanced Dicke-type radiometers using digital integration is considered. The square-law device output is considered to be smoothed by an RC filter and then sampled. Degradation due to finite sampling rate and quantization noise is derived."
"We simultaneously measured atmospheric emission and absorption under clear sky conditions at frequencies of 15 and 35 GHz and compared the values with those calculated from the radiative transfer equation. The measurements show that atmospheric attenuation determined from emission and absorption measurements agree within experimental error and that the calculated values of attenuation agree with the measurements on a statistical basis when the Gross form factor is used with the model of a plane stratified atmosphere."
"Knowledge of the height integral of atmospheric refractivity (n — 1), where n is the refractive index, is essential for prediction of atmospheric range effect at any elevation angle. Observed values of the height integral for the lower, nonionized atmosphere can be obtained from weather balloon ascent data. Year-long collections of data from widely separated locations were used to relate this integral to surface data. Although (n — 1) at any point in a dry atmosphere depends on both pressure and temperature (the ratio P/T), the height integral of the observed dry part of (n — 1) is a linear function of surface pressure only, not of temperature. This is theoretically correct since P/T is equivalent to density, and the integral of density with height yields surface pressure. By application of this finding, the equivalent height for a (theoretically justified) quartic (n — 1) model (dry part) should be found to vary directly as surface temperature; the value obtained (least-squares fit to observed data) is 40.1 km for surface T = 0°C with a height expansion coefficient of 0.149 km per surface degree C. This would reduce the equivalent height to zero near 0° Kelvin. This theoretical model matches observed height integrals with an rms error of a few millimeters out of 2.3 meters (far less than 1%). Agreement between stations is excellent. A study of the more variable but much «mailer wet part is in progress. The wet part is significant at radio but not at optical frequencies."
"The development of a method for predicting monthly median values of the F1 layer penetration frequency (ƒ0F1) at any location and time is described. The expressions derived for predicting the monthly median ƒ0F1 are functions of the zenith angle of the sun, the ionospheric index IF2, and the geomagnetic latitude."
"In this paper, we examine the behavior of the coherent Green's function in a randomly fluctuating, unbounded, and statistically homogeneous medium. The starting point of the analysis is a ‘nonlinear’ approximation of the Dyson equation which has been pointed out by several investigators. Although exact solutions seem out of reach, owing to the inherent complexity of the problem, approximate solutions that are applicable in the limits of small and large-scale fluctuations can be obtained. The large-scale fluctuations are emphasized in this paper. Both one- and three-dimensional fluctuations are considered, and explicit calculations are made for the case in which an exponential correlation governs the refractive-index fluctuations. The solutions obtained are investigated in various limiting cases for which closed-form results are derived."
"Reflection of a vertically polarized electromagnetic plane wave from a periodic rough surface is considered. The surface is characterized locally by a boundary impedance. By using a perturbation analysis, we obtained expressions for the spectral components of the reflected waves. It is shown that the results at grazing incidence lead to an effective surface impedance that is consistent with an earlier analysis by Rice (1950) for a perfectly conducting sinusoidal surface."
"The high-frequency backscattered field produced by a plane electromagnetic wave at oblique incidence on a perfectly conducting, right circular cone with a flat base is considered. The first two terms of the asymptotic expansion are obtained by applying the geometrical theory of diffraction; these terms reduce to results derived earlier in the particular case of a circular disk. Owing to the axial caustic, functions must be introduced to match the wide-angle formulas to the known results for nose-on incidence. This matching is effected by employing Bessel functions and Fresnel integrals for the first- and second-order terms, respectively. The resulting expressions are valid for all cone angles and for a wide range of aspect angles about nose-on; they are also found to be in good agreement with experimental data."
"In this paper we consider the effect of element positioning errors on the pattern of a uniform linear array. An error in positioning each element in the longitudinal direction relative to the previous one is assumed to occur with a Gaussian distribution of zero mean and variance σ2. An important effect of this type of error is that although the main beam remains practically unchanged, there is a suppression of the grating lobes whose expected levels can be made less than the first sidelobe by increasing the number of elements and/or σ. In the sidelobe region, far from the mainlobe, the mean and variance of the pattern approach a constant whose value is inversely proportional to the number of elements. This permits one to use larger element spacings that give higher resolution without grating-lobe ambiguities. An example is given in connection with the mapping of two incoherent point sources. Expressions are derived and graphs are given for the mean and Standard deviation of the field pattern and for the mean and standard deviation of the power pattern. The theory was verified statistically by means of a computer that generated Gaussian random numbers. It also provided relative frequency histograms of power at the first grating lobe."
"We discuss here a computer program that has been developed for computation of the self and mutual admittances and of the radiation pattern of apertures on an infinite cylinder covered by an inhomogeneous lossy plasma. Numerical results are obtained and compared with equivalent results of apertures on a plasma-covered ground plane."
"An integral equation for cauculating the attenuation of radio waves propagating over irregular terrain is rederived. The integral equation is applied to three terrain profiles, and the solutions are compared with solutions obtained by using classical methods such as the residue series and diffraction theory."
"The parameters controlling the development of a simple model of the E and F regions of the ionosphere are discussed. Uses of such models in scientific investigations and engineering applications are given. A computer model is described that will provide estimates of the electron and ion densities in middle latitudes as a function of latitude, longitude, altitude, season, time, and solar activity. Statistical parameters for midlatitude blanketing sporadic E are presented. An analytic expression is used for the CIRA 1965 neutral atmospheric models. The Fi region is treated using a photoequilibrium model with three ionic constituents and 62 ionizing radiation groups. The F2 layer uses theoretical models arranged to fit boundary conditions of NmF2, HmF2 and the electron density at 1000 km. Values of NmF2 are obtained by using the CCIR atlas of ionospheric characteristics. The midlatitude sporadic E layer is treated by presenting three parameters of the layer: the probability of observing sporadic E with a blanketing frequency greater than 0.5 MHz, the average peak electron density when sporadic E is observed, and the standard deviation (assuming log normal distributions for the peak electron density). The restrictions on the model and the availability of data on suitable boundary conditions are discussed. Suggestions for further development of models of the ionosphere are given."
"By using a Chapman model and neglecting collisions, the maximum usable frequency (MUF) for whispering-gallery propagation under the E region is found to be about fifteen time the critical frequency. This value is some three times higher than the MUF for ground-to-ground communication. However, collisions cause serious attenuation of trapped whispering-gallery modes associated with the E region even at frequencies close to the MUF. Radio communication along the E-region whispering gallery, unlike communication along the F-region whispering gallery, is practical only for a distance of a few thousands of kilometers and is ineffective for propagation around the world."
"At frequencies above the maximum usable frequency for ground-to-ground ionospheric communication, propagation is possible between terminals located in the ionosphere. This phenomenon has been studied in the past by use of the ray theory and is treated in this paper by use of the mode theory. At a given HF frequency there are a number of modes that are well trapped and a number that leak profusely to the topside of the ionosphere. As the frequency is increased, the number of well trapped modes decreases. Ultimately, only one mode is reasonably well trapped and leakage even of this mode finally sets in. The frequency at which this happens determines the maximum usable frequency of the ionosphere for whispering-gallery propagation. By use of a Chapman model of ionospheric density, this frequency is calculated to be about six times the vertical penetration frequency for the F region. Mode theory shows that the whispering gallery associated with the F region can be used to explain both round-the-world echoes and long distance satellite observations."
"An arbitrary plane slab is considered within a magneto plasma whose parameters vary in a direction perpendicular to the (horizontal) plane of stratification, the plane of the slab faces. 2 × 2 reflection and transmission coefficient matrices are defined for the slab in terms of up-going waves incident from below, Ru and Tu, and in terms of downgoing waves incident from above, RD and TD. The matrix elements compare amplitudes of the wave fields of the characteristic magnetoionic modes, so normalized that in regions of negligible absorption the squares of the amplitudes are proportional to the mean Poynting vector. The theorem that is proved states that the matrix Tu is the transpose of the matrix TD and that the matrices Ru and RD are symmetric. Some applications are discussed."
"Nonlinear differential equations are derived for a plane, longitudinal steady-state wave propagating perpendicularly to a magnetic field in a thermal, collisional, weakly ionized plasma in the two-fluid approximation. They describe the variation along the propagation direction of the longitudinal electric field and the two components of velocity of each species. In the limit of small amplitude of oscillation, the equations lead to the dispersion relation obtained by Kato and Hirata (1967). Numerical solutions for various possible values of parameters in the ionospheric E layer are obtained with a computer. When the electron jet velocity is larger than the ion thermal velocity, primarily ion waves of a few tens of khz frequency and a few cm wavelength are obtained. The amplitude of the waves has a maximum value and it decays in the laboratory frame with an e-folding distance of a fraction of a meter. Radar backscatter observations (with metric wavelengths) seem to be from the envelope of the wave. The electric field of the maximum amplitude is 1–2 v/m, which is ∼105 times the microfield energy density and a few per cent of the kinetic energy density of the ion motion relative to the wave. It increases with wave velocity but not with electron jet velocity."
"Hourly averages of the H component of the low-latitude geomagnetic disturbance field are Fourier analyzed to obtain the amplitude G and local-time phase ϕ of the first diurnal harmonic for the one and one-half years of the IGY. The amplitude G is found to correlate roughly with the AE index and, in particular, to exhibit the same storm-time behavior. For major storms, G can exceed 100γ and, in the example shown, exceeds 80γ for an interval of six hours. The phase ϕ tends to be located near 1800 LT, and this characteristic is nearly independent of AE. A comparison of the observed phase and that associated with the usual bay return current suggests a two-component model of the disturbance field asymmetry, with one component at a non-bay orientation. The non-bay component is discussed in terms of possible ionospheric and magnetospheric currents. The second possibility seems to require currents located on the plasmapause to sustain the large forces involved in the asymmetry."
"The method of characteristics is applied to the study of transient electromagnetic wave propagation in a stratified plasma. The technique is applicable to lossy, anisotropic, time-varying plasmas whose parameters may vary in the direction of wave propagation. Numerical results demonstrate good agreement with theory."
"A solution is presented for the backscattered field of plane-wave pulse modulated carrier incident broadside on a low-density dielectric circular cylinder. The pulse return is expressed in terms of the inverse Laplace transform of the CW backscattered fields. Finite cylinders are considered with use of the infinite cylinder fields in an approximation."
"A capacitor that consists of four suitably spaced rings is considered for use as a reference standard and as the main element of a device for precise measurement of angle. In this capacitor, the mean of the two values of capacitance between the diagonally opposite rings is a second-order function of random variations of ring spacing and shape. This property promises good stability and leads to simplified construction. When used for angle measurement, a ratio of two capacitances defines the angle. This makes variations of supply voltages, temperature, humidity, and pressure of lesser concern. Possible applications are in the fields of astronomy, geodesy, space technology, and precision mechanics."
"A vector solution for electromagnetic wave scattering from a rough surface of arbitrary dielectric constant is developed through the use of the Stratton-Chu integral under the assumption that the horizontal extent of the surface irregularities (and possibly the vertical extent also) is large compared with the incident wavelength. Other assumptions implicit in this solution are that the incident wave is a plane wave of arbitrary polarization, that the observation point is at any arbitrary direction in the far field zone of the scattering surface, and that the rough surface can be represented by a stationary random process with normal height distribution and Gaussian correlation function, the mean value of the surface being a plane. For a rough surface of lossless dielectric, plots showing the effects of dielectric constant, angles of incidence and scattering, and the statistical parameters of the rough surface are presented for the special cases of backscattering and bistatic scattering in the plane of incidence. For bistatic scattering the scattering behavior near the Brewster angle is clearly shown; the results for backscattering indicate the need for a more general rough surface model incorporating surface structure both large and small with respect to the incident wavelength."
"Of the six barium releases made in Alaska in March 1969, two gave good amplitude data from the 4- to 64-MHz step-frequency radars installed near Kodiak and Homer, Alaska. The effective cross section for isotropic scatter exceeded 1000 km2, whereas the projected area of the cloud was less than 100 km2, this indicates that the scatter was directive, not isotropic. The echoes were found to have an aspect sensitivity of 10 to 20 decibels per degree of off-perpendicularity from the magnetic field. The backscatter cross section apparently had a maximum in the 15-to 30-MHz range; this indicates that transverse irregularity sizes of 5 to 10 meters were dominant in the clouds. At early times the length of the irregularities was of the order of a kilometer. Pronounced optical striation was accompanied by a decrease in aspect sensitivity; no other correlation was found between the optical and radar data. This indicates that the changes affecting the radar cross section were invisible. When all the available radio data are considered, the cloud at early times acts as if it were an over-dense ball (not necessarily spherical) embedded in a field-aligned cloud that is thin perpendicular to the direction of ion drift and that contains weak-scattering field-aligned irregularities. After striation the cloud acts as if it were a group of weak-scattering, field-aligned irregularities. The radar behavior of the clouds appears to be strongly dependent on ionospheric conditions."
"During the period July 1967 to July 1968 about 60 shortwave fade-outs, both weak and strong, were observed at Lindau through simultaneous use of several shortwave paths particularly established for absorption measurements. The frequencies used were 2.50, 2.614, 2.775, and 6.09 MHz; the distance between transmitter and receiver was about 300 km. Moreover, a riometer was used with a comer reflector antenna directed at the polestar (27.6 MHz). For the quoted shortwave fade-outs the Naval Research Laboratory made available stored data of solar X-ray flux in minute intervals; the data were obtained from satellites OGO 4 and Solrad 9 in the wavelength ranges 0.5–3, 1–8, 8–20, and 44–60 Å. The analysis of the various effects shows that there is a very good correlation between the enhancements of solar X-ray flux and the enhancements of ionospheric absorption. The beginning and maximum of the shortwave fade-outs are delayed by 0.5 to 4 minutes in relation to the beginning and maximum of the bursts, with the longer delay corresponding to the shorter wavelength. The end of the effects cannot be determined so definitely; the time differences between bursts and shortwave fade-outs vary between ±7 minutes. Usually, the trend and detail of the shortwave fade-outs very nearly follow the trend of the burst; thus, bursts may be considered equivalent to shortwave fade-outs. For a number of very clear weaker effects the additional absorption ΔL has been found to be proportional to the additional flux ΔXE. For a very strong effect after a saturation ΔL increases again. The relative maximums of absorption ΔL/L during shortwave fade-outs are proportional to the relative enhancement of flux ΔXE/XE."
"The effectiveness of a dipole source within the ionosphere is determined relative to a ground based source of the same dipole moment. The earth-to-ionospheric cavity is excited best if dip angles of the geomagnetic field are in excess of 15° to 20°. In the optimum orientation the axes of electric and magnetic dipoles are transverse to the geomagnetic field; axial electric dipoles are particularly ineffective. For frequencies in the VLF range the relative effectiveness of an ionospheric source is about 10% at nighttime and 1% at daytime. In the ELF range the relative effectiveness is from 20 to 100%."
"Coherent phase-modulated signals at 50 and 423 MHz are transmitted from Stanford University to specially equipped spacecraft orbiting the sun. Differential group delay and phase advance are measured; each of these parameters is approximately proportional to the average electron number density along the signal path. The experimental method enables us to discriminate between temporal and spatial variations of the solar wind by virtue of inherent spatial averaging. During the past 4.5 years, 10,000 hours of these data have been obtained from Pioneers 6, 7, 8, and 9 and Mariner 5. At times, measurements have been taken for two periods each day, by the use of first one spacecraft ahead of earth and then one behind. With such a technique, corotating flow patterns are clearly visible. Hourly samples are presented of the best data that were obtained by Pioneers 8 and 9 during the two-year period ending in February 1970. The density patterns reveal corotating regions in each of which a recognizable character is maintained during several rotations but for less than a year. This result is in contrast to results of other observers, who have seen corotating features lasting up to 1.5 years. The short duration observed here may be due to noisiness in these data or it may be typical of the active sun, whereas a longer duration is typical of quiet times. The observed density patterns are not consistent with the concept of steady corotating flows because large transients occur too fast and because identifiable features recur with nearly (but not exactly) the same period on successive rotations of the sun. These patterns could be a result of the corotation of thin steady streams that fluctuate both north-south and east-west by distances well in excess of the cross-sectional extent of the streams. It is also possible (and more likely) that the data indicate some corotating regions in which the solar wind is featureless and of low density and other regions characterized by high density and the prevalence of outward traveling plasma disturbances."
"The propagation of whistler energy in slight enhancements or depressions of ionization aligned with the geomagnetic field has been studied earlier in the two limiting cases of a discontinuous boundary or very slowly varying density gradients. These two approaches have yielded different results, particularly for the trapping of energy in enhancements of ionization. Therefore a study of the reflection and transmission for the full range of gradients is desirable. In this paper, full-wave methods are applied to bell shaped ducts of arbitrary scale size. The results indicate criteria for applicability of the two simplifying limiting cases. This phase of the study is further extended by examination of a coupling theory. For a variety of magnetospheric conditions the cross-coupling terms between characteristically different waves are negligible; this leads to almost perfect reflection and substantiates the use of the simpler phase-integral techniques. By using the phase integral techniques, we have derived a fairly complete description of possible modes excited in bell shaped ducts. For each mode a theoretical whistler spectrogram is obtained. Extensions of the theory to apply to nonuniform magnetic fields may lead to predictions of a hyper-fine whistler structure."
"In this work it is shown that the diagrams that correspond to the first renormalization equation for the coherent field, in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic medium, are the dominant diagrams. To study the cumulative effect of the omitted diagrams, which increase in number with each power of the expansion parameter e, we sum the next largest omitted diagrams. This sum is proportional to the propagation path length times the usual first renormalization solution. The above analysis and a more compact one that utilizes the full Dyson equation both yield a validity criterion that is basically distance independent. The derivation of the validity criterion is primarily based on two observations that are not used by other authors. First we note and account for the fact that the solution of the first renormalization integral equation is always approximated. Secondly, we utilize the simple observation that phase accumulation and rate of decay are unimportant if the amplitude of the wave is already insignificant. We obtain the same criterion as other authors for k0l » 1, where k0 is the free space wave number and l is the correlation length of the dielectric fluctuations; for k0l « 1 the criterion is new. Finally, a relatively simple method of solving the first renormalization integral equation for the correlation function of the field is presented for the case k0l » 1 and some justification for the validity of this equation is given."
"A method is given to evaluate the input impedance of cylindrical and helical antennas immersed in cold lossy magnetoplasma. The impedance is shown to split into the sum of three terms associated, respectively, with the longitudinal current component, the circumferential current component, and the interaction between the two components of current. The procedure involves use of an assumed current density distribution for which necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained in order that the impedance will be finite for all frequencies including those for which there are refractive-index resonances. The method is applied to obtain extensive numerical results for a specific choice of current distribution for the special case when the antenna is aligned parallel to the static magnetic field. Indications of the sensitivity of the results to choice of current distribution for cylindrical antennas (longitudinal current only) are obtained by comparison of the present numerical results with numerical results in the literature based on other current distributions."
"Wave propagation in a one-fluid compressible, inhomogeneous, and lossy plasma is studied. Coupling between the electroacoustic and electromagnetic waves is investigated analytically. The inhomogeneity of the medium is due to the variation of the electron density, collision frequency, and temperature along the vertical direction only (z direction). An E polarized electromagnetic wave is assumed to be incident from a vacuum to a slowly varying, inhomogeneous, compressible, and lossy plasma occupying the half space defined by z > 0. Among the various possible boundary conditions at z = 0 that involve the electroacoustic fields, the vanishing of the pressure at z = 0 is chosen so that the numerical computation becomes relatively simple. The profiles of the electron density, the collision frequency, and the temperature are chosen so that they are consistent with this type of boundary condition. The numerical results presented here show the dependence of the coupling characteristics (i.e., the transfer of energy from em waves to p waves) on the various plasma parameters and other parameters. Conditions for the validity of the perturbation method are examined and are proved to be satisfied for the problem."

"The ‘equivalent circuit method' of deriving electric currents in the ionosphere from assumed values of conductivities and emf's has been described earlier. The ionosphere is represented as a large circuit network, with the Hall effect included, and this network is solved by an iterative procedure on a computer. A single tidal wind system, the ‘1, —2’ mode, is used as the driving force of the dynamo. The winds are converted from the geographic to the geomagnetic coordinate system. The international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF) is used to provide magnetic field values for calculating the dynamo emf's and the conductivities. The agreement between the calculated and observed positions of the focuses of the current system is remarkable when we consider that no seasonal variation of the wind was included. Seasonal variations of the reversal times of the equatorial electrojet are obtained in rough agreement with observation, whereas the calculated variations of the intensity of the electrojet do not agree so well."
"It is shown that time-structure analysis of geomagnetic crochets can be useful in the ground-based detection of XUV radiation from solar flares. The crochets often manifest a composite structure that consists of a ‘fast’ component presumably produced by EUV radiation (100–1000 Å) and a ‘slow’ component produced by soft X rays (1–100Å). This composite structure is taken into account in the proposed method of analysis for crochet current systems. Some preliminary results are given from the simulation studies of Sq and crochet current systems. These studies are intended to probe into the nature of the atmospheric winds that drive the ionospheric dynamo and that generate both the Sq and crochet currents."
"A quiet time galactic component, Gq, of the geomagnetic field variations has been extracted from observatory data of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Honolulu, Hawaii, for the quiet sun years of 1965 and 1966. In the search for this effect, days of active solar-terrestrial disturbances were excluded, and the contributions of the solar quiet current (Sq) and the lunar tidal current (L) were first removed. Nighttime data show the Gq most effectively as a 1.5-gamma variation that is diurnal in H with an increase at about 2200 sidereal time (SiT). The D and Z sidereal variations are less clear in the present data sample."
"The elements of the magnetic field of the currents induced in the earth by an external magnetic field whose distribution is supposed to be known numerically are found in terms of the corresponding elements of the external field. The conductivity of the earth is represented by a uniformly conducting shell of radius qa (q < 1). When the conductivity of the shell is assumed infinite, these relations are Zi(P) = —q3Ze(P') and Hi(P) = q3He(P') — (1/qa2) ∫0q2a rHe(r) dr, where Z and H are the vertical and vector horizontal components, P is a point on the earth's surface, P' is a point on the same radius as P and at distance q2a from the earth's center, and r is the radius vector from the center of the earth. When the conductivity of the shell is taken as finite, a correction to the above formulas is given. The formulas are useful in comparing the observed distribution at the surface of the earth with what is to be expected from an external current system, when the effects of induction in the earth are taken into account."
"Tidal winds excited by thermal or gravitational forces propagate into ionospheric altitudes and generate currents by dynamo action. The vertical and horizontal structure of these winds is altered by various dissipative forces which gain importance at these altitudes. In this paper, the dissipative effects of the Lorentz force, molecular viscosity, and molecular heat conductivity are considered in terms of a perturbation treatment. Both the rotation and the sphericity of the earth are explicitly taken into account. For propagating tidal modes, the dissipative effects are found to reduce and reverse the amplitude growth with height predicted by dissipationless tidal theory. Quantitative differences are obtained between the behavior of tides on a rotating earth and of internal gravity waves of comparable frequencies and vertical wavelengths on a non-rotating earth."
"Hourly measurements of the blanketing frequency of sporadic E (fbEs) made during the years 1958 through 1965 have been analyzed for lunar daily variations. The data, which came from ten stations, were analyzed by the Chapman-Miller method. Both seasonal and yearly average lunar variations were obtained. The lunar semidiurnal oscillations in fbEs, ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 MHz, with maximums occurring from 7 to 9 hours lunar time. The amplitude of the lunar tide in fbEs, is an order of magnitude less than the lunar variations of fbEs. Since fbEs is close to the plasma frequency of Es, the oscillation in fbEs, represents a lunar variation in the electron density of E, layers, whereas the significance of the lunar variation of fbEs, is not clear. The phases of the lunar tides in fbEs, fbEs, and h'Es are found to be nearly the same. Two sources of lunar influence on Es electron density are considered (1) wind shears in the lunar tide acting to augment or decrease the wind shears responsible for Es, and (2) interaction of Es with electrostatic fields associated with the lunar current system."
"For the lower F2 layer very near the dip equator it is assumed that vertical electromagnetic drift is important but that other contributions to the divergence of the ionospheric plasma are not. By also assuming constant scale heights and by making other usual approximations, a continuity equation is obtained that can be solved in terms of tabulated transcendental functions, for both day and night. It is shown that these solutions fit very well to electron density profiles measured by the incoherent scatter technique near the dip equator; this fit suggests that the assumptions and approximations are suitable. From these fittings, reasonable estimates of the rates of photo-ionization and recombination are obtained."
"At midlatitudes, vertical transport of ionization in the topside F region results from three mechanisms: first, ambipolar diffusion along the magnetic field, second, interaction between the ionization and the wind in the neutral atmosphere, and third, E × B drifts perpendicular to the magnetic field. The vertical velocity resulting from these three mechanisms was measured by determining the Doppler shift in the Thomson-scattered power spectrum at altitudes between 450 and 900 km (Evans et al., 1970). Drift measurements were made at Millstone Hill Ionospheric Observatory. Electron-density profiles and electron- and ion-temperature profiles were made also. Drifts for the 24-hour period of September 11–12, 1968, are examined for an altitude of 450 km. The diffusion velocity is calculated from the electron density and the thermal structure; the ion temperature at 300 km is taken as the neutral gas temperature for determination of the atomic oxygen density. With this diffusion velocity calculated and the vertical velocity measured, the combined effect of interaction with the neutral winds and E × B drifts can be determined. Through use of a model of the diurnal neutral wind behavior (Cho and Yeh, 1970), the effective E × B drift in the topside F region is estimated at midlatitudes. East-west electric fields in the dynamo region that generate such E × B drifts are calculated from these results."
"In a partially ionized gas, if electrons and ions have a relative drift Vd perpendicular to a static B field, Farley and Buneman have shown that an electrostatic wave with propagation vector K perpendicular to B and wavelength λ ≥ 0.375 meter will be unstable if K•Vd/K exceeds the ion thermal speed. We have extended Farley's calculation for K perpendicular to B by the following procedure. First, we examine modes of higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. Second, we retain the term K2λDE2 (λDE is the electron Debye length), since this term cannot be neglected for short wavelength modes. This makes the dispersion relation density dependent. Third, we obtain plots of growth rate versus frequency for various values of K•Vd/K. With the use of the Culler-Fried on-line computer system, the dispersion relation has been solved numerically by contour integration. There are four results of the numerical calculation. First, there is an electron density threshold for excitation of higher frequency modes. Second, for a fixed electron density of 3.5 × 105/cm2, the fastest growing mode shifts to higher frequency as K•Vd/K increases. For K•Vd/K equal to three times the ion thermal speed, 3ar, the fastest growing mode oscillates at ωr ∼ 0.7(ΩEΩl)1/2 where ΩE and Ωl are electron and ion cyclotron frequencies. The frequency ωr is far above those calculated by Farley. Third, the same behavior cited above is also exhibited for fixed K•Vd/K but increasing electron density. Fourth, modes with oscillating frequency ωr ∼ (ΩEΩl)1/2 can be excited for K•Vd/K ≥ 2.3al and current density greater than 1.0 × 10−5 amp/m2. These are reasonable values for the equatorial electrojet and the auroral electrojet in the ionosphere during disturbed times."
"An exact longitudinal wave solution of nonlinear equations for a cold and collisionless one-fluid magneto plasma has been obtained. The wave is found to be anharmonic (nonsinusoidal) in form and its amplitude involves an arbitrary parameter. By means of a pseudo-potential well, the domain of nonlinear oscillations is defined and the maximum amplitude up to which a nonlinear wave can grow is determined. Intensity of the equatorial sporadic-E irregularities is computed and the coherent energy density is found to be of the order of 10−9 erg/cm3."
"A weakly ionized plasma with gradients in the ionization density under the influence of the crossed electric and magnetic fields is subject to a unique type of plasma instability called the cross-field or E×B instability. This paper examines by means of a linear analysis the relevance of such an instability mechanism to the formation of the field aligned columns of enhanced ionization or striations in the artificially generated plasma clouds in the upper atmosphere. A Gaussian model for the electron density distribution in the cloud and the electric fields that have been derived from the ion and neutral cloud drift motions have been used in computing the characteristic parameters, which are the minimum wavelength λmin and the e-folding growth time τ for the instability. A brief comparison has shown good agreement between the computed instability model and the observed striation formation in one of the high latitude Barium releases conducted in Alaska during March 1969 (test hemlock of Secede III series). Some general results that show the dependence of the instability parameters on the height of the release and cloud dimension are also presented."
"Two Skylark rockets were launched from the range of the European Space Research Organization (ESRO) near Kiruna on February 14, 1970, at 17.15 CET and on April 2 at 02.46 for investigation of electric fields. Each rocket carried an electric double-probe experiment, a Langmuir probe, an experiment to detect the influence of the plasma drift on the wake of the rocket, a Geiger-Müller counter, and finally a barium cloud experiment. Three of these (double-probe, wake experiment, and barium cloud) provided independent information on the ambient electric field. The present paper deals with the initial results of these three electric field experiments. In the first flight, which took place under slightly disturbed conditions (+40 γ), all methods indicated a roughly northerly field of about 22 mv/m. In the second flight (under quiet conditions), a southerly field between 3 and 6 mv/m was observed by the different experiments. The direction of the plasma drift derived from the measured orientation of the wake of the rocket agrees within 10° with that derived from the double-probe results and the barium cloud observations. Estimates of electron density and temperature were obtained from the operation of the double-probe system in different modes. These electron density values were in good agreement with those derived from the ionosonde data and from the Langmuir-probe data."
"In order to interpret VHF aurora backscatter communications, it is necessary to get some information about the extent, the movement, and the strength of the polar electrojet. In this paper a method is given to calculate an equivalent current system in the polar E region by determining the unknown parameters (height, direction, width of the current, etcetera) from the measured disturbance vectors of the earth's magnetic field, ΔH, ΔD, and ΔZ. With a model of a simple current-density distribution it is possible to solve the Biot-Savart formula. The consideration of positive, negative, and induced currents leads to a system of nonlinear equations of eight unknown parameters in this special instance. With an iterative method given by Newton and Raphson this system of equations can be solved if approximate values of the solution are known. These approximate values are given by physical conditions or can be obtained by model calculation. In this paper, results are shown for a current system calculated with values of ΔH, ΔD, and ΔZ from the magnetograms of Leirvogur, Lerwick, Eskdalemuir, and Hartland during a period of about five hours on March 23–24, 1969."
"The ionospheric absorption detected by five-riometer arrays and the concurrent magnetometer records from Great Whale River, Canada, and Byrd, Antarctica, were studied during mildly active periods of August 23, 1966, and April 24, 1967. Through use of the four methods of absorption gradient variation, correlated absorption region, triangulated current, and field pulsation patterns, evidence of hourly change in apparent conjugate location was sought. The riometer data showed analogous changes in the two hemispheres but rather random variations in conjugate position. The field pulsation patterns were not interpretable. The relative north-south position of the auroral electrojets from the two stations indicated a regular change in the outer magnetosphere, which probably caused a variation in the conjugate location."
"For polar magnetic substorms, the two-dimensional current system in the ionosphere and the three-dimensional systems including the field-aligned currents in the magnetosphere, are conjectured; both systems have the same geomagnetic effect on the ground but a different effect in and above the ionosphere. The intense westward electrojet along the auroral zone, or oval, is concluded to be mainly the Hall current in the ionosphere, and this is always accompanied by the field-aligned current system in the meridional plane with a north-south current segment in the ionosphere. The direction of current flow in the meridional plane depends on the mechanism of its production, whether it is of ionospheric origin or of magnetospheric origin. Recent rocket and satellite measurements of the magnetic field in and above the ionosphere indicate the presence of both these conditions."
"The asymmetry of the equatorial ring-current and its progressive change during magnetic storms are studied by introducing the new DR indices, which contain the following four parameters: 1, intensity of symmetric ring-current, 2, intensity of partial ring-current, 3, local time of the center of the partial ring-current, and 4, longitudinal width of the partial ring-current."
"After a short discussion of the dynamo theory for producing electric current systems for 5, and L variations, results of mapping these dynamo-region electrostatic fields into the magnetosphere are briefly presented. The mapped electrostatic fields, together with the earth's main magnetic field, produce drift motions of magnetospheric plasma particles. Using the same but reversed mapping procedure, magnetospheric electrostatic field effects on the dynamo region are discussed. Highly localized geomagnetic variations during relatively quiet periods can be explained by this effect. Also a possibility of producing Sq-type electric currents in the dynamo region by the magnetospheric electrostatic fields caused by motions in the plasmasphere is examined. This magnetospheric effect on Sq, may be greater than other effects due to magnetospheric electric currents (such as magnetopause, tail, and quiet-ring currents). It is concluded that future direct measurements of electrostatic fields (or electrostatic drifts) may determine which of the two mechanisms (dynamo action or plasmaspheric motions) is the major cause of the production of the ionospheric Sq, current system, although the dynamo action seems to be the main cause of L variation."
"Satellite measurements of the magnetic field B in the earth's tail indicate the existence of electric currents flowing inside the tail but outside the so-called ‘current’ or ‘neutral’ sheet. The Imp 3 data indicate that the density of these currents, although not insignificant, is smaller than the current density inside the ‘neutral’ sheet. Preliminary discussion of the effect of the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field Bi on the tail geometry is presented. The ‘neutral’ sheet is systematically displaced northward if the polarity of Bi is positive (i.e., if Bi has a component directed away from the sun), but its average position is close to the plane Z = 0 if the polarity of B (is negative. ((X, Y, Z) is the standard solar magnetospheric coordinate system.) The tail structure outside the ‘neutral’ sheet is not symmetric with respect to the plane Z = 0, even if the geomagnetic latitude of subsolar point (χ) is close to zero; i.e., the magnetic field in the part of the magnetotail where the X component of B is antiparallel to the X component of Bi is smaller than in the other part of the tail."
"A possible mechanism for the formation of electron density irregularities in the magnetosphere is examined quantitatively. The mechanism involves localized E × B convection cells in which tubes of ionization with different total content are mixed. Under reasonable initial conditions, it is shown that a 0.1-mv/m electric field in the equatorial plane can produce electron density enhancements and depressions of the order of 5% at L = 4 in about one-half hour. These enhancements are large enough to trap whistler waves, whereas the depressions can trap HF waves. It is also shown that small-scale density irregularities can be produced by a much larger scale electric field. It is suggested that thundercloud electricity may be a possible source of the electric field responsible for the irregularities."
"Large increases in the low energy electron fluxes (0.5 to 50 kev) are observed to occur at synchronous altitude on most nights in the local evening or midnight sectors. These increases are usually found to be associated with magnetic substorms. The time of increase in the fluxes is found to be energy dependent, with the lower energy electrons nearly always being observed first for the evening and midnight events. If one interprets these flux increases as resulting from an inward convection of the plasma sheet in connection with a substorm, one can estimate the convection velocity at synchronous altitude from the measured energy dependent time of flux increase and earlier measurements [Vasyliunas, 1968; Schield and Frank, 1970; Frank, 1970] of the energy dependent radial structure of the inner edge of the plasma sheet The median velocity estimated from 38 cases by this technique is approximately 3 km/sec. This implies a westward electric field of approximately 0.36 mv/m, a value consistent with other measurements of this field."
"By the addition of an interplanetary magnetic field in various orientations to a closed magnetosphere model, the Dungey model was generated for all orientations other than a strictly northward interplanetary magnetic field. Particles can be accelerated in both the dayside magnetopause current sheet and in the tail current sheet, but there are inherent asymmetries. Particles may have asymmetric access to the north or the south polar caps, depending on the interplanetary field orientation. The breakdown of the usual adiabatic theory is discussed for a model current sheet."
"A heuristic model of the geomagnetic cavity is introduced. The model includes a unipolar induction current Ju, that is driven by the solar wind. The current is generated by the solar wind plasma flowing in the magnetopause boundary layer. This current closes in the ionosphere. The electromagnetic forces associated with Ju drive the magnetospheric convection. Even though the solar wind plasma at the magnetopause is basically collisionless, the plasma penetrates more deeply into the geomagnetic cavity than it would if the magnetopause were an ideal Chapman-Ferraro sheath because the boundary layer flow is non-adiabatic in the regions where Ju is nonzero. Downstream from the earth the resulting expanded boundary layer forms the plasma sheet and the geomagnetic tail. Since the generation of Ju does not depend on the existence of an interplanetary magnetic field, the geomagnetic cavity is closed when the interplanetary field is zero. The tangential drag is developed in the part of the boundary layer that lies forward of the midnight-meridian intersection of the leading edge of the neutral sheet. The tail is produced by the inflation of the downstream part of the modified cavity that is formed by the superposition of the geomagnetic field and the magnetic field of Ju. Transient phenomena produced by changes in Ju include substorm expansions and injections of ring current particles which are initiated by decreases in Ju. Changes in Ju are caused by changes in the solar wind velocity (i.e., by changes in the unipolar emf) and by changes in the effective resistance to the flow of Ju. If there is a critical value of |Ju| above which the current is unstable, then there is a corresponding critical magnitude of the unipolar emf and therefore of the solar wind velocity. Such an instability in Ju would account for the positive correlation between solar wind velocity and Kp. When the interplanetary magnetic field is greater than zero, shear stresses are set up between the solar wind plasma in the magnetopause boundary layer and that in the magnetosheath. The unipolar induction, i.e., the unipolar emf, and the resulting tangential drag then depend on the direction and magnitude of the interplanetary field as well as on the velocity of the solar wind and the electrical (Pedersen) resistivity of the magnetospheric plasma. The many attractive features of the model, especially the simplicity of the tangential drag mechanism, suggest that unipolar induction is a competitive alternative to magnetic field line reconnection and the other mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the tangential drag on the cavity and the various transient cavity phenomena."
"The reflection of a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave by an idealized cold-plasma ionosphere model, with a constant vertical magnetic field, is examined. A linear electron density profile and a constant collision frequency are assumed. For vertical incidence, the exact time-harmonic solution for the parallel and cross-polarized reflected fields are expressible in terms of Airy functions. Then, using a numerical inverse Fourier transform, the impulse response of the model is obtained. It is shown that causality is satisfied for both the in-polarized and the cross-polarized component of the reflected transient wave. The cross-polarized component owes its existence to the presence of the dc magnetic field."
"It is shown that the electric fields that can exist in the auroral and equatorial ionospheres should produce a convergent flow of metallic ions. It is suggested that this convergent flow of ions is responsible for some of the sporadic E with high ƒbEa observed in these regions. It is further suggested that the existence of meridional currents in the equatorial ionosphere might be detected by their production of sporadic E, whereas in the auroral ionosphere the direction of the electric field and the molecular weight of the ions responsible for the Es layer can be found from height measurements and the separation between the striations in the sporadic layer."
"Diurnal changes in F2 ionization distribution as measured during June and July 1966 over the Tamanrasset meridian reveal two types of asymmetric phenomena distorting the crest-and-trough system (formerly known as the equatorial F2 ionization anomaly). The first type corresponds to a general time variation of the latitude asymmetry. Our observations yield four independent parameters of this asymmetry; for 80% of the time, the variation can be attributed to ion drag due to a time-varying meridian air wind. Magnetic activity is correlated with the amplitude of this wind, and the low-altitude thermospheric circulation is discussed. Day-to-day fluctuations of the diurnal evolution pattern suggest a possible long-term control of the equatorial electric field by the general dynamo current system. A second type of asymmetry shows more intense, local, and short-lived phases superimposed on the fountain and neutral wind fluctuations. It has the character of a transitory forced-diffusion process. We believe that the factor responsible is electron temperature gradients produced by conjugate photoelectron heating."
"Measurements of the intensities of plasma lines in the radar incoherent-scatter spectrum are reported. The measurements were performed with the UHF radar at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts, on February 9, 1969. Theory of the plasma lines is reviewed, and problems of data interpretation are discussed. The plasma-line intensities are interpreted in terms of photoelectron upward and downward flux components at 560 km. The net upward flux there is found to be 3.6 × 108 cm−2 sec−1. From the measured fluxes and a simplified picture of photoelectron transport, the escape flux and the arriving conjugate-point flux are found. In addition, the opacity of the protonospheric field tube connecting Millstone Hill and its conjugate point is estimated as 0.85 for photoelectrons."
"This paper describes a laboratory investigation of two types of dipolar RF admittance probes which could be of use in the ionosphere and inner magnetosphere. Simple theoretical models are presented, using the quasi-static approximation and vacuum sheath. Independent accurate measurements of both the electron density and temperature are made, using Langmuir probes and the dispersion properties of Bernstein waves, and the results are compared with the RF probe predictions. In general, good agreement is obtained, indicating both the usefulness of the probes as a way of measuring electron densities in space and the applicability of the model used. These results also give an estimate of the effective sheath thickness around the probe, which is smaller than previous measurements have suggested."
"An analytical solution for radiation from a truncated parallel-plate waveguide into a dielectric or plasma slab is obtained by solving the Hilbert problem associated with a certain singular integral equation. The technique has the advantage that the edge condition is easily shown to be satisfied, and numerical results can be obtained with excellent accuracy. Numerical results are presented for a variety of dielectric and plasma slabs, parallel-plate separations, and aperture-to-slab distances."
"A comparison is given of Keller's method, renormalization techniques, and approximations commonly employed in obtaining approximate solutions to the exact Dyson equation for the coherent field. It is shown that the Dyson equation, Keller's method, and the renormalization theory all lead to identical results. It is also shown that the Dyson equation is the most convenient since it is inherently free of unconnected (factorizable) diagrams."
"We solve for the fields in a waveguide with finitely conducting walls by a singular perturbation technique. The method provides a systematic procedure for finding higher-order terms in the solution and also yields insight into the effects of conductivity on a waveguide whose cross section has degenerate eigenvalues. The problem is formulated in terms of the Hertz potential with the guide excited by an electric vector polarized longitudinally (TM case). Since the equations are similar for the case of the guide excited by a magnetic vector polarized longitudinally (TE case), the method developed may be easily extended to include that case."
"The reflection of a transient plane wave from a grating of thin conducting cylinders is considered. The inverse Fourier transform of the known steady-state solution is performed both analytically and numerically. Both impulse and step function excitations are treated explicitly. Expressions for the scattered fields are obtained that are useful for either large or small time. It was found that a simple decaying exponential function of time is a fairly good approximation for the waveform of the induced current in the grating."
"Analytical expressions are derived for the resistance of a finite loop with a uniform current distribution located above a lossy half-space. For loops of radii p0 large relative to the skin depth δ of the lossy medium, the resistance remains the same as for a long, straight, horizontal wire. For p0 much less than δ, the loop resistance is proportional to the square of (p0/δ). Numerical solutions show that the above formulas are not valid under conditions of nonuniform loop current at loop elevations h that are a small fraction of δ. The resistance expressions of a magnetic dipole are obtained only in the limit of h » δ."
"Both electric and magnetic fields are shown to be present for charged particles at rest in bianisotropic media. A bianisotropic medium can be realized by a moving medium, a Tellegen medium, or a magnetoelectric medium. The coexistence of both fields may lead to radiation of energy for certain kinds of constitutive parameters that specify the properties of the medium. Electromagnetic field solutions of a charged particle in a Tellegen medium and a uniformly moving uniaxial medium are calculated. Physical implications of the various results are discussed."
"The group-theoretic consistency of a random variable scaling law implies that the associated spectrum function is proportional to a power of the frequency."
"An expression is derived for the difference between the atmospheric refractive index calculated from the monthly averages of pressure, dry bulb temperature, and vapor pressure and as the average of the corresponding daily values. It is shown that the order of differences between them is negligible. The orders of errors introduced in the computed values of refractive index by rounding off the temperature and the pressure values to the nearest integral values are shown to be 2 to 3 N units."
"The addition of phase difference measurements to differential absorption experiments is shown to be both feasible and desirable. The phase information can provide a more sensitive measurement of electron density above about 75 km. The differential phase shift is only weakly dependent on collision frequency in this range, and so an accurate collision frequency profile is not a prerequisite. The differential phase shift and differential absorption measurements taken together can provide both electron density and collision frequency data from about 70 to 90 km."
"One particular backscatter signature obtained with an HF narrow-beam scan backscatter sounder system is analyzed by considering its behavior statistics and applying a three-dimensional computer ray-tracing technique. Other simultaneous radio data are used to modify the theoretical model. Results of this investigation indicate that this particular signature probably is the result of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances which are the ionospheric manifestations of internal atmospheric gravity waves."
"This note deals with the measurement of the total electron content of the ionosphere at the Goddard Space Flight Center, looking towards the geostationary satellite ATS 3 during the solar eclipse of March 7, 1970. Obscuration at this site was nearly total. Faraday rotation was measured with a stationary circularly polarized antenna and a dual-channel phase-lock receiver tuned to 137.350 MHz. By comparing the electrical phase of the two opposite circularly polarized components, a continuous chart recording was made of Faraday rotation versus local time. A depletion of about 25% in electron content was observed from first contact to the time of minimum electron content. The time variations of the electron content during the eclipse are briefly examined in the light of current theories of ionospheric processes."
"The expression for the total power radiated by an electron moving in a helical path was derived from Schwinger's general equation for synchrotron radiation. The equation derived was used to predict the synchrotron radiation from incoming auroral electrons at three different stations, one in the auroral zone and the other two at midlatitudes. The results of the calculations for the station in the auroral zone agree with the data observed by Parthasarathy and Berkey at College, Alaska. The synchrotron radiation from the incoming auroral electrons indeed offers an explanation for the observations of auroral noise observed at College, Alaska."
"An infinite line source or current-carrying cable on the surface of a flat homogeneous earth is considered. The integral formula, for the case of negligible displacement currents, is reduced either to tabulated functions or to a form suitable for numerical integration. A table of numerical values of these basic integrals is presented. We also show that, in principle, the relative location of the line source can be deduced from measurements of the subsurface field The results have possible application to mine rescue operations."
"The radiation of Hertzian dipoles (vertical electric and magnetic and horizontal electric and magnetic) with impulsive currents in the presence of a nondispersive dielectric half-space is considered. By taking the inverse Fourier transform of the Sommerfeld integrals, exact closedform solutions are obtained for particular locations of source and observation points. These solutions contain doublet and delta singularities whose magnitudes and arrival times are determined by geometrical optics followed by smoothly decaying waveforms whose final values are determined by static theory."
"Two different but equivalent multipole methods are applied to the problem of determining the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a perfectly conducting cylinder over a dielectric half-space. Numerical results are presented for different sets of parameter values. The results seem to be in good agreement with those obtained by geometrical optics methods for the high-frequency case, and qualitative results can be obtained by a relatively simple procedure based on geometrical optics."
"The geometrical theory of diffraction has been applied to analysis of the backscattered fields of a cube in the plane normal to four edges of the cube. The results of this diffraction analysis are used to calculate the backscattered fields at harmonically related frequencies, which are then combined with experimental data and transformed to obtain impulse, step, and ramp responses in the time domain. The inclusion of the calculated high-frequency data results in a more precise determination of the time-response waveforms than is possible with only low-frequency measured data. As an example of the results, the impulse, step, and ramp responses for vertical and horizontal polarization are presented for θ = 0° (specular direction), 30°."
"The radiation field of dipoles or small apertures on a perfectly conducting sphere has been examined analytically with the aid of the dyadic Green's function technique. The patterns of four symmetrically located sources (dipoles or small apertures) on the sphere have been calculated to illustrate the diffraction phenomena due to spheres of various dimensions."
"The characteristic equation is derived for the propagation of surface waves guided by a planar two-dimensional corrugated structure. This equation is solved numerically to obtain the propagation wave number as a function of the direction of propagation on the surface. The data obtained illustrate the anisotropic nature of the wave propagation. In addition, an isolated surface wave is found to exist with its propagation wave number in a ‘forbidden’ region of wave number space. The relevance of this wave to a transmission null in a phased array antenna is discussed."
"An expansion scheme, which converges rapidly, is developed for computing the backscattered cross section of electromagnetic waves from turbulent media. The scheme is based on the average rather than actual field with the use of the distorted-wave Born approximation, in which the signal is modified to include attenuation due to scattering along its path length. If the receiver beamwidth is wide enough and the scattering is very directional, no net attenuation occurs. Net loss occurs when the receiver aperture is small and the scattering is diffusive. First-order modified Born is derived in detail, and relations are evaluated. It has the potential for providing saturation in the backscattered power as the level in refractive-index fluctuation is increased. Higher-order corrections are then calculated. Second-order modified Born provides a contribution to the transverse cross-polarization that is consistent with a modified version of the result in work by R. S. Ruffine and D. A. deWolf. Both of these in turn are consistent, within the limits of directional scatter, with J. W. Strohbehn and S. F. Clifford's cross-polarization, which results from fluctuations in refractive index gradients. It is also shown that the longitudinal cross-polarized component is related to diffusion effects and angle-of-arrival deviations. However, in several experiments the postulated attenuation implicit in first-order modified Born was found to be compensated for by other effects, probably by higher-order terms."
"The extended WKB method is employed to obtain a solution of the differential equation governing the dependence of field strength on height. The excess permittivity is represented as an exponential function of height. The method yields asymptotic solutions which become less accurate as the frequency decreases. It is found that the first-order solution can be used down to 300 kHz. For lower frequencies, the more complicated second-order solution is necessary, which can then be used down to 10 kHz. The results are compared with those based on an airless earth and an equivalent earth of 4/3 times the true radius."
"Detailed diurnal variations of F2 layer ionization in true heights have been obtained over the Tamanrasset meridian (5° S to 30° N) for 20 almost consecutive days in June and July 1966. Our improved time and latitude resolution in charting the evolution of the maximum ionization parameters, ƒ0F2 and hmF2, through the entire intertropical range made it possible for us to follow the movements of the two areas of greatest density known as ionization ‘crests’ their diurnal displacement on either side of the magnetic equator was found to differ from theoretical simulations, even those which take neutral wind into account. The asymmetry of their pattern in latitude and local time varies from one day to another much more than expected. The ‘summer’ side northern crest changes most; the maximum latitude extension of this crest varies in a complex manner with ap magnetic activity indices. Fast evolution phases, during early crest formation, and the deviation of the ionization structure from its expected ‘arch’ magnetic symmetry suggest a new type of low-latitude transitory process."
"In recent years, measurements by rocket, balloon, and satellite of cosmic X rays have suggested the possibility of observing ionospheric effects from celestial X-ray sources such as Scorpius XR-1, using low and very low frequency radio transmissions. The behavior of the nighttime D region under ionization by the X-ray spectrum of the Scorpius source is estimated for several stellar zenith angles. Although Scorpius XR-1 is the strongest source in the southern hemisphere, the integrated flux of all the other X-ray sources is comparable to that of Scorpius XR-1 and appears to modify the effect of Scorpius XR-1 alone on VLF data recorded in the southern hemisphere. Observations of the VLF transmission NBA (18 kHz, Balboa, Panama) made at Tucuman, Argentina, during 1963–1964 show a sidereal time variation in the diurnal amplitude change that follows the variation in the per cent illumination of the propagation path by Scorpius XR-1 during the nighttime hours. Even though the diurnal amplitude change can be shown to have a sidereal time variation, the diurnal phase change at Tucuman, Argentina, does not vary much throughout the year and yet remains consistently lower than that observed over a path of the same length from NBA to Boulder, Colorado, in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, it is suggested that the integrated effect of all the X-ray sources illuminating the southern hemisphere is to enhance the ionization in the southern hemisphere nighttime D-region, thus, producing the smaller diurnal phase change observed at Tucuman compared with that observed on a Boulder recording of the NBA signal over a propagation path of the same length in the northern hemisphere."
"A laboratory model of a section of the earth-ionosphere has been designed and constructed to provide a means for systematically investigating the effect of ionospheric perturbations on long range VLF paths. This model provides a capability for the investigation of a wide variety of different disturbed ionospheric conditions. For any given configuration, all the pertinent parameters are clearly defined and repeatable. This is in contradistinction to naturally occurring events, for which many parameters that are important for a clear interpretation are either unknown or, at best, poorly known. The design rationale and the construction methods are presented in this paper with initial experimental data obtained from the model for uniform propagation paths. It is shown that these data are in good agreement with theoretical data obtained for the modeled conditions. Data are also presented for propagation paths through a nuclear type ionospheric perturbation. These data exhibit both amplitude loss and phase advance caused by the perturbation."
"The geometrical optics convergence coefficient has been determined up to now only when the transmitter and the receiver are both situated on the ground or when the transmitter is at the base of the ionosphere and the receiver is on the ground. This paper presents formulas for the convergence coefficient regardless of the positions of the transmitter and the receiver in the earth-ionosphere waveguide. There are four different possible paths of the ray. The convergence coefficients are calculated for each of them, and numerical results are given."
"The laterally inhomogeneous anisotropic ionosphere is represented by a changing ionospheric surface impedance. The fields across such discontinuities can be estimated by computing the propagation characteristics on the various segments as in a homogeneous environment and by applying the resulting propagation parameters to the appropriate segments of the path. For fields observed across a day-to-night boundary, the resulting error is of the order of one per cent. The effects of more localized ionospheric perturbations depend on their azimuthal and transverse extent. In the lower ELF range, areas with transverse dimensions of one to two thousand kilometers affect the propagation path across the perturbation to about the same extent as a propagation path tangential to the periphery of the perturbed region."
"The scattering of electromagnetic waves from a turbulent plasma has been examined experimentally at 31 GHz. The 31-GHz cross section data agree well with a scattering model proposed earlier and with 9.4-GHz data measured earlier. Measurements were made to determine the dependence of the cross section on bistatic angle and electron density. Comprehensive diagnostic measurements were made on the plasma so that the radar measurements could be compared to the scattering model. A synthetic-aperture, or coherent processing, experiment was also performed to relate the instantaneous scattered field in a small volume (specified by the resolution obtainable by coherent processing techniques) to the instantaneous distribution of electrons in the same volume. The measurements confirm the validity of first-order Born theory when applied to instantaneous rather than time-averaged quantities."
"A loss in monochromaticity, or equivalently coherence, occurs when a laser beam is propagated through the atmosphere. One factor causing the loss in coherence is the scattering from the randomly moving atmosphere molecules. In this short note, the effect on a communications system's performance of the loss of coherence arising from molecular scattering is studied. The results are given for the propagation, over a horizontal path of length L, of an ideal-monochromatic, collimated laser beam with a radius R with L » R and with the geometric optics condition (λ L)1/2 < R satisfied (where λ is the laser wavelength). For the examples studied, it is shown that molecular scattering gives rise to only an inconsequential background noise in the receiver for typical communication systems. In particular, for λ = 1 μm and R = 5 cm and 5 m, the background noise is 74 and 54 db down, respectively. It will be necessary, however, for the communications engineer (and the radar engineer as well) to examine his particular case to ensure that the effects of molecular scattering are negligible or, if they are not negligible, that they are accounted for."
"The theory for the drift of ions in the F region is briefly reviewed, and it is shown that, for the restricted case of no external electric fields or neutral air motion, the velocity of the ions along the magnetic field lines in the upper part of the F2 region can be derived from the continuity equation. Experimental results for the electron density, electron and ion temperatures, and 0+ vertical velocity obtained by the incoherent (Thomson) scatter technique at Millstone Hill are presented for two 24-hour periods taken a year apart in March 1969 and 1970. The largest vertical velocities encountered occur around sunrise and sunset and give rise to vertical fluxes of the order of 5 × 108 ions/cm2/sec through 600-km altitude. It is shown that these fluxes are a result primarily of the growth or decay of the layer, though in the case of sunset the thermal contraction resulting from the decrease in the electron temperature with time assists in establishing the observed fluxes. The vertical velocity observed near 300 km is compared with the expected ambipolar diffusion velocity that should result from the observed pressure gradients in the plasma and from acceleration due to gravity. The difference between the observed and computed velocities is attributed to thermospheric neutral winds which have diurnal behavior similar to those determined by Vasseur (1969α, b) from incoherent scatter observations in France."
"Differential Faraday rotation measurements of the 40- and 41-MHz beacons of satellite 1964–64A/BE-B were made at London, Ontario (43°N, 81°W) through the use of a continuous output polarimeter of the phase comparison type, and simultaneous differential absorption measurements were made by use of the ordinary and extraordinary mode amplitudes at 40 MHz. Sufficient measurement accuracy was obtained to employ the second-order expansion of the magnetoionic refractive and absorption index equations to extract total electron contents, the ratio of the density squared integral to the total electron content, a mean ionospheric electron collision frequency, and a parameter sensitive to the height of an electron density irregularity, from the data. Two passes, orbit 17239, March 17, 1968, and orbit 17280, March 20, 1968, were selected for analysis. Peak electron densities, mean plasma scale heights, and mean electron temperatures were computed from the reduced data by the assumption of an electron density height profile; they were found to correspond to within experimental error with comparable published measurements. During both passes examined, F region electron density profile broadenings were detected that were, for March 20, attributed to adiabatic expansions of the F region electron gas, which was driven by localized neutral gas motions, and for March 17 the broadenings were attributed to thermal expansions of the F region plasma. On both occasions, the fractional errors in the data were sufficiently small over some portions of the pass to permit a determination of the dominant ionospheric absorption mechanism."
"Low-frequency pulse transmissions are received over reciprocal paths after being reflected once from the ionospheric D region. The daytime reflection height is near 70 km and the nighttime height is near 90 km. Over an 1830-km path between Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Jupiter Inlet, Florida, with a midpoint at 34°15'N, 75°28'W geographic (or 45°40'N, 352°20Έ geomagnetic coordinates), rapid simultaneous phase and amplitude fluctuations are frequently observed at night. Statistically these events occur more frequently near the equinox (seasonally) and near dawn (diurnally). They seem to occur more frequently on the path indicated above than on higher latitude paths at quite different geomagnetic longitudes; the events have not appeared at all on paths at geomagnetic latitudes below 30°N. A possible explanation for the more frequent occurrence on the Nantucket-Jupiter path is the fact that the midpoint lies slightly west of the magnetic conjugate to the South Atlantic anomaly. Detailed correlation of both phase and amplitude at both ends of reciprocal propagation paths tends to rule out gradients, offpath reflections, or instrumentation as causes of these events. Investigations of several different propagation paths suggest that these effects may be quite localized but that paths with similar geomagnetic latitudes can be similarly affected even when they are separated by more than 100° in geomagnetic longitude. LF ionospheric propagation is very sensitive to relatively small changes in electron densities in the D region. The events described above become less pronounced as the path length increases; this pattern suggests that they are quite localized and that the integrating effect of longer paths tends to mask the effects. Particle fluxes capable of producing electrons in the 10- to 100-electron cm-8 sec-1 range near 80 km at night would be expected to produce variations such as those measured. These LF phase measurements over oblique paths may prove to be an excellent method for detecting leakage or dumping of charged particles from the radiation belts into the lower ionosphere."
"The approximate image theory for quasi-static fields in the presence of a conducting half space is treated in full generality by considering an arbitrary periodic source. The general theory is developed in terms of a magnetic Hertz vector aligned perpendicular to the plane surface of the conductor. It is shown that its solution above the conductor can be expressed as the combined Hertz potentials of the source and its image located at a certain complex depth, plus terms that become negligibly small for points somewhat farther than a skin depth from the ordinary mirror image of the source. Image approximations for the individual electric and magnetic field components are derived. The magnetic field is expressed entirely in terms of the magnetic field of the source and its complex image, but the electric field, unless it is everywhere parallel to the surface of the conductor, depends in addition on the mirror image of the source. The general theory is illustrated by its application to the particular examples of magnetic dipole and infinite line current sources."
"A formal solution to the problem of the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a wedge with given surface impedances, moving parallel or perpendicular to its bisection plane with constant velocity, has been obtained. Characteristics of the diffracted field are studied, and approximate expressions for the Doppler shifts of the excited surface-wave fields and the scattered field in the shadow region are evaluated for both relativistic and non-relativistic considerations. Plots of these results for a 60° wedge and a half plane are shown to illustrate their dependence on the surface impedance, the wedge angle, and the angle of incidence. Also, the variation of the amplitude of surface waves with respect to the velocity of the moving wedge is discussed."
"The current distribution on a grid type dipole antenna immersed in a warm isotropic plasma is formulated from two viewpoints. The first method is a direct source approach; it yields a new integral equation that is an extension of Hallen's equation. The second method is based on a boundary value analysis introduced by Einarsson. The equivalence between the two methods will be shown. A solution to the integral equation valid for thin antennas shows that the current is sinusoidal in form with a propagation constant Ke = (ω2 — ωp2)1/2/C. This result will be compared with the work of Monroe."
"The theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in a uniformly accelerated simple medium is generalized to cover the case of arbitrary initial wave direction. The wave splits into two natural modes relative to the plane of acceleration and the wave vector. The case of high frequency and weak acceleration is solved in detail; to observers at rest with respect to the medium, a drag effect due to apparent gravity is demonstrated, and to inertial observers a drag effect due to medium acceleration is demonstrated. A preferred asymptotic cone of propagation determined by (μ∊ — 1)1/2 is found in the accelerated frame. Various drag effects are physically interpreted."

"These criteria established minimum requirements for the safety-related functional performance and reliability of protection systems for stationary land-based nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. Fulfillment of these requirements does not necessarily fully establish the adequacy of protective system functional performance and reliability. On the other hand, omission of any of these requirements will, in most instances, be an indication of system inadequacy. For purposes of these criteria, the nuclear power generating station protection system encompasses all electric and mechanical devices and circuitry (from sensors to actuation device input terminals) involved in generating those signals associated with the protective function. These signals include those that actuate reactor trip and that, in the event of a serious reactor accident, actuate engineered safeguards such as containment isolation, core spray, safety injection, pressure reduction, and air cleaning."
