"The most important factors in promoting the advance of the engineering profession, and in disseminating and rendering available to the world the valuable experience and data accumulated by engineers, are the professional associations or national engineering societies. The importance of interchange of data, and results of observation and experience, was realized long before the practice of engineering had been exalted to the dignity of a profession."
"Although the building of interurban electric railways has been carried on very actively in the Central States during the last six years, a general survey of the situation shows that the territory served by such roads is rather limited, especially in states west of Indiana. The typical interurban electric railway of the Central States costs from $20 000 to $25 000 per mile of single track. The building of such roads has therefore been generally confined to such places as in the opinion of the builders have sufficient population and resources to yield an annual gross revenue which will leave from $1200 to $1500 per track mile to pay interest on the investment after paying operating expenses, maintenance, and depreciation. Without going into details, it can be said in a general way that a gross revenue of $3000 to $4000 per track mile per year must be earned at the start on a most economically constructed interurban road of the ordinary type, if it is to be a financial success."

"During the summer of 1904 a series of tests was carried on for an operating company for the purpose of determining the most satisfactory method of metering the power delivered to certain consumers whose demands ranged from 200 to 1000 kilowatts. The aim was to determine, as far as possible, the nature and probable extent of the errors that occur in the established available methods of polyphase metering, and to find which of these methods would be on the whole the best to use for the given work — regarding as best that system in which errors are not only least liable to occur, but also in which, if they do occur, their presence can be most quickly and readily detected."
"The object of this paper is to invite discussion on what seems to be the more important features of instrument engineering, and its value to the Institute should be found in the discussion rather than in the paper itself."
"The usefulness of a satisfactory method of observing or recording the wave forms of rapidly varying electric currents and pressures has been appreciated almost from the time that investigators and designers commenced working with electrical apparatus. The various methods which have been used for obtaining these records or indications have had, and are having, an important influence on the design of apparatus and a clearer understanding of the phenomena accompanying their use. It is the purpose of this paper to outline briefly the steps which have led up to the methods in use at the present time, and to describe more fully the devices which are now most employed and the uses to which they may be put."
"To the company supplying electric energy which is measured by meters and charged for accordingly, the maintenance of meter accuracy is of supreme importance. Losses in other apparatus become insignificant when compared with the loss of revenue from meters that are allowed to follow their natural tendency to run slow. For example, in a steam boiler a drop of 10% from normal efficiency would be detrimental to approximately the same percentage in the single item of the cost of coal, whereas in the metering system it would be 10% of the entire gross revenue to which the supplying company is legitimately entitled. Furthermore, if a metering system did actually deteriorate so as to record 10% less than the true energy, this loss would by no means remain constant; it would continue to increase."
"The Illinois Steel Company has just completed and placed in operation at its plant in South Chicago, a new power-house for the supply of power to its various mills at South Chicago, and at Buffington, 10 miles distant. This station contains, at the present time, two units, each consisting of a 2000-kw., 25-cycle, 2200-volt, three-phase generator, direct driven by a 24-in. by 60-in. by 48-in. horizontal-vertical, cross-compound engine. The addition of two more generating units, of a capacity of 4000 kw. each, is contemplated in the near future. This alternating-current station operates in conjunction with a direct-current station which has been in operation for some time. The two power-houses are connected by means of synchronous converters. Both stations take steam from blast-furnace boiler-houses, in which the fuel is excess blast-furnace gas. The supply of this excess gas is quite variable at times, and it is desirable under such conditions to be able to shift load from one station to the other, as desired. Such an arrangement gives the opportunity of utilizing completely all excess blast-furnace gas at either point. The principal points of interest with which we are concerned to-night, deal entirely with the use of cement in the building of this and other power-houses."
"N. McD. Crawford (by letter): I desire to explain more fully the term “A” in the efficiency formula given in my paper. The definition of the term, as given, may be misleading; its value is obtained by multiplying the average watt-hours per ton-mile by tons weight of car, and this result by the cost of power per watt-hour at the switchboard."
"C. W. Ricker: The cost of applying bonds, which I have given, may be criticized as unduly low; it is intentionally very close, but it is attainable with compressed or expanded terminal bonds. The use of reliable hydraulic compressors might reduce the figures a little, but the amount would not be great, as the copper must be compressed rather slowly and the hydraulic machines are heavy and difficult to handle, so that the net saving of labor cost would be probably small, though the quality of work might be improved by their use."

"It is manifestly impossible to consider judiciously the relative commercial efficiency of two-motor versus four-motor equipments, or to reach any absolute conclusion unless certain conditions under which the equipments are to be operated have first been determined. For the purpose of this paper a line was selected having light grades and reasonably small line losses, a line passing through the business center of a city and reaching the residential section, thus at all hours of the day calling for a fair average number of stops and therefore reasonably rapid acceleration, in order to make the time schedule."
"S. M. Kintner: The author has given us a paper that is exceedingly broad in its scope, so broad that few, if any, are in a position to check it. The author has probably got more good out of the paper than any one else, in the very thorough investigation that was necessary for its preparation. In saying this it is not intended to detract from its value, for it is the belief of the speaker that this paper will prove of great value to more of us when we learn more about the constants involved and when higher pressures and larger powers are used commercially. The author has committed himself to but few engineering points, but some of these involve quantities of such magnitude that one is astonished in considering them, yet that is no reason for condemning the paper."

"President Lieb: The papers presented this evening represent an interesting series relating to indicating and recording instruments. This is a subject in which we are interested, either as buyers or sellers of current, or engaged in making tests, or conducting investigations in which this class of apparatus is used."
"President Lieb: I know that if there is a spirit pervading the administration of the Institute — it has also pervaded previous administrations — it is the feeling that the Institute is not merely a body of electrical engineers living and working in New York, but that it is a national body, that it represents and has at heart the interests of electrical engineers all over the United States. I feel that the central organization is certainly alive to its obligations and to its duties to the local organizations, as representing a very much larger constituency than merely the local membership of New York. Perhaps this feeling of greater interest which the members removed from New York should have will be aroused when our engineering building shall have been completed."
"One would infer from Mr. Nies' paper that the polyphase meter is an inherently inaccurate instrument. A polyphase meter so constructed that there are no mutual electrical or magnetic influences between the two meter elements, should and does operate just as accurately as the single element of a single-phase meter. This independence of the two meter elements is made permissible by connecting them together mechanically instead of electrically and magnetically. A polyphase meter mechanically connected between the two elements (that is, with two complete meter elements respectively acting upon two discs fixed to the same shaft) is polyphase only in that it may be so connected with polyphase circuits as to measure accurately the power whether the circuits are balanced or unbalanced."
"The idea of frequently calibrating and adjusting instruments, particularly integrating wattmeters, and providing a means for readily inserting standardizing instruments is to be highly commended. The use of modern potential and current transformers greatly simplifies the operations of standardizing and adds to the safety of the installation. The cupped-diamond bearing is a recent innovation; its use is highly recommended by those who have tried them."
"To the south of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and occupying portions of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, lies the high plateau commonly known as the Southern Appalachians.

"Edward Hemphill Mullin, one of the managers of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and a member of the Committee on Finance, died suddenly at his home in Milburn, N. J., on January 25, 1905. Mr. Mullin was born at Castlederg, County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1859. His education was of the best, and he was graduated in 1881 with honors from Queen's College, Belfast. He subsequently studied medicine in London, and although his tastes were in the direction of literature, his conversation showed that his medical training was never wholly submerged. Upon his arrival in the United States he entered the newspaper field, where his ready pen and genial presence soon brought recognition upon the staff of the Sun. His ability won for him an appointment as editorial writer on the Evening Sun, and in this practical school, of the highest type of daily journalism, he soon made his mark as an efficient and scholarly exponent of the best type in a rather strenuous literary circle. His appreciation of engineering, however, led to his final separation from active and direct newspaper work, and in 1898 he made an engagement with the General Electric Company as head of the bureau of publicity, a position which he was well qualified to fill, and in which he proved his usefulness to the entire satisfaction of the management. His connection with these great interests, and his intimate relations with the leading spirits in the electrical industry, naturally led to an extensive acquaintance, so that when called as he was to important missions by reason of his zeal and activity, success usually followed his efforts."
"The single-phase high-pressure trolley has arrived and evidently has come to stay. The advantages gained by delivering energy directly to a car without the necessity of an investment in synchronous converters and heavy feeders has long been recognized. That it is entirely practicable to take current from a high-pressure conductor by means of a moving contact has been fully demonstrated. It has required some time to show that there is a field for a single-phase traction motor sufficiently promising to justify its commercial development, but a number of motors of this type are now upon the market and within the last few weeks have been put in actual every-day operation."
"The chief advantage to be derived from the direct application of the alternating current to railway service is in the use of high trolley-pressures. Having a successful alternating-current motor, the remaining problem of greatest importance is the method of supplying current to the car. The third rail, which is largely used in heavy railway work, is obviously unsuited for carrying 3000, 6000, or 10 000 volts on the score of insulation and of safety. Moreover, the third-rail construction, whatever be the pressure, is not suitable for terminal yards in which there are many tracks and in which derailments are not unusual. A smash-up would be almost certain to result in tying up the system."
"In the earliest days of electric-railway work with crude apparatus and light loads, track resistance was neglected. As the need became evident, auxiliary return wires were run and connected to the rails at frequent intervals, but of a size which now seems absurdly small. Joint bonds were first of small iron wire like railroad signal-system bonds, then pieces of copper wire with the ends riveted in holes in the rail-web, then pieces of trolley wire with channel-pins and so on, until specially-designed terminals were developed."
"F. B. Crocker: At the Philadelphia meeting of the Institute in May, 1894, the speaker read a paper entitled “Unipolar Dynamos for Electric Light and Power.” It received little encouragement then and there has been very little since that time. The present paper is therefore welcome, as it is the first ray of hope in 11 years for the successful development of a machine of this type. This paper gives evidence of real progress; the machine is not experimental — not a one-kilowatt machine generating one volt, but one that gives 300 kilowatts at 500 volts."
"President Lieb: The paper by Mr. Moultrop on “Modern Central Station Design,” brings us face to face with a problem which has been before us these 20 odd years. It will not be a loss of time to consider for a moment the progress which has taken place in central station development, and in order to place this before you the speaker will abstract some of the data and some of the conclusions drawn therefrom as they appear in the last United States census report."
"Wm. McClellan: The chief value of the author's paper is its exposition of the methods used. So far as results are concerned, there will be widely differing opinions. The speaker believes that the author has been very liberal except in what might be called the factor of safety. Apparently, three circuits have been provided, each with one-third load capacity. If one of these nine wires should fail only two-thirds of the rated load could be carried. We have, however, plenty of reserve in the converters, etc. In a line projected some time ago there was one extra wire provided for emergencies. The provision in this respect does not seem quite consistent. On the other hand, one must remember that these conductors are of solid copper, one inch and a half in diameter, and not likely to get in trouble except in the land of cyclones."

"The Twenty-second Annual Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was called to order at 9:45 a.m. by President Lieb."
"Jacob Chester Chamberlain was born in India, of American parentage, on July 3, 1860, being the son of Jacob Chamberlain, M.D., D.D. He died of bronchial pneumonia at New York, July 28, 1905, aged 45 years. In 1872 he was brought to this country to complete his education. He was graduated with honors at Rutgers College, New Brunswick, N. J., in 1882. In 1883 he took a post-graduate course in chemistry. Soon after this he entered Mr. Thomas A. Edison's laboratory, in Goerick Street, taking an active part in the pioneer electric lighting work of those days. He was engaged as an electrical engineer in the historic first Edison electric light station in Pearl street; while in this position he devised a number of improvements for locating grounds which at that time occurred frequently in the street feeders. In 1886 he was engaged as electrical engineer and superintendent of construction for the Sawyer-Mann Electric Company. He then became interested in traction, and in 1889 was engaged as electrical engineer of the Julien Traction Co., which was introducing storage-battery cars. While with that company he took out a large number of patents relating to the improvement and development of the storage-battery system for railway work; some of the patents relating to controllers were quite fundamental and were acquired by the General Electric Company. In connection with traction work he developed and patented some special gears and pinions to reduce the losses which occurred in transmitting power from the motor to the car axle. The motors at that period were comparatively high speed, so that double reduction was resorted to, involving rapid depreciation of the pinion. About this time he received the degree of Master of Science from Rutgers College."
"H. G. Stott: The ordinary overload relay as described in Mr. Chellis' paper is employed to do the opposite of what the telegraph relay does : that is to say, the telegraph relay is used to apply a strong current to operate the receiving apparatus, while the purpose of the overload relay is to apply a comparatively weak current to operate a switch apparatus, because the main current has reached such pressures and strengths that it has become exceedingly expensive if not impossible, to design relays to work on main-line current. Different requirements have called for the design of different types of relays. The principal types mentioned in the paper — the overload, the differential, and the reversed-current, all have an application which is very concisely described in the paper."
"Discussion on, “High Power Surges in Electric Distribution Systems of Great Magnitude”, and “An Experimental Study of the Rise of Potential on Commercial Transmission Lines, Due to Static Disturbances such as Switching, Grounding, Etc.”"
"Mr. Steinmetz has outlined not only the practical instrument and its results, but he has given also a theoretical investigation of the phenomena involved. This apparatus is one which is very important in its applications, as it will often even determine the selection of the type of distributing system. With the extended application of series alternating-current arcs, it has become, I think, more and more evident that they are not of equivalent value to direct-current arcs; the result is that in many cases a strong pressure is brought to bear for direct current for series arc lighting. This apparatus is efficient, small, and inexpensive, and I hope it will enable this question to be solved from our ordinary alternating current distributing systems."
"There are one or two questions I would like to ask, probably Mr. Fisher can answer them. At the top of page 694 it is stated:"
"I have been much interested in investigations of high potentials, and must confess I have always been prejudiced against electrostatic voltmeters, possibly because of some disastrous experiences with early forms of such voltmeters, that were liable to be 25 or 30 per cent. in error without giving indication thereof. Therefore I have always preferred the method of measurement by step-down transformer and the low potential voltmeter, or for very high voltages by ratio of transformation with step-up transformers, with a careful investigation of the high-potential circuit, to see whether there could be any deviation from the correct ratio by capacity effects and how much that might amount to."
"In the discussion which Mr. Howell refers to, and which took place in Section “E” of the International Electrical Congress, the question of the best form of distributing system to use hinged largely upon the question, whether the 220-volt lamp had arrived at a point where it was quite equal to the 110-volt lamp. Colonel R. E. Crompton and some of his confreres of the Institution of Electrical Engineers maintained very stoutly that this was the case in England, whereas general experience in the United States had been to the contrary, and therefore if their contention was right an explanation should be forthcoming why americans had not gone to the 220-volt × 2 system. If their contention could not be made good, evidently a part, at least, of the argument in support of their contention of the wisdom of changing to the higher voltage must needs fall. Hence the desirability of such information as Mr. Howell has laid before us. in his paper."
"The presentation of this paper was prompted by the development, in the course of an investigation, of certain facts which indicated that the disadvantages of the three-phase motor for traction purposes had been very largely exaggerated, and its advantages either underestimated or overlooked. To present, in concrete form, a few of the points raised, it seemed desirable to take a specific case, and therefore that was chosen which is already familiar to the Institute, through the medium of Mr. Berg's paper read some years ago."
"Before beginning this discussion I want to say one word about Mr. Waterman's comment. I did not think I was to be misunderstood in stating that the conditions of the Valtellina line favored the three-phase system. These conditions would possibly be considered very unfavorable in Europe, but in this country they would certainly be considered favorable, for the curves there are not nearly so severe and the grades are not nearly so numerous as here. This brings me naturally to Mr. de Muralt's paper, and I want to state that it must not be forgotten that in all discussions of the substitution of one motive power for another, it must be borne in mind that the existing service is not merely replaced by something that does as well, but by something that does much more than that. Who is there that is operating electric street cars by electricity that is satisfied, or would be satisfied, with the same service from electricity that he once got from horses? Nobody. The advent of electric traction, bringing new possibilities, also increased the demands of the public. It increased the requirements that were prescribed for the electrical engineer by the railway line owners and managers. The difficulty is that the street railway has progressed marvellously, and this has happened because facilities for its development were furnished by electric traction. The same condition prevails where electricity is substituted for steam on steam roads. The railroad president or manager is not satisfied with the substitution of electricity unless the trains are run faster and cheaper. One of the other reasons why I mentioned the Valtellina line as being a favorable case is that the runs are longer than would be the case in most suburban lines, and that the acceleration required is not so great. I need not dilate on that subject because if the length of the run is decreased and the acceleration increased the comparison becomes much less favorable."
"Those who have had to deal with such problems as are considered in Mr. Dodd's paper have surmised that there was a displacement of weight that altered the effective adhesion at some of the wheels. It was called to the attention of the Institute 2 years ago in Mr. Parkes' paper on braking, that such a displacement occurs, and causes the tilting of the trucks when the brakes are applied. There is also a displacement of similar character due to the acceleration of the car body itself, which causes a tendency to tilt the car body backward during acceleration, and to tilt it forward during retardation. Three phenomena are presented of which only two have heretofore been recognized. Mr. Dodd has formulated the forces involved, and indicated the manner in which these forces operate, and given an analytical statement of their action and reaction upon each other."
"Mr. McClellan has brought to our attention a factor in the working out of heavy traction problems. I think that the first thing the electrical engineers will have to do, or will have to try to get steam railroad people to permit them to do, is to fix upon a standard form of electric current and electric pressure for the service of heavy locomotives. If, for instance, it were decided to deliver power to large electric locomotives uniformly at 25 cycles and 6 000 volts, single phase, it would be then possible to design quite a variety of interchangeable electric locomotives for trunk line service. There are a number of locomotive systems that have been suggested which are equally adaptable to this work. If locomotives of these systems can be arranged to be interchanged between different railroad systems, as the traffic on eastern lines increases and the western lines become electrified, the old locomotives can be put in service in the west and the electrified roads will become more or less a single inclusive system. I personally feel that it is useless for us to hope that there will be any greater uniformity in the design of electric locomotives than there has been in steam locomotives."
"I am surprised that Mr. Thullen has attempted to treat such a subject in so short a paper, because when one sees the mass of detail entering into the improved signal system it seems almost hopeless to attempt to describe it. The amount of detail looks discouraging and the expression of a number of our engineers (excepting the signal engineers) before the system was started was “How will the trains be kept running; it is so easy to stop them and so hard to get them started again?” For instance, we start out with a transmission line, a 60-cycle transmission line to the different sub-stations, and that was to supply ultimately, after passing through transformers, about 550 volts, carried to a main busbar running the whole length of the system. In addition to that, there are still in each sub-station motor-generator sets consisting of a direct-current motor operated from the busbar, and that directly connected to a small 60-cycle generator, which is held as reserve so that in case of failure of the 60-cycle power from the main power-house it can be supplied immediately from the sub-station by putting in one of the small motor-generators in each sub-station and synchronizing them. These in turn feed into the 550-volt, single-phase, 60-cycle pair of wires running the entire length of the subway. They in turn feed transformers, and these transformers supply 14-volt busbars running the entire length of the system. In addition to that there is another line of storage-batteries for supplying the lights and they in turn are fed from the third rail at different points. In addition to that there is a main air-pipe line which of course is controlled by the electrically operated signal system between interlocking and overlapping sections. There is such a mass of complication and detail that it seems absolutely hopeless to attempt to make any description of it. The record of performance of the 60-cycle relays in the Manhattan Railway system has been remarkably good. I think the actual record is something like 300 000 successful performances to one failure, and it is improving all the time. That in itself was on an absolutely new system when installed in the New York subway. In the subway system one track rail is used for the return current, what might be termed the traction current, and the other rail is insulated and is used only for the signal service."
"Mr. Reid's paper gives us a theory to account for the phenomenon which I think is the best we have so far although to my mind it does not explain all of the facts that we observe. The theory that the blackening of the commutator bars is due to volatilization of the copper is confirmed by the following fact: when the sparking has not been too severe there is a very delicate layer of copper deposited on the under side of the brush which layer I have observed may be completely removed from one brush and deposited upon a brush of opopsite polarity if, for instance in the case of a generator, the polarity of the generator be reversed. The fact that this layer of copper changes its brush when the current changes its direction, implies that the action is electrolytic, and we know could be electrolytic only if the copper were volatilized. I cannot account for sufficient energy in the contact of the brush with the copper bar to produce this volatilization in the manner Mr. Reid points out. I have run a carbon brush at enormous densities on plain brass and copper rings and have not had such deposits. I think the deposit is the result of some change in the brush after the machine has started running. It is an old maxim with me that all new brushes are good brushes. Whenever new brushes are put upon machines and freshly sandpapered, they work well. Blackening of the commutator, which occurs after the machine has been running some time, I have always attributed to excessive action commencing at the edge of the brush and causing an eating back of its contact surface. The depth affected may be only 0.01 of an inch, but the eaten or burned area travels back under the brush until it gets one-eighth or one-quarter inch back and then the forces that cause it balance with other forces and it stops. Evidence of this is seen in many brushes which, taken out of the machine, show a perfectly polished surface at the entering edge and a rather, dull surface at the leaving edge, these two surfaces being sharply separated from each other by exactly straight lines parallel with the mica. These peculiar markings are also found on brushes, sometimes in several degrees. There will be a bright surface, then a dull surface, then a surface of different texture. I therefore think that these surfaces may indicate that the brush is not making such good contact at one place as at another place. I do not mean it is out of contact, but the pressure of contact may be very much lighter at some than at other areas. Such lighter contact might account for sufficient energy to volatilize the copper at that point. The reason why I think this is so is that experiments have recently been made with brushes of greatly increased contact resistance. A brush of this kind has been devised by Mr. F. W. Young, and when these brushes have been used on machines which previously performed as Mr. Reid has described, the phenomenon he observed either in the neutral or the reverse field these strike one as eminently the only factors of importance. On page 318 Mr. Reid also brings in the effect of the distorting and weakening of the reversal flux by the armature ampere turns. In this he appears to bring in a needless complication; in other words, sparking is the result of too high a voltage between two consecutive bars. This voltage can be caused by only one thing; that is, the coil cutting magnetic lines. These magnetic lines constitute the field. This field is a resultant of two fields, one due to the field winding, and the other to the armature winding. The sparking of the machine at any load may be considered in two parts. In the first place the sparking due to the external field which he has already taken into consideration under the title of the reversal electromotive force and in the second place the sparking due to the field set up by the armature. In other words, this latter is due to the voltage set up in the armature coil by the armature coil cutting the lines which have been set up by the current flowing through the armature coils. This, however, is what is meant by self-induction. That is, the quantities inserted in the fundamental equation, pages 299 and 319, are entirely sufficient. Stated differently, the stability factor or ratio between armature ampere turns and field turns for the air-gap is not a factor of first importance. What must be done in designing machines is either to keep down what is called the self-induction or reactive voltage, or to provide a reversing field sufficient to render it innocuous."
"The main point in Professor Adams' paper, that strikes the practical designer is that the calculations are made with such exactness. Practical design is at best only an approximation, as the quality of material and the actual dimensions obtained in the shop vary in different machines. An important example of this is the dimensions of the air-gap in an induction motor. With the small air-gaps required in such machines, a variation of 25% among a number of machines sent through the shop at the same time, is not by any means uncommon."
"Fourteen years ago or so, when all generators were small and about the time when Mr. Parshall was at work upon the 1 200 kw. machines for the World's Fair, he stated as a law what Mr. Senstius has just put in excellent form; namely, that the amperes per pole in a direct-current generator were a limited quantity. While I agree with the general method by which Mr. Senstius arrives at his limitations, I do not agree with the actual values of the limitations which he reaches. For instance, his value of 1 175 kw. for a 125-volt machine is too high; 1800 kw., for a 300-volt machine, seems about right, and 1 450 kw. for a 600-volt machine is altogether too low. I should like to ask Mr. Senstius, if he is free to speak upon the subject, how he harmonizes his limit of 1 800 kw. at 300 volts with the existence and good operation of a certain 3 500-kw., 325-volt direct-current generator in Cincinnati. It would seem that the conclusions which he reaches in his paper are not confirmed by that machine. The fact that there is a limiting size for direct-current machines, particularly in the lower voltages, ought to be better known than it is. Manufacturers are constantly receiving inquiries for generators of these lower voltages and several times larger than it is possible to construct."
"Before speaking directly on the subject of this paper, a few general remarks may not be out of place."
"I am very glad to see that motor-generators are beginning to get their due. When synchronous converters were first brought out their theoretical and apparent advantages were so great that too much attention was paid to them and it has taken us a long time to recognize the very great advantages that motor-generators possess. The relative costs that have been pointed out by Mr. Waters to-day, and which were also pointed out by Mr. Eglin in a paper before the St. Louis Congress, and by Mr. Stott and others, are having the effect of drawing more attention to the availability of motor-generators. As I look at the tables on page 769 and especially with reference to the 500-kw., 600-volts, 60-cycles comparison, I see the motor-generator, costing under those conditions only 5 per cent. more. I would like very much if Mr. Waters would define what he means by the word “cost” in this table. There are so many things that may be included or excluded that the simple word alone does not give any information. He speaks of the motor-generator costing 20 per cent. more than the synchronous converter. Does that include any regulating device for the synchronous converter, also does it apply to machines set up or simply f.o.b. at the station; also are both machines three-phase?"
"One of the chief considerations in the transmission of power is a market. There is plenty of power available at many points where there is no place to which it can be economically transmitted where there is a demand for it. This necessitates the development of industries to match the powers. Many railroads, especially through mountain districts, follow streams. In 1892, when I was at Denver, at which time we had not thought very much about operating-railroads by electricity, it appeared to me that there was power going to waste along the line of railway up the Clear Creek Canyon, that would operate the whole system. Coal was brought from Utah, possibly 500 miles."
"The machine by Mr. Stanley is of great interest, and remarkable by reason of its reactions, which permit, without change of excitation, an automatic compounding or over-compounding; is that, a rise of voltage with increase of load. Perhaps the internal reaction of the machine and its mode of operation may be made a little clearer by looking at it from another point of view; namely, as a frequency-converter. The machine is an induction machine containing primary windings connected with an impressed electromotive force, of low frequency in this instance, and secondary windings connected to an external circuit load, and movable relatively to the primary windings. Now, in the simplest form this can be shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1."
"On page 500 of Mr. Nunn's paper, he assumes from calculations of Lake Erie's level for nearly 50 years that the elevations of the intake have been so selected that at extreme low water and most adverse conditions a full supply of water should always be obtained. While he has been speaking, it has occurred to me to inquire what view the promoters and owners of this great development at Niagara Falls take of the possible withdrawal of the water at other places, such as the tapping of the great lakes at Chicago. The outlet of the great lakes, it is well known, used to be at Chicago, and the divide there is only 14 or 15 ft. high. Recently with the reversal of the flow of the Chicago River to give that city a deep-sea waterway and a pure water supply from the lake there has been taken out of the great lakes and consequently robbed from Niagara about 8 per cent. of the water that formerly went over the falls; and the Chicago people are talking of making still greater withdrawals of water from the lakes. There is a great inducement to do this, because in addition to other uses the water already taken is furnishing 40 000 h.p. The question is more than a State one, since it is outside of the territory of New York; it is an international one. I should like to know what view the engineers take of the possible diversion of this water which would make the levels much lower than would be necessary to run the plants."
"The object of this paper is to describe: 1. The necessity of standardizing enclosed fuses. 2. The work of standardizing such fuses. 3. The result of this work, which is contained in the specifications for National Electric Code standard enclosed fuse. 4. The tests of enclosed fuse designed to comply with the specifications."
"In determining the variation of the value of the flux in polyphase induction motors, and its progression around the air-gap, it is customary to assume that the current in each phase follows a sine law. In this way it has been shown that the flux rotates synchronously around the air-gap and that its magnitude varies between a maximum and a minimum; but it does not appear that the law of this variation in magnitude has been investigated. It is common practice in determining its mean value to consider the flux a maximum (in the case of three-phase motors) when the three currents are, respectively, I, − 1/2 I, − 1/2 I, where I is the maximum current per phase; and a minimum when the currents are √3/2 I, 0, and −√3/2 I; the mean of these two values being then considered as the average for the cycle.∗ This method is, of course, only approximate; but it will be shown in what follows that the actual average is not only greater than the value obtained as above, but it may even exceed the above assumed maximum."
