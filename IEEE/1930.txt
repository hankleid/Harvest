"By \"piezo-electric, coupler\" is understood a piezo-electric resonator provided with two pairs of electrodes, by which, in the neighborhood of a frequency of mechanical resonance, electric energy may be transferred from one circuit to another. As the voltage transformation ratio between primary and secondary voltages is especially important in practice, this transformation ratio is investigated somewhat fully, and some experimental results are described. It is noted that this ratio must have a negative real component in order that the coupler may act as a regenerative linking device between anode and grid circuits of a tube oscillator. In the study of the effects of a crystal resonator on an electric circuit in which it is placed, the application of its motional admittance circle diagram has many advantages. Some theoretical applications are, for example, made in the present paper in considering the characteristics of a piezo-electric oscillator and of a piezo-electric frequency stabilizer. Representing the crystal resonator, which is an electro-mechanical vibrator, by an electrical circuit, we can obtain the conditions for the building up of oscillations in a piezo-electric oscillator. Three types of oscillators are treated here. The effective frequency-stabilizing action of a tube oscillator by means of a crystal resonator is considered from the point of view of the so-called \"Zieherscheinung\" in the case of a tube oscillator containing coupled oscillation circuits."

"In this paper are discussed certain phases of short-wave telephony, primarily, though not entirely, from the point of view of the transmitter. The field strengths which the transmitting station must provide at the receiver are considered. Typical data are given showing results obtained in transmission from Deal, New Jersey, to England. This is followed by a discussion of requirements and limitations of the transmitting antenna. The gains which arrays may reasonably be expected to provide are considered. The phenomenon of non-synchronous fading at nearby points is examined as to its bearing on the dimensions and performance of directive arrays. Other directional properties of the transmitting medium are also considered. Attention is then directed to the transmitting equipment, particular attention being given to the high-power part of it. Requirements, rather than circuit details, are emphasized. These include stability of operation, flexibility, and freedom from amplitude distortion, and phase and frequency modulation. The results of tests in which some of these matters were considered quantitatively are given."
"This paper describes a directive radiobeacon (or radio range) of the visual indicating type, which has been developed by the Bureau of Standards to provide radio-marked courses at air terminals where more than four airways converge. The radio range is similar in design to the double-modulation type, with the addition of a third amplifier train and accompanying modulation frequency. It provides twelve equisignal zones which may be oriented within rather wide limits and made to coincide with the converging airways. In order to prevent coupling between amplifier branches special means are employed to supply them successively rather than simultaneously. These methods are described in detail. Three-phase radio-frequency supply is used to excite the amplifier trains, which is received from a single-phase oscillator of conventional type by means of a phase divider. This prevents possible trouble due to the employment of a three-phase oscillator with three tuned oscillating circuits. To transfer the energy to the antenna system a goniometer with three primary coils is employed. These are displaced 120 deg. from each other and coupled to the two crossed loop antennas through two secondary coils whose displacement is 90 dog. This permits the use of two antennas to establish a space pattern from three amplifier branches. Means for aligning this resultant space pattern with the airways are also discussed and several examples are given. Satisfactory tests have been made at distances of more than 100 miles."
"For the 12-course radio range system, in which three modulation frequencies are used, a type of reed indicator has been developed to indicate when the aircraft is on any one of the twelve courses, and if off, approximately how many degrees and whether to the right or left. In addition, it indicates to the pilot in case he becomes lost which is his nearest course, how to turn to get on it, and which way he is flying on it. This is accomplished by the use of three reeds in the visual indicator, each reed being tuned to one of the modulation frequencies sent out by the radio range, namely 65 cycles, 86.7 cycles, and 108.3 cycles. Unequal amplitudes of vibration of the reeds indicate the plane is off the course to the side of the reed having the greatest amplitude. A simple shutter with windows, in front of the vibrating reeds, exposes any two at a time. The correct two for a given course is determined by a color system which is exposed by the window to correspond to the color of the particular radio range route marked on the map. A second shutter and color system is provided so that the rule, \"longest reed indicates side off course,\" may be made to hold regardless of the course being flown or the direction of flight."
"This article discusses networks based upon singly-tuned circuits, and upon coupled circuits with primary and secondary both resonant to the same frequency. Transmission equations are developed and it is shown that for a desired possible transmission-curve shape, the sum of all decrement coefficients must be a certain amount, readily computable for coupled circuits as well as for single circuits. Coupled circuit transmission-curve shapes may be developed from single-circuit curves by a multiplication process as in staggered-cascade amplification, or by a vector difference process, employing two staggered single circuits with opposite couplings from a power source. A special case of the vector difference method is the coupled circuit itself, with primary current the vector sum and secondary current the vector difference of two single-circuit currents. This property permits a suitable coupled system to be used for radiating energy of two closely adjacent channels from a single antenna without cross reactions on the power sources. Complex networks are handled by transfer equations by which a branch consisting of a voltage source and resistor in series coupled to a network by a transformer device is replaced by an equivalent voltage and impedance within the network. Application is made to computation of interstage amplifying transformers, and of single-and two-circuit filters with resistance loading. A brief treatment is given of the impedance and power-factor loading of generator circuits which is of especial importance when tuned networks are output devices of power tubes operating at high plate efficiency."
"This paper describes the standard frequency equipment established at this laboratory. A valve-maintained tuning fork of Elinvar steel, made by H. W. Sullivan Co., Ltd., London, has been taken as the working standard. Some of the important characteristics of its frequency variation have been measured and adjustments have been made in order to minimize the variations which have been observed. The absolute value of its frequency has been measured through a long series of tests and the follwing value obtained as the mean frequency: 999.770 cycles per sec. at 36.0 deg. Cent. The precision of measurement is estimated as being well within one part in one million, but, because of the effect of atmospheric pressure, the constancy of maintenance is a few parts in one million. Two stages of multivibrators multiply the standard frequency by one thousand and the calibration can be made with an accuracy of one part in several hundred thousand. In order to determine the constancy of maintenance of the standard, a piezo-electric oscillator has been calibrated from time to time over a period of five months ond the results have been satisfactory."
"In this paper, experimental results and theoretical considerations are discussed which concern the amplification and detection of electric waves shorter than one meter in length, in a system wherein diodes and triodes are connected so as to produce oscillations of the Barkhausen and Kurz type. A simple theory of the electronic effect in the detector action is given. In some of the circuits use is made of a magnetic field applied in the direction of the axis of the electrodes within the tube."
"This paper presents the difficulties inherent in the development of a body of law for radio. It points out that that body of law must be based upon sound scientific principles as presented by radio engineers. The radio engineer as an expert witness may be able to avoid the difficulties encountered by experts of other classes and take advantage of important opportunities for the education of courts and commissions. As legislative advisers the members of the engineering profession have tasks of great responsibility. Radio engineers can bring about a healthy growth of law through cooperative efforts and group consciousness."
"It is pointed out that variations in the amplification factor of triodes are due to different portions of the tube having different values of μ. The resulting μ variations over the operating range of the tube characteristic are very considerable in commercial tubes, and give numerous undesirable operating features."
"Communication tests in radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony on half-meter waves are described. The first section of the paper is devoted to the description of a new type of receiver for 40-80-cm waves. Experimental results are given to show the action of this receiver. It is pointed out that a sort of regenerative amplifying accompanies the detection of such extremely short waves, and a brief explanation of this action is given. The next section of the paper contains the results of experiments on a half-meter transmitter, with special regard to the modulation system. In the latter portion of the paper, actual tests of communication to the distance from 10 to 30 km are described. The possible application of our wave collecting system to direction finding with such extremely short waves is pointed out."
"The purpose of this paper is to investigate theoretically the effect of rain, fog, or clouds on the propagation of short raidio waves. The theory of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium in which are suspended spherical particles of an arbitrary material is first reviewed. The available physical data on fog and rain is then referred to. The conclusion is arrived at that for waves greater than 5 cm in length, the effect of ordinary rain or fog on the absorption is negligible."
"(1) The received field intensity was less affected by the variations of the meteorological elements in the environs of transmitting stations than by those of the receiving station. (2) The field intensities for both daylight and night reception varied inversely with the changes of atmospheric temperature and absolute humidity on the receiving side. This was in agreement with the daylight results obtained by Austin and Minohara. (3) The intensity-pressure relation was not found to be so apparent as in the case of (2), though in the monthly average variations the field intensity seemed to have direct relation with atmospheric pressure in summer and inverse relation in winter. (4) The influence of weather on the field intensity was found to be still less clear than in the cases of the above-mentioned three meteorological elements."

"Experiments on short-distance communication using a wave-length of two meters together with details of equipment used are described. A range of over 12 miles was obtained with a super-regenerative receiver. The advantages of a limited-range short-wave system for certain maritime and other purposes are listed."
"A potentiometer has been developed for the measurement of the amplitude and phase of voltages at frequencies up to at least 106Cycles per sec. Two slide wires are used which carry currents whose phases are approximately in quadrature. A method of standardizing the instrument is described, that is, of determining the relative phase and ratio of amplitude of the currents carried by the two slide wires. Due principally to distributed inductance, the constants, especially the phase angles, of the best networks of resistances and capacities which may be built up are uncertain at 106cycles. The method of standardizing is to measure a suitable network and then rotate the phases of the currents in the potentiometer, or in the network, by about 90 deg., leaving their ratio and relative phases constant. The voltages of the network are again measured and a simple calculation gives the constants of the potentiometer and of the network. The ratio of the currents in the two slide wires or dials may be determined to within one per cent, and their phases to 1/2 deg."
"This paper is a comprehensive study of the practical considerations in the determination of the field strength laid down at any distance by a given radio station at any given location. All factors entering into such calculations are considered and practical means of their determination or estimation set forth. Methods are provided for the evaluation of field strength due to the space ray which should prove of value in further work on this subject. No attempt at extreme accuracy is made, the keynote of the paper being practicability."
"The differential equation of a frequency modulated transmitter is considered and the expression of the current as a function of time is derived. Frequency analysis of this function is made for two specific cases, (A) sinusoidal frequency modulation (telephony) and (B), right-angle frequency modulation (telegraphy with \"marking\" and \"spacing\" wave). The distribution and amplitudes of the frequencies present are seen to depend upon the value of an absolute parameter, the \"frequency modulation index,\" equal to the ratio of the maximum frequency deviation to the imposed modulating frequency. The overall width of the band occupied is found to be approximately double the highest of these two frequencies. In the case of high-speed frequency modulated telegraphy, however, side frequencies of noticeable amplitude may occur outside this band. Charts are included showing the derived frequency spectra."
"The effect of the cavity before the membrane in the usual condenser microphone is to cause an increase of pressure at the membrane over that which exists in the undisturbed (free) sound-field, particularly at high frequencies. An approximate theory of the effect is given and a specimen case is calculated. In this case the pressure ratio reaches a maximum of 2.5 at 3000 cycles. Experimental values obtained with the Rayleigh disk are compared with the computations and are in general agreement. A modified design for a condenser microphone without a diaphragm cavity, and adapted for spherical mounting, is described. The temperature coefficient of sensitivity due to the unequal thermal expansions of a duralumin membrane in a steel mounting was found to be 0.6 per cent per degree C. The importance of taking the cavity and reflection effects into consideration in the construction of curves showing the overall fidelity of broadcast transmitters is stressed on account of its intimate relation to the design of radio receivers for uniform frequency response."
"Certain kinds of radio interference travel many miles over wires and cause trouble in radio reception. Often this interference originates on one system which is coupled to another and, because of complaints, the interference investigation is started from a point near the second system. The usual methods of locating the trouble are not very effective in such cases. The oscillographic method analyzes the interference more exactly, giving its magnitude, frequency, and phase position. It is also shown that various types of interference give characteristic patterns on the oscillogram and a number of oscillograph records are included illustrating common disturbances found in radio reception. It is thus possible to point out when the interference at two widely separated points originates at a common source."
"A non-mathematical survey is given of the theory of the upper atmosphere and the behavior of wireless waves. The new physics of the atmosphere based on heating by the sun, cooling at night, winds, gaseous diffusion, etc., the observations of the heights reached by wireless waves, the skip distances, ranges, polarization, etc., led to the conclusion that the ionization in the upper atmosphere was caused by the ultra-violet light of the sun and that the electron density had a maximum value of about 3×l05at 190 km for summer noon. The calculated ionization agreed well with the wireless facts during the day but fell off too rapidly at night. Below the maximum the ionization was not known exactly. The diamagnetic theory of the diurnal variation in the earth's magnetism called for an ion density of about 5×109from about 150 to 190 km. The drift currents of the ions, due to the earth's gravitation and magnetism, causes the sunset longitude to be at a potential of about 2000 volts above that of the sunrise longitude. This voltage, combined with the earth's magnetic field, causes the ions and electrons to rise at night. They move up into regions of lower molecular density where their recombination is less. Their rate of loss at night is about right to agree with the wireless facts. It is pointed out that quantitative experiments with waves between 70 and 400 meters, of which there have been very few, might contribute valuable information about the ionization."
"This paper describes the essential details of a portable shielded temperature-controlled piezo oscillator constant in frequency to better than one part in 100,000. The quartz plate is mounted in a special plate holder so that the air-gap changes very little as the quartz plate shifts in the holder. The plate holder is mounted in a thermal-attenuating chamber consisting of a copper cylinder and layers of asbestos, contained in a wooden box. The copper cylinder is mounted on heavy bronze coil springs to absorb shocks. A sensitive mercury thermostat, placed in a slot in the side of the copper cylinder, controls the temperature. The heater operates on 110 volts direct current. The quartz plate is connected between the grid and the filament of the oscillator tube. An inductor, having a natural frequency slightly higher than that of the quartz plate, is used in the plate circuit of the tube. The load is kept constant by loosely coupling to the output through a screen-grid radio-frequency amplifier. Measurements on the piezo oscillator give the following results; temperature coefficient of 0.0025 per cent per degree centrigrade change in temperature of the quartz plate itself; 10 per cent variation of plate or filament voltages from operating point of the oscillator tube causes less than 1 part in 1,000,000 change: jarring has no measurable effect on the frequency."

"Attention is called to the principal difference between the present success of audible pictures and the failures which preceded it. The similarities and differences between broadcasting and audible pictures are pointed out. This includes a comparison of the installations, a comparison of the pickup and reproduction conditions, etc. Some of the advantages of disk recording are pointed out. Measurements of the acoustical characteristics of recording stages and theaters are given, as well as system frequency characteristics. The factors limiting the frequency range on disk recording are discussed. Some of the problems in sound editing are mentioned and the elements in greatest need of improvement are pointed out."
"This paper deals briefly with (1) the desirable characteristics of measuring equipment employed in making the usual tests of radio receiver performance and (2) a description of apparatus and technique used in carrying out several special tests. Measuring equipment and methods are discussed with reference to the elements of the receiver, after which are remarks on the usual tests of sensitivity, selectivity, and fidelity. Under special tests is a discussion of measurements on hum, tube and circuit noise, modulation distortion, intermodulation, audio harmonic analysis, and volume control. Some specimen curves showing results obtained on model receivers are presented."
"Operating characteristics of compact, dry, electrochemical, high-voltage filter condensers, comprising a dielectric plated sheet electrode contacting with a gummed spacer rolled with an untreated electrode sheet, show that such condensers are in all respects suitable for power-pack filter service and effect large reduction in costs. Commercial condensers of this type have working voltages up to 700 volts d-c. The leakage current, which determines the merit of an electrochemical condenser, is extremely small in the case of the gum condenser and affords a very long operating life. Gum condensers are operable in the extreme temperature range from -30 deg. F through +250 deg. F."
"This paper discusses fluctuation noise in radio receivers due to shot and thermal effects (Schottky) in the radio-frequency circuits. The r-f noise components beat with the carrier when a signal is being received and are transformed to audio components which are heard as a hissing noise. The mathematical theory for a receiver employing a square-law detector is given, and it is shown that the deflection of a meter measuring the average square of voltage or current due to the noise is proportional to the area under the curve representing the square of the over-all transmission against frequency. The overall transmission is somewhat analogous to the over-all fidelity of the receiver. This result is similar to the well-known laws for simple linear networks without frequency transformation. The method of calculating the noise due to the shot and thermal effects is discussed. Finally a convenient method of measuring the specific noise (noise per frequency interval) in a radio receiver is described, and results for several typical commercial receivers are given. The method consists in comparing the noise, as referred to the antenna circuit, with the amplitudes of the side bands, mE0, in a standard modulated signal."
"A screen-grid voltmeter of high sensitivity is described and compared with a triode voltmeter. At low frequencies, using either the 222 or the 224 tube, it effectively covers a range of from 0.1 to 10 volts, r.m.s. At frequencies of the order of 108cycles per sec., it serves as a supersensitive indicator for a Lecher wire system. For this purpose a tuned input is used."
"The reflection of an elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave from partially conducting and perfectly conducting surfaces is studied in detail. It is shown that in either case the interference of incident and reflected waves gives rise to a pseudo-stationary wave field above the surface of the reflector. This field is bodily propagated along the horizontal projection of the direction of the incoming wave with a velocity greater than that of light, i. e., c/sin α where α is the angle of incidence. The resultant field at any given point lies in a plane whose orientation varies with height. This fact is made the basis of experimental measurements. It is found that the 43-meter wave from WIZ, located at New Brunswick, N.J., holds its polarization and angle of incidence constant during morning hours at Ithaca, N.Y. The rapid fading that accompanies the signal is attributed to purely amplitude fluctuations. Observations on this station are analyzed, and it is shown on the basis of the above theory how it is possible to obtain the angle of incidence as well as complete information regarding the polarization of the incoming wave. Measurements on almost all other stations ranging from 25- to 50-meters wavelength show highly erratic conditions."
"The following is a communication to the meeting of the American Section, International Scientific Radio Union, Washington D.C., April 25, 1930, in which present daily schedules and future plans for the international ex-change of radio-cosmic information are outlined."
"A systematic scheme of classification of subjects in radio science and engineering is necessary in classifying references to current radio publications and also for classifying all sorts of other radio material, such as reports, reprints, drawings, books, apparatus, etc. In an effort to fill the need for a radio classification this extension of the Dewey decimal system was prepared. Since the publication of the first edition of this circular, in 1923, the subject classification it presents has been used extensively by many radio research workers and engineers as well as by the radio section of the Bureau of Standards. The present edition brings the classification up to date and makes a few changes which use has shown to be necessary."

"This paper gives monthly averages of daylight signal intensity at Washington for 1929, as received from a number of European and American low-frequency stations. Several of the stations formerly measured have ceased to transmit regularly at hours sutitable for all-daylight transmission paths and their measurement has therefore been discontinued. The annual average field intensities of the European stations have not shown much change since last year, but the atmospheric disturbances have increased."
"This paper presents the results of field intensity measurements on low-frequency transmission (17.8 kc) from the R.C.A. station WCI, located a, Tuckerton, N.J. The results of observations made at Newton Centre and at Medfordt Mass., are presented. Apparatus for alternating antenna observations with variously oriented loop observations is described and the results of such measurements are presented. The relation of the state of elliptical polarization of received signals to loop responses for various positions of the loop is investigated theoretically, and the results thus obtained are applied to an interpretation of the observations. The necessary approximations required to render this problem determinate are pointed out and their questionable validity emphasized. The mean of the received signal intensity in the absence of magnetic disturbances is lowest during the night, and strong sunrise and sunset peaks are found. An inversion of received signal intensity is noted during magnetic storm conditions. At such times the night field strength exceeds the day field."
"This paper analyzes the performance of antenna arrays as influenced by certain variables within the control of the designing engineer. It starts with an extremely simple analysis of the interfering effects produced by two sources of waves of the same amplitude. This is followed by a short discussion of a paper by Ronald Foster, which considers two antennas and also 16 antennas when arranged in linear array. Two antennas separated in space by ¼ wavelength and in phase by ¼ period give sensibly more radiation in one direction than in the opposite. This, for convenience, has been called a unidirectional couplet. A number of these couplets may be arranged in linear array, thereby giving an extremely useful directive system. Diagrams are shown for such arrays as affected by the number and spacings of the individual couplets. The gains from such arrays are calculated and data are given showing fair agreement between calculation and observation. Directional diagrams for arrays of coaxial antennas indicate that somewhat less gain may be expected from this form than when the elements are spaced laterally. Combinations of these two types of arrays give marked directional properties in both their horizontal and vertical planes of reference. This principle has been used rather generally in short-wave communication. This paper also discusses effects resulting from combining two or more arrays. In one case the space between two arrays tends to emphasize spurious lobes."
"This paper describes briefly a clock system which employs radio time signals from a government station to correct automatically an electric clock system. As interference is the usual limitation of a system of this sort, special emphasis has been placed upon the pulse amplifier, by means of which pulses of a periodic character are amplified with an extremely high selectivity against interference. The mathematical theory of this amplifier is developed in detail, and response curves for several stages are drawn."
"A new vacuum-tube self-oscillating system having extraordinary frequency stability is described which depends on the reëntrant circulation of oscillations through tuned filter or coupling units. The reëntrant circulation through the filter sections attenuates all but a single frequency in a manner analogous to the attenuation produced by a filter system having an infinite number of sections. The unattenuated component having a single frequency is amplified at each passage through the system and constitutes the single-frequency oscillation. The methods and necessary precautions for attaining frequency stability are given. Frequency shifts due to ordinary variations of plate potentials, filament current, or keying are found to be of the order of one thousandth of one per cent. The extreme flexibility of the circuits permit the construction of satisfactory radio transmitters operating from the lowest frequencies up to 20,000 kc without the use of frequency-doubling stages. The oscillator system has found wide application in commercial and naval aircraft radio communication problems."
"Interpolation methods for determining the value of an unknown frequency in terms of harmonic standard frequencies are discussed under the following classifications: I. Direct beating methods, wherein the beat between known and unknown frequencies is utilized directly to operate frequency indicators or measuring devices. II. Direct interpolation methods in which the fundamental frequency of an interpolation oscillator is adjusted to zero beat in turn with the unknown frequency and the adjacent known harmonic frequencies. The unknown frequency is then found from the oscillator dial readings. III. Harmonic interpolation methods which are an extension of the principles of (II) permitting an interpolation oscillator of limited fundamental frequency range to be employed in the measurement of frequencies lying both above and below this range. IV. The principles of (III) point to a means for covering a wide range of unknown frequencies through the use of a low-frequency narrow-range oscillator fitted with harmonic producing circuits. A greatly opened-out interpolation scale may be obtained. Some disadvantages and limitations of the various methods are considered, as well as some advantages."
"After a brief discussion of some of the common methods of measuring frequencies from 0 to 200 cycles, a method is described which offers important advantages, combining a high degree of accuracy with ease and rapidity of use. The method depends on the fact that if a condenser be discharged through a resistance f times per second (the condenser being charged to the same initial voltage each time), then the average voltage drop across the discharging resistance is directly proportional to f. The unknown frequency is made to control the number of times per second the condenser is discharged, and thus the voltage drop mentionted above is proportional to the unknown frequency. A circuit arrangement is described whereby this voltage drop is balanced, through a sensitive galvanometer and high resistance, against a known fraction of the total voltage drop along a slide-wire resistance shunted around a storage cell. By first calibrating the system with an alternating current of known frequency, it is possible to read unknown frequencies directly off the slide wire. A discussion of the sources of error, and experimental determinations of the error actually observed, lead to the conclusion that, in the range from 75 to 200 cycles per second, the accuracy is always better than one-tenth cycle."
"The expression for the a-c current (rather the change in current due to applied a-c voltages) in any electrode is expanded in an ascending power series in terms of all the applied a-c voltages. It is shown that the coefficients in these series must satisfy a number of systems of linear simultaneous equations (one system for each power and frequency of the terms), and that hence to obtain the coefficients in any particular case it is merely necessary to set up these equations and solve them. The solution of the equations of course increase in complexity as the number of electrodes increases. The development does not make any assumptions of approximations, although in the discussion only the terms of the first and second degree are considered. It is shown, however, that however slow be the convergency of the series, the coefficients must always satisfy similar sets of algebraic equations."

"This paper presents a discussion of the causes of radio interference from insulators on high-voltage equipment. The present methods of eliminating this kind of disturbance are explained, and the question of future design is discussed."
"To determine insulation for an outdoor 220-kv. station on the coast subject to ocean spray, an insulator test rack was installed at Redondo, California. Ten types of insulator, including widely different designs, were tested continuously for two years and a half at 150 kv. to ground. Comparative results were obtained by adding or subtracting units in suspension strings until an equality against arc-over was approximated. Ninety arc-overs occurred. The surface leakage resistance was found to be a fair index of the resistance to arc-over under salt spray conditions. The shape of the insulator made no difference as long as the total surface resistance of the string remained the same. The surface resistance is that calculated utpon the assumption of a uniform conducting coating upon all the exposed surface of the insulator and is the line integral of distance divided by circumference along the shortest surface pathfrom cap to pin. Accidental differences of conditions are such that one insulator string would not consistently arc-over in preference to another unless its surface resistance were less than 80 per cent of the other. Suspension strings having a total surface resistance of 11.0, using inch units, were found satisfactory for a steady 150 kv. to ground under the conditions at Redondo. A spray method of cleaning insulators while energized was devised."
"This is a study of the 60-cycle flashover of strings up to voltages of 1100 kv., undertaken at the Ryan High-Voltage Laboratory, Stanford University. Investigation was made of the variations in flashover voltage for similar horizontal and vertical strings, with and without shields and tower members. An attempt has been made to correlate these flashover voltages with the point-to-point and point-to-grounded-plane arc-over voltages established in 1928 at the Laboratory."
"This paper gives the results of a rather comprehensive series of tests on the impulse insulation characteristics of wood and on combinations of insulators and wood as used in wood pole transmission line construction; and suggested methods of protecting wood from damage due to lightning discharges: also a brief discussion on the application of the data."
"This paper explains the electrical conductivity of metals in light of recent discoveries regarding the behavior of electrons. It is claimed that these discoveries have made possible a satisfactory theory of conduction. The more important discovery is that of the wave nature of the electrons. The other new discovery is known as Pauli's ``exclusion principle'' which states that no two electrons in a wire can have exactly the same velocity and direction of motion. In working out the theory, the statistiral method of the Fermi distribution function is employed. The paper shows that the theory satisfactorily explains how there may be emissions of electrons from a hot wire in spite of the fact that very little energy is put into the electrons by raising the temperature; it explains relative resistances of metals and their alloys, the contact potential between metals, the thermoelectric effect, the Peltier effect, and the change in resistance due to a magnetic field."
"During the last 35 years or more the development of insulating oil for use in transformers, circuit breakers, etc., has paralleled the development of electrical apparatus. Various steps in the development of oils for this purpose are described in the paper. These include the discoveries from time to time of elements which have been responsible for difficulties which arose in the use of such oils. These include such items as the effect of moisture, the importance of flash and fire test values, the question of fluidity for better cooling, the development of oils with non-sludging characteristics, and a statement of the long series of tests and experiments necessary to eliminate these various difficulties. The importance of a universal oil for insulating purposes is stressed and some of the conflicting characteristics for different uses are described. Attention is called to the selection of the proper raw materials from which insulating oil is derived, together with the extreme care which has been found necessary in the handling of containers, in making shipments, and in applying oil to specific purposes. While much has been accomplished in the securing of satisfactory oil, it is intimated that research and development must be more or less continuous so long as the electrical art advances and oil is used for insulating purposes."
"The effect of color on the temperature of oil-immersed self-cooled transformers under service conditions has been a mooted question for a great many years. Based upon the relative absorption powers of the various colors often used in painting transformer tanks the lighter colors should give appreciably lower temperatures in hot climate sections. The results of three series of field tests conducted on actual transformers are given in the paper. The results, however, do not show the advantages for the light colors that would be expected, based solely upon the absorption powers of the colors. A method of calculation is used to check the test results, taking into consideration the various factors which apply to a transformer and do not apply to, say, a piece of metal painted and exposed to the sun's rays, such as the ratio of the area of the surface exposed to the sun to the total surface dissipating heat, the difference in thermal capacities, and the condition where in one case the test piece is dissipating heat, as well as receiving heat from the sun, whereas in the other case it only receives heat from the sun. It is shown that when all the factors are taken into consideration the calculated results check very closely the observations."
"The origin of flames from arcs is considered. Their low dielectric strength is attributed to ionization, and their rate of recovery of normal dielectric strength is computed. The large influence of temperature is brought out. Computations are given and experiments described which show how flames can be reduced by passing the arc gases through narrow channels."
"A study has been made of the reaction of transformer windings in grounded neutral systems when subjected to transient voltage surges such as exist on normally insulated lines. Measurements of the voltage distribution throughout the windings between various elements and to ground were effected by means of a cold cathode type cathode ray oscillograph and sphere spark-gaps. An estimate of the stresses occurring in transformers due to the voltages occurring on transmission systems is made, basing them on the most recent data obtainable. The data indicate that the worst stresses, both within the winding and to ground, are in the vicinity of the line coil."
"The object of this paper is to present a description of the Spokane, Washington, underground network system, and to describe briefly the operating experience and problems which have resulted from the installation of ring primary feeders and a four-wire, 120/208 volt secondary network supplying a universal service. Reasons for the choice of the system described are presented with particular reference made to the use of a fuse in the secondary circuits instead of the device commonly known as the ``Network Protector.'' The general design of the primary feeders, secondary network, pilot wire relays and fuse protection, and transformer vaults is discussed. Descriptions are given of all apparatus and equipment used. A report is included covering tests made on the system under fault conditions. The report shows that the tests which simula ed actual operating conditions indicate the system will operate as designed. The voltage regulation of the network having been recently investigated, gated, is covered in detail. The procedure in the change-over from d-c. to a-c. service is discussed and the problem of customer consideration analyzed. The paper is concluded with a statement that no difficulties have been encountered on the system and that its operation up to this time has been perfect."
"For interruption of small currents at relatively high voltages, fuses and air-break switches are most commonly employed. This paper treats of these devices which are suitable for such service as protection on the transmission lines supplying small blocks of power such as rural lines. The requirements for this service are outlined and a discussion is given of the ability of the devices to meet these requirements."
"A wind tunnel for testing model airplanes and their parts requires accurate control of the air velocity. This paper describes a tunnel having electric drive for producing the air movement and explains a system of control, which allows a wide range of speeds and holds the speed very constant at any set value. Either hand or automatic regulation may be employed. The hand control is used for fairly constant speed while the automatic control gives very close regulation."
"The paper describes the technique and apparatus of sound picture recording and reproduction, with emphasis on their electrical engineering aspects. The various steps in the processes of disk and film recording are outlined as they take place in the Western Electric systems. Microphone placements, sound insulation, monitoring and mixing, and the circuits for amplifying currents and distributing them to recording machines are discussed. This is followed by a description of the disk and film recording machines. The changes which have been required in theater equipment to provide for the reproduction and projection of sound in synchronism with motion pictures are outlined. Some of the laboratory developments and studies out of which recording and reprodutction methods have grown are given brief mention."
"This paper briefly reviews the history of the step-by-step dial telephone system in small communities of metropolitan areas and notes some of the reasons for its recent rapidly growing use in small towns and communities apart from metropolitan areas. The wider appreciation of improved service by the public in the last three years is noted and requirements of the service now being rendered are discussed. The equipment is described and the methods of operation and maintenance are given. The effect on outside plant, building design, and other related subjects are discussed as are also the results obtained in the use of this telephone system."
"An equation is developed for use in meeting emergency conditions which necessitate the paralleling of transformer banks whose impedances expressed in percentage form are not equal. This equation makes it possible to calculate what change should be made in the ratio of transformation of the bank with the lower percentage impedance in order to prevent its being overloaded when the total load approaches the combined capacity of the two banks. It is pointed out that such an expedient is a makeshift justifiable only when maintenance of service is the paramount consideration and efficiency is, for the time being, of secondary importance. When conditions arise which do justify such a temporary arrangements ment, the method developed in the present paper affords a simple, yet accurate, means of solving the problem."
"In the second part of this paper and in the appendices attention is given to simplified methods of treating the problem of system stability. Methods are recorded which have been found useful in making many system studies. These methods have had considerable verification by tests both on a model system and on large operating systems and have been simplified to such an extent that many operating companies are now finding it to their advantage to undertake the work of making careful studies of their own systems, just as they now make short circuit studies which formerly were thought too difficult and too highly theoretical. The first part of the paper gives some comments and conclusions of the authors and their colleagues as a result of many such system studies as well as studies involving more detailed methods, and also as the result of practical experience through contact with various operating companies. Some of these comments are based directly on an example which is given in detail in Appendix I."
"The factors determining the power-carrying capacity of a transmission system are briefly discussed in this paper. The principal effects obtained by the operation of synchronous condensers used to compensate for the system consumption of lagging reactive kv-a. are pointed out. This method of compensation is contrasted with the direct method of supplying the reactive kv-a. to the line in the manner in which it is consumed, i. e., by the series method. A plan for obtaining direct or series reactive kv-a. compensation by a method employing electric machinery is described. This includes a description of a method for producing the required voltage and inserting it into the system. Some of the characteristics of operation and advantages to be gained by the use of the described method are given."
"This paper deals principally with the physical and technical phases of the development in recent years of ``toll'' telephone service in this country, with particular emphasis on the longer haul or ``long distance'' traffic. The very rapid growth in toll telephone business has required a rapid extension of toll plant including outside plant, buildings, and switchboard and other equipment. The most striking developments in the outside plant are very great growth in toll cable networks and the rapid extension of the carrier telephone systems. The factors involved in the relative use of these various types of plant are discussed. An outline is given of the advance planning and study necessary to insure that these annual programs are properly engineered so that, as closely as possible, they will effectively anticipate future requirements and extensions in a most suitable and practicable manner. The more important limitations affecting the design of toll plant from the standpoints of the efficiency, quality, speed, and length of telephone transmission and the specific treatments of each are generally discussed in the paper. These include such matters as the use of loading coils, vacuum tube repeaters, equalizers for attenuation and phase distortion, and means for reducing the effects of echoes and time lag or delay in the circuits. Mention is also made of modifications of the open wire plant to effect material reductions in crosstalk and to thereby permit a substantial increase in the use of carrier telephone facilities."
"The long distance telephone office serves to provide a concentration point for intercity telephone communication from a group of local exchanges and its size will depend largely upon the number of stations served by the local offices. The Chicago Toll office, which serves 1,200,000 stations, has recently been largely replaced with new equipment. This equipment, together with correlated improvements in handling toll service at Chicago, is described in this paper. The work of the toll operator in handling toll calls with the new equipment is compared with the former method and it is this change in operating practise which constitutes a major improvement in long distance service. The paper also includes a description of the toll lines entering Chicago with their equipment arrangements including telephone repeaters and the power plants required to operate this equipment and that associated with the switchboards. The addendum describes the purpose of the auxiliary and special switchboards which are required only in large installations such as Chicago."
"The successful operation of an air transportation system depends in no small degree on the communication facilities at its command. Rapid and dependable communication between transport planes in flight and the ground is essential. Two-way radio telephony provides this necessary plane-to-ground contact. The design of a radio telephone system for this service requires quantitative knowledge of the transmission conditions encountered in plane-to-ground communication. An experimental investigation of these conditions over the available frequency range has been carried out and the results are described. A complete aircraft radio telephone system designed for the use of air transport lines and an airplane radio receiver designed for reception of government radio aids to air navigation are also described."
"Construction and operating experience has shown that a large part of the theoretically possible gains in efficiency due to higher steam pressures has been obtained in practise. What are the future possibilities of higher pressures? The biggest problem before station designers today is to reduce the cost of construction per unit of capacity. Some engineers have suggested that we should build cheaper and less economical stations. This is an unsatisfactory answer to the problem. The proper answer is to maintain the high standards of efficiency that have been established and reduce the cost of construction by intensive study and better design. Better engineering in the future is the answer to the problem. By the use of large turbine generator units and large steam generating units, the unit cost of construction can be reduced materially. The present practise of installing several boilers to serve one turbine generator increases the cost of construction. The use of large steam generating and turbine generator units will reduce the unit cost of high-pressure stations more than it will reduce the unit cost of normal pressure stations. If the steam generating units match the turbine generator units in capacity, we can design for unit construction. This unit construction will not only reduce the cost of construction but will also simplify operation."
"This paper describes the ground protection in the Brunot Island switch house of the Duquesne Light Company at Pittsburgh, Pa. This switch house constructed on the vertical isolated-phase plan, is divided structurally into several completely insulated sections. The well known fault ground bus system of protection is applied and made effective by the special features of construction not heretofore used. Details of building construction and of fault ground bus application are given. Arrangements for heating, ventilating, and lighting the buildings are such as not to interfere with phase isolation and insulation. Oil circuit breaker mechanisms are insulated where necessary to maintain the building subdivision into insulated sections. The fault ground bus location, connections, and special details of construction are outlined. Preliminary tests, relay settings, and operating results are given."
"The appreciable increase in the rating of generators, generating stations, and interconnected systems has resulted in large currents to be handled by generators, circuit breakers, reactors, cables, and station bus structures. This paper covers a discussion of the limitations on large generators and generating equipment by the present standard voltages of generation, the necessity for increasing the values of generated voltage, and the design, manufacturing, and operating problems involved in building high-voltage turbine generators."
"Large turbine alternators with two similar independent armature windings have recently been proposed, to permit the electrical segregation of bus sections in large stations without loss of synchronizing power. Several such generators have been installed, or are under construction, and it now seems that they will become of paramount importance in very large future stations. This paper explains the theory, and design limitations of these double winding generators, and describes their application in systems having different types of bus connections."
"Part I of this paper describes the installation of two 20,000-kw., adjustable load, variable-ratio, frequency converters interconnecting the 25-cycle and the 60-cycle systems of the Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company at Lockport Substation about twenty miles from Niagara Falls and Buffalo, N. Y. It also explains the function of the various machines, points out the more important features of the control, and relates a few interesting incidents in the past eighteen months of operation. Part II describes and explains the characteristics of such a converter and, more intimately, the operation and design of the component apparatus, using rather generally known and understood analogies, comparisons, and simple physical conceptions without any mathematical analyses or difficult theoretical treatment."
"Theory and experimental data are given on the properties of discharges confined to small holes, such as the pores of a naturally porous material. The characteristics of these discharges are such that they are well suited for utilization in a valve type lightning arrester."
"The low-tension a-c. network utilizing secondary network protectors has been adopted by five properties of the Standard Gas and Electric Company for service in areas of high-load density. The system has been applied to cities of the second class and smaller, although load density in certain cases is high. Each individual installation was made after a specific study of conditions involved. Underlying principles on which all of the designs are based are: (1) Primary supply at generator voltage (11 kv. or 13 kv.), (2) Omission of feeder regulators, (3) Simplified transformer vault design with barrier wall between primary and secondary equipment, (4) High-reactance transformers, usually inherent, (5) Use of secondary network protectors, (6) Three-phase four-wire secondaries, (7) Use of 250,000 cir. mil. secondary mains (or smaller) forming a solid grid without fuses. The operating experience of the installations made thus far has justified their application. The use of the system in other areas will be considered in future planning."
"This paper outlines some of the physical reasons and economic advantages influencing the establishment of Washington Park Distributing Station of the Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago. This station is located at the electrical center of the load which it supplies. It receives energy at 66 kv. from an outlying generating station, State Line Station. The voltage is reduced at the distributing station and fed to a number of substations at 12 kv. The past practise of this company has been to feed the substations at 12 kv. directly from generating stations. However, a study indicated several reasons for discarding the practise in this case. The main physical reasons were the congested condition in the underground cable system surrounding Calumet Generating Station and the distance from Calumet Station to its dependent substations. The economic advantages consisted primarily of the decrease in transmission line costs due to the location of the distributing station at the center of the zone load and the savings resulting from the use of 66-kv. instead of 12-kv. for the primary transmission system."
"The paper gives a historical outline of the development of carrier-current communication on power systems. It discusses the principles of the various systems of carrier current developed to date and outlines the fundamentals of a carrier communication system over a transmission network. A description of the installations on a 132-kv. network having an extent of 2500 linear miles is given and the general experience with carrier, which is the sole means of communication operated and provided by the power companies on that system, is outlined. A carrier-current communication system is analyzed into its component parts and the experience with these various parts given. Extensive experience with various forms of couplings, various forms and makes of coupling capacitors is described. Experience with the protective system, the lead-in system, and the tuning used in connection with the coupling is given in detail. Detailed experience is given with the transmitting system and the receiving system of various makes of carrier employed. An outline of the experience with the various makes of power supply is given. A discussion of the operation of carrier on a large system such as the one described and the necessity for zoning and interzoning is given and experience in establishing and maintaining these zones is outlined. Definite data are cited as to cost, maintenance, reliability, traffic, and safety. A description of various types of portable sets developed and their use is given."
"This paper describes extensive field tests made on the super-high-speed excitation equipment used with the 30,000-kv-a. synchronous condensers at the Plymouth Meeting Substation of the Philadelphia Electric Company. Oscillograms and calculated curves showing the performance of the synchronous condensers with this equipment are included, together with a discussion of the results obtained."
"This paper presents a method of calculating polyphase induction motor performance which eliminates a large amount of detail work without making use of approximations which sacrifice accuracy. In any rigorous system for calculating induction motor performance, the determination of the relation between input and current values makes the greater part of the work. By the procedure here presented, the relation of watts to amperes for all cases likely to be encountered in ordinary design work may be accurately calculated once for all and recorded in a set of curves. When making practical calculations tedious detail work may be eliminated by taking the necessary values from the curves, in much the same way that sines are taken from sine tables. The calculation begins with the torque, from which the corresponding secondary input is obtained by a simple formula. Then, by reference to the appropriate curves and a few simple slide rule operations, the primary and secondary currents are determined. With the secondary input and the current values known, the completion of the calculation requires nothing more than a few operations of simple arithmetic. The entire process for one load point may be completed in from five to seven minutes."
"The measurement of torque under unstable conditions of speed is usually extremely difficult and inaccurate when a dynamometer, prony brake, or similar torque measuring equipment is used. The device described in this paper was developed primarily to obtain torque measurements under unstable conditions as well as under stable conditions, and to obtain a permanent record of these measurements. It has been particularly successful in recording speed-torque curves of motors during acceleration and it can also be applied very effectively to other fields."
"The theory of synchronous machines as developed by Doherty and Nickle1 has been extended to include a determination of the effect of armature circuit resistance on damping torque. Equations are developed for the damping torque of synchronous machines in general, i.e., both the salient-pole and round rotor types. These equations assume an exciting winding in the direct axis and an amortisseur winding in the quadrature axis, and further assume that all damping is due to currents induced in these two windings. The effect of an amortisseur winding in the direct axis is not considered because its damping action at the low frequency of hunting is small compared to that of the exciting winding. It is shown that the damping torque of any synchronous machine can become negative, giving instability, if the armature resistance is increased beyond a critical limiting value. This fact has been known,2 but an actual determination of the value of the critical resistance in terms of constants of the machine has not, to the authors' knowledge, been available. This value, for a salient-pole generator with normal excitation and no amortisseur winding, is r = xq tan δ' where r is armature circuit resistance†, xq is quadrature synchronous reactance, and δ' is the steady-state displacement angle. If r is less than the critical limiting value, the damping torque is positive; if greater, negative. The damping of a generator increases in the positive direction with increase in load."
"Certain theories of the breakdown of gases are reviewed. Their limitations or correctness in the light of recent data on the breakdown of large gaps with surge voltages are considered. The work of various investigators on the time lag of breakdown also is discussed briefly. It is shown that comparisons are made difficult and that large discrepancies, particularly at the shorter time lags, may result from variations in the definitions of time lag and breakdown time. The existence of ionization or streamer currents of high magnitude previous to the final breakdown is established and a number of volt-time and ampere-time oscillograms of flashovers on various types of insulation is shown and discussed. The effect of these streamer currents in attenuating a traveling chopped wave is shown."
"Heat dissipation is an ever-present factor affecting the design and operation of many kinds of electrical equipment. Usually, the problem is to get rid of heat due to losses. Sometimes the problem is how to conserve heat. Radiation, or convection, or conduction, or combinations of these, enter into all cases. Engineering literature as a rule presents conduction and convection in sound terms, but in many cases, the treatment of radiation is unsound, misleading, and sometimes in error. This paper is presented with the hope of putting heat radiation in engineering applications on a sounder basis. The usual laws given to cover total heat radiation are stated and discussed, and their limitations brought out. Net heat loss by radiation interchange for the cases of parallel and concentric surfaces are reviewed and stated. The problem of total radiation from a rectangular slot is attacked, the method of solution is indicated by example and discussion, and the results given."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the application of the watt-oscillograph to the study of the performance of rotating a-c. machinery under transient conditions. Some typical transient cases are presented with a view to illustrating the possibilities of such an application. The analysis of a film taken with the watt-oscillograph yields not only power, but also current and power factor. It is thus possible, for the case of sinusoidal voltages and currents, to determine the locus of the current vector as it changes from one position to another. The paper also describes the watt elements of the oscillograph developed for this study, with data as to the degree of accuracy that may be expected from them. An outline of the method of analyzing an oscillogram so as to obtain the performance curves and the current locus is also given."
"The well known circle diagram of a transmission network is applied to electrical machinery, giving circle diagrams of alternators, synchronous motors, synchronous condensers, and transformers. These diagrams give a graphical representation of the machine performance under all possible conditions. Such quantities as power loss, power input, power output, field current, etc., for any operating condition can be obtained by inspection. These diagrams have the same field of usefulness as the circle diagram of the induction motor. The transmission network circle diagram can be applied to the induction motor, yielding in the approximate representation the Heyland diagram, which is merely a special case of the more general diagram. The transmission network method of attack gives a straight-forward solution of many induction motor problems that would otherwise be difficult to handle, such as a motor equipped with a phase advancer. Methods of obtaining network constants by measurements rather than computations are described."
"This paper describes an investigation of the effects of electric shock on the central nervous system. A total of 286 rats was employed in the investigation. These were shocked at 110, 220, 500, and 1000 volts on both alternating and continuous current circuits for varying lengths of time. In each series the duration of the shock was increased until it was found impossible to resuscitate the rats. When possible the rats were resuscitated by means of artificial respiration, and kept alive for about a week. Then they were killed by an overdose of ether and an autopsy was immediately made. The rats reacted in entirely different manner on the two types of circuit. At the lower voltages the alternating current was deadlier than the continuous, but at the high voltage the opposite was found to be the case. In many instances the rats were paralyzed by the application of the current and in the majority of these animals gross hemorrhages were found in the spinal cord at autopsy. All of the deaths that occurred as a result of the shock were caused by respiratory failure, which could usually be traced to an injury of the central nervous system. In some cases the electric current produced peculiar effects upon the rats."

"This paper describes a 22-kv. metal-clad outdoor type of switchgear. The design is a new departure from customary engineering practise in that all live parts are immersed in oil and enclosed in metal housings with each phase in its own independent compartment. The switchgear insures maximum safety to the operating and maintenance personnel and reduces construction costs for power station switching. The design is well adapted to mass production which should lead toward standardization resulting in a material savings in cost of manufacturing."
"This paper describes the development of a new auto-valve lightning arrester operating on the principle of discharge in restricted passages. A brief résumé is given of the improvements in performance and size desired in lightning arresters. Reference is made to laboratory tests on insulation protected with arresters to determine the limits of discharge voltage required for good local protection. Oscillograms show that the new autovalve arresters meet these requirements. Successful operating experience with these arresters is stated to give final verification of the results obtained in the laboratory investigations. The steps in the development of materials are described and the materials finally chosen and the design of arresters are considered. The performance is discussed and illustrated by oscillograms covering a wide range of currents, both with and without power voltage applied. The size of the new arresters is about one-half that of the present commercial autovalve arresters. One of the probable benefits resulting from this reduction in size is the possibility of making practicable the protection of high-voltage lines against lightning flashover."
"A new material has been developed which is peculiarly adapted for use in lightning arresters. It is physically similar to dry process porcelain and it can be made in any shape that can be successfully moulded. The manufacturing processes have been perfected so that the electrical and mechanical characteristics can be duplicated or varied as desired within practical limits. This material, which is called thyrite, does not follow Ohm's law, for each time the voltage is doubled the current increases 12.6 times. The ratio of change of current to change in voltage is constant over ranges of current of 10,000,000 to one. This means the resistance decreases as the current and voltage increase. The resistance at any particular value of voltage or current is fixed by the physical dimensions of the piece. It is slightly lowered at high temperatures but returns to normal when cooled. The resistance does not depend upon the rapidity of current or voltage change and it is unaffected by long service. Because of these definite characteristics of thyrite the action of lightning arresters can be accurately calculated for the first time. Thyrite is now being used experimentally in three types of lightning arresters. The station type is made in 11.5-kv. sections, each one containing its own gap unit so that no series arrester gap is required. These gap units have the desirable property of sparking over at practically the same voltage irrespective of wave front. The 11.5-kv."
"The extinction of an a-c. arc is analyzed as depending on two factors, the rate of recovery of dielectric strength of the arc space after current zero, and the rate at which voltage tending to reignite the arc is applied by the external circuit. In the short arc, most of the recovered dielectric strength resides in a deionized layer next to the cathode but in the long arc the rest of the arc space contributes largely to the dielectric strength. The breakdown gradient of the still ionized arc space is defined, and using a thermal ionization theory, a formula for growth of breakdown gradient is derived. The extinction of long a-c. arcs in the open is greatly influenced by the sectional area which the arc stream has at current zero. By confining arcs to slots and holes, the rate of deionization at current zero is greatly increased, and so large voltages per cm. of arc can be interrupted. A gas blast passing turbulently through an arc stream greatly accelerates deionization at current zero and so is effective in increasing the capacity of the a-c. arc to interrupt high-voltage circuits. The expulsion fuse is an example of a gas blast circuit interrupter, the gas blast resulting from the decomposition of the fiber fuse case. The oil circuit breaker is also a gas blast circuit interrupter, the blast arising from the gases produced by the decomposition of the oil."
"The relationship of the rupturing ability of oil circuit breakers to system stability problems is discussed, and conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness with which the oil must be used in arc rupture if the requirements of stability are to be met. Past attempts to improve the rupturing performance of oil circuit breakers are reviewed and the results of an investigation of the processes of a-c. arc extinction in oil are discussed, from which conclusions are drawn as to the degree of efficiency with which oil has been used in conventional oil circuit breakers. A description is given of a new device, known as the deion-grid, developed to permit the application of scientific principles to arc extinction in oil, and its theory of operation is discussed together with the results of interrupting tests in both the laboratory and field. Conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness of this device in improving the rupturing performance of oil breakers and its suitability for use where questions of system stability are involved."
"A review is given of the rules and procedure used in electrical engineering for the calculation of induced voltages in metallic conductors, not including radiation effects. For the e. m. f. in a closed circuit e = -d ϕ/dt, the restriction is stated that the circuit is a closed loop of infinitesimal cross section and without parallel branches. More complicated circuits are to be calculated by replacing them by a number of elementary circuits. Where there are moving contacts and conductors of finite cross section, the rule e = B l v should be used. A discussion is given of calculations by considering magnetic fields to have velocities and the restriction is stated that, in general, the resultant magnetic field should not be used with the B l v rule, when it is made up of component fields having velocities which differ in magnitude or direction."
"The object of this paper is to describe and discuss a general equation for the induced voltage of electrical machines having parallel coil sides, and which includes as special cases single and polyphase induction motors, synchronous generators, d-c. generators, synchronous converters, and static transformers. The application of the general equation to most of these cases is illustrated, and a number of interesting problems which may be solved by means of it is pointed out. A characteristic of this equation is that no restrictions are placed on the velocity of the moving conductors, or on the rates of pulsation and rotation of the flux; but these may vary in any arbitrary manner which can be given a suitable analytic expression. The several methods for the reduction of harmonic voltages are classified and their limitations discussed in such a way as to leave in mind a vivid picture of the process. Tables and curves have been prepared for comparing the effects of the skew, pitch, distribution, and phase connection harmonic reduction factors. A new method for summing the finite series of the distribution summations is given in Appendix II."
"The paper describes the Norinder cathode ray oscillograph as used in lightning investigations on transmission lines in 1928. It then describes a new model of a cathode ray oscillograph developed for the expansion of field and laboratory tests in 1929. One of the novel features of this modified instrument is the steel housing. A circuit is shown for obtaining a unidirectional time axis on the oscillograms, in which the timing movement is started by an impulse from the surge to be measured. In the appendix a simple and concise formula for the sensitivity of a cathode ray oscillograph is developed. This has been derived by Mr. Lewis R. Smith and takes into account the change of the mass of the electron at speeds approaching that of light. At the frequently used cathode voltage of 60 kv., this phenomenon already causes a deviation of 5 per cent from the value which would be expected otherwise."
"The post-war decade, which has given to the technique of the submarine telegraph both the regenerative repeater and the inductively loaded cable, deserves to be chronicled as one of the most significant periods in the history of the cable art. These two major developments and some important corollary inventions and applications are discussed in this paper. Reference is made to articles previously published describing recent developments at length. In addition the paper contains descriptions of: A two-element cable recorder code adapted to land-line transmission. A three-element Wheatstone code adapted to cable transmission. A cable printer system using a two-element code of practically the same time length as three-element recorder code. A typical installation of Pernot superimposed cable carrier apparatus. A brief account of the steps which have been taken to balance an inductively loaded duplex cable. An appendix to the paper comprises a discussion of certain variables which affect the traffic capacity of cables."
"A proposition to introduce a change in the units of the magnetic circuit was made at the meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (I. E. C.) in Bellagio, September 1927. The proposition was referred to an international subcommittee for consideration and report, by the Advisory I. E. C. Committee on Nomenclature. The subcommittee has recently reported, recommending that the matter be placed on the agenda of the next I. E. C. meeting, and that in the meanwhile, the subject should be discussed in all the national committees, more especially in the various electrical engineering societies, so as to pave the way for well considered international action. This paper has been prepared in the hope of presenting the questions definitely, with a view to eliciting discussion and opinions that may be helpful from the international point of view. As an aid to the formulation of views on the subject among those who may not have given special attention to the-historical development of the magnetic-circuit units, a short outline of their history is here submitted."
"The beginning of a new era of artificial lighting in which health is to be considered as well as vision is proclaimed in this paper. Facts regarding the health-giving properties of ultra violet radiation from the sun are outlined and the production of similar radiation by artificial means is discussed. Various methods of obtaining the desired rays are mentioned and considerable information is given on a new tungsten filament mercury vapor lamp which has been developed to provide this radiation conveniently and safely."
"The present paper describes an attempt to determine the distribution of energy in the electric arc by the calorimetric method. The total energy input to the arc was measured by a specially calibrated watthour meter. The energy dissipated at the anode and at the cathode was estimated by the temperature rise of the electrodes, which was measured by mercury thermometers. In experiments with the iron, copper, and carbon arcs, the anode and cathode were of the same weight and shape and were provided with an identical heat insulation. Since the ratio between the energies dissipated at the anode and at the cathode was made independent of the losses by radiation and the absolute values of energies involved, its determination was made with sufficient accuracy. In the case of iron or copper arcs in air this ratio was found to be practically unity. The presence of different fluxes alters the distribution of energy between the anode and cathode. In the case of an arc maintained between graphite electrodes, the energy at the anode was much higher than that at the cathode."
"This paper is directed to engineers interested in the application of resistance welding to the industries. The discussion foreshadows some of the latest tendencies of development. It deals with some fundamentals of design though it is not written as a complete treatise on the subject, nor especially for those engaged in the designing of resistance welding machinery. Differentiation is made between the older form of resistance butt welding and the later method of flash butt welding. The probable action taking place in the flashing zone is discussed, along with the effect that increased potential across the weld has on this action. The main object in flash butt welder designing should be to combine the maximum degree of acceleration of the metals into the flashing zone with the proper and necessary e. m. f. A study of the power division of a typical butt welder shows that the efficiency may be as low as 7 per cent or lower, but that nevertheless it competes with other methods of welding when applied to problems of mass production. The effect of external resistance in a flash butt welding machine is to offset variations in die contact and variations in stock resistance, thus stabilizing the flow of current in the flashing zone. The power factor of welding machines is not regarded by the designers as a major element, since the time of application of the current is at most but a few seconds."
"This paper presents an analysis of the sub-synchro-nous speed phenomena of a salient pole synchronous motor in which formulas and equivalent circuits are developed, making it possible to calculate the torque and current for a broad range of Conditions. Equations in terms of the impedances of the direct and quadrature axes are first derived from the revolving field point of view. The equivalent circuits for the two axes are then set up and expressions for the separate impedances of the circuit elements established. Adequate means of taking into account the combined effects of salient poles, incomplete amortisseur windings, and open or closed field windings are presented. The results obtained are illustrated by a comparison of the predicted performance and test data for a large 60-pole motor. The calculated distribution of current between the amortisseur bars of the same motor is shown by curves. Other curves show the calculated performance of the motor with and without continuous end rings between the poles and with the field winding open and closed. A final example shows the theoretical effects of changing the positions of the bars in the poles of a large waterwheel generator."
"The studies were made experimentally and analytically. In the experimental study, a model of hard wood was used, with a multiple of vent ducts of normal width of ⅜ in. each in the stator, the slots and teeth being of approximately average width. A four-pole rotor is distinct from one of a large number of poles; consequently two rotors were built, one of four poles and one of twelve poles, the latter being considered as representative of the greater number. The end bells and the imitations of the end windings were different for the two numbers of poles. In the test results given, data for only standard fiber wedges are included, but other forms were investigated. The vent fingers extended the full depth of the core, thereby enabling measurement to be made of the volume of air per vent per tooth, a rotating vane anemometer with a suitable funnel attachment being employed. The end bells were solid, simulating standard construction and the entrances to the two bells were joined to a common duct, in series with which was a thermal volume meter and an external blower, the speed of which could readily be adjusted. (See Fig. 6.) Pressures were measured in the inner and in the outer end bells. The rotor of the model was driven by a d-c. motor, the power input to which was measured. By this means windage damta wwere obtained, and many of those results are included among other data on the curve sheets."
"An instrument for measuring ultra violet radiation is described in this paper. The general plan of the meter is explained and a description of a small portable instrument is given. By means of proper choice of cells, as described in the paper, radiations of different desired frequencies may be measured."
"This paper outlines the characteristics of the Chicago territory and the power system which has been planned to supply this region. The extent and nature of the territory, the loads, and the service standards are outlined. There follow descriptions of the 25-cycle and 60-cycle systems, including voltages up to 132 kv. Protective and control features are discussed, as well as operating procedure. Information is given on the service record and on developments being planned for the future."
"Experience indicates that if electric light and power systems are to expand indefinitely without enormous obsolescence charges a carefully coordinated engineering plan must be adopted and, as far as practicable, system extensions fitted to it. This paper sets forth the principles involved and the plan adopted by the Detroit Edison Company. The description of the area served and the classification of customers indicates that the system is essentially of the metropolitan substation type supplemented by a 120-kv. transmission system. The importance of selecting proper circuit voltages and arrangements and their bearing on service reliability, system simplicity, and cost is discussed. The underlying principles and the ``Loose Linked'' Power Area Plan adopted to accomplish those principles is set forth. This is supplemented by the plan for short circuit and stability control and the resultant classification of substations, power sources, and protection schemes. Those characteristics of major electrical equipment affected by the plan are outlined. Operating procedure and results are given."
"This paper describes the service requirements for the various kinds of load demands in the Philadelphia area. The territory served and the distribution of load in it are also given. The fundamental plan of the system of the Philadelphia Electric. Company is outlined, including information on the location and capacity of the principal stations and elements of the transmission system. The various reasons and conditions which have led to the development of the system are explained. The major equipment, such as generators, transformers, synchronous condensers, etc., are described, with particular reference to the adaptability of their characteristics to the conditions to be met. Interconnections with other electric utilities are briefly outlined. The operating procedure, relating particularly to allocation of load to the various generating stations, reserve capacity, and frequency control, is discussed. Operating experience, including information regarding unstable operation at times of line faults, is presented. There are also presented, in conclusion, the more important basic principles which are followed, as far as practicable, in the development of the Philadelphia system."
"The extent of transatlantic telephone service and its growth since its inception in 1927 are outlined in this paper. It is pointed out that at the present time 85 per cent of the world's telephones are included in the area served and about 50 calls are made per business day. Analysis is given of the calls with respect to distribution by countries, by time of day, and by kind of message. The volume of calls, the rates, and a general indication of the quality of transmission are given. Plans for future extensions of the service are outlined."
"The application of short-wave radio transmission to transoceanic telephone circuits is developing apparatus and stations designed specifically to meet the needs of these services. This paper describes from the radio point of view the important technical features and developments incorporated in the new transmitting and receiving stations of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company located respectively at Lawrenceville and Netcong, New Jersey, and it outlines some of the radio problems encountered in the station design."
"The paper describes experiments on the charging current and other associated phenomena in high grade transformer oil. The charging currents remaining after the elimination of the initial transient were studied to within a few hundredths second of application of continuous voltage. Two samples of the same oil obtained at different times differed radically. In one case the charging current fell off from the start, while in the other it remained constant for an appreciable time or even temporarily increased. On reversal of polarity after a long charge the initial current with both specimens was the same as before reversal, but with one a large momentary increase occurred a few seconds later. Evidence is given on the time of recovery of the initial condition. The existence of space charges in the charged oil is shown, and the time of formation of these charges together with the resulting non-uniform distribution of voltage is measured. The importance of the charging current in its early stages is emphasized, since it is the initial conductivity which determines the a-c. loss. In an appendix a theoretical discussion is given on the influence of the space charges. It is shown that at least qualitatively these account for the observed phenomena."
"In the last few years contributions to corona literature by Holm, Ryan, Willis, and others have shown that the space charge liberated by alternating corona reacts on the corona to a high degree in determining its characteristics. This investigation studies the nature of these effects as influenced by variation in the limits of travel of the space charge. The three properties of corona readily lending themselves to experimental observation, the wave form and the value of the corona current, and the corona loss, have been observed when high alternating voltages are applied to a small smooth cylindrical conductor placed successively along the axes of four sizes of metal cylinders. In addition four frequencies of the alternating voltages were used. All the work has been done under atmospheric conditions. The theory of the influence of space charge as developed by Holm has been tested by experiment and a marked discrepancy is indicated. Values of power loss due to corona, as measured, differ appreciably from those predicted by Holm, but in general follow the quadratic relation suggested by Peek. Unusually large and clear oscillograms afford much interesting qualitative information as to the influence of space charge travel on corona."
"In the following pages electrical machinery is analyzed from a new point of view. Analytical quantities like magnetizing current, armature reaction, leakage flux, transient reactance are not introduced; only such quantities are used as actually exist in the machine at one particular load. Thereby the theory of electrical machinery is expressed in terms of the minimum possible number of quantities. No hypothetical currents or fluxes are used and no actual physical quantity is left out. The concept of ``free energy,'' used in thermo dynamics, is introduced and generalized. The criterion of good design of all electrical machines is expressed by a constant, the ``thermodynamic efficiency'' which gives a measure of the effective utilization of iron and space for the transformation of energy. This constant plays a most fundamental role in the steady and transient behavior of the machine. A method is given by which the direction of flow of energy between different parts of any complicated machine can be easily read off the diagrams. The theory of constant-potential and constant-current electromagnets is used as a stepping stone to show that the theory of the polyphase alternator is identical with the theory of the constant-potential polyphase transformer if flux linkages and magnetomotive forces are interchanged. The circle diagrams of the transformer and the alternator are developed as well as the elliptical locus diagram of the alternator with salient poles. Problems in the sudden short circuit and the sudden load variation of the polyphase alternator are also solved."
"Mechanical oscillations of synchronous motors following the application of abrupt shaft loads have not been hereto-fore easily calculated for cases of large angular swings, taking into account the damping currents in the rotor, except by tedious point-by-point methods. The chief difficulty has been due to the form of the basic differential equation upon which the solution of hunting problems depends. Within the lastfew years Dr. V. Bush and others at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have devised the integraph which is capable of solving the equations of the synchronous motor. Into the integraph are put curves representing the non-linear differential equations and the boundary conditions. The desired results come from the integraph as curves. In this paper the problem of sudden load on the non-salient pole alternator is solved by the integraph for enough different conditions so that the performance of practically any machine of this type may be easily predicted from the compiled results. Knowing the moments of inertia of the machine and its load, the characteristics of the machine running as a synchronous motor and as an induction motor, the maximum amount of sudden load for which the machine will remain in synchronism may be determined for different values of initial load. Other curves give the maximum angle of the first swing of the rotor and the time interval for the rotor to change from its initial position to this maximum angle. The simplest type of equation representing an ideal synchronous machine is solved in this paper."
"This paper is the fifth of a series which the authors have presented on the subject of synchronous machines. Part I was an extension of the fundamental theory; Part II, a treatment of torque-angle characteristics under steady-state conditions; Part III, a study of torque-angle characteristics under transient conditions; and Part IV, an analysis of single-phase short circuits. In the present paper, equations for the currents in the armature phases and field under three-phase short circuit are developed. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first covers the case of short circuit at no-load when the resistance is negligible in determining the magnitude of the current although it must naturally be considered in finding the decrement factors; the second considers the same case where the resistance does affect the magnitude of the current; the third covers the case of short circuit under load when resistance is negligible as in the first case. The effect of the nature of the load, i. e., whether the power factor is lagging or leading, is studied and some interesting results are brought out. It is shown that short circuits under load may give less current than at no-load, and it is further developed that under certain practical operating conditions it is even possible to obtain sub-stantially no fundamental current. The paper is illustrated with comparisons of calculated curves and oscillograms showing the actual currents obtained in test."
"Surging has occurred on power systems whose transmission distance is small and load density high. The Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has experienced these surges. This paper outlines tests conducted to determine the influence the steam turbine governors have in starting or sustaining a surge condition. The conclusions assumed are: 1. The governor system installed at Colfax Power Station will not start system surging. 2. The governor system will not sustain load oscillations."
"The available energy at the cathode of the iron arc for welding in air, and the disbursement of this available energy to the cathode processes, are set up in balance-sheet form for purposes of study. Since many of the constants involved are not accurately known the results obtained are approximate only and indicate the probable order of magnitude of the quantities involved rather than the exact quantities themselves. The paper thus represents a preliminary survey. The energy as heat at the cathode includes that from: (1) Ionic bombardment, (2) Ohmic resistance of cathode tip, (3) Radiation from the anode, (4) Combustion. The sum of the first three items should approximate one-half of the total energy input to the arc, (since the division of total arc energy between anode and cathode is nearly an equal one). Item (1) is by far the largest heat source. But using values of f = 0.625 (fraction of current at cathode which is carried by electrons) as determined by Compton and by Günther-Schulze, and taking the cathode voltage drop Vc = 9.0 volts which is higher than V1 the ionizing potential, (= 7.83 volts, Mohler) this quantity, together with the smaller items (2), (3), and (4), is still too small to account for the observed rate of melting of the cathode. Possibly ø+, the heat of condensation of incoming ions, is not zero for this arc as Compton has shown for the tungsten arc."
"This paper discusses the butt welding of steel sheets by the carbon arc process. It explains first that autogenous welding is divided into two main classes, viz., gas and electric; that electric arc welding is divided into two classes, viz., metallic and carbon arc. Gas and metallic arc welding in general require beveling of plates for butt welds while carbon arc welding does not. The controlling variables in carbon arc welding are (1) amperes in the arc, (2) voltage across the arc, (3) magnetic field about the arc, (4) atmosphere about the arc, (5) speed of feed, and (6) filling-in material. Discussion is given of the effect of each of these variables of the resulting weld with special reference to the action of a magnetic field parallel to the direction of the arc upon the current in the arc and the effect of the atmosphere about the arc on the ductility of the resulting weld."
"The paper describes a research undertaken with the object of throwing light on the relations between the electrical properties of dielectrics or insulating materials, especially on the relation between the ``anomalous charging current'' under a direct voltage test and the dielectric energy loss for an impressed alternating voltage. After a review of the theory of this relationship, the methods developed in this study for observing the anomalous charging current in condensers in the time range from 0.0007 to 0.100 seconds after impressing a steady potential are described. The methods used in observing the ``normal leakage current'' and the alternating energy loss and capacitance in the frequency range from 200 to 4000 cycles per second are also described. The results of measurements by these methods on mica, glass, varnished cloth, and paraffin paper condensers are given. These measurements include a series giving the effect of varying temperatures on the properties of the glass and varnished cloth condensers. Finally, the comparisons between the dielectric energy loss and capacitance variation with frequency predicted on the basis of the d-c. anomalous charging current tests and the variations which were actually observed are given. These comparisons show that a fair agreement exists between the predicted and observed curves."
"In a previous paper, the writers published results on the dielectric strength of various glasses and concluded that for ordinary thicknesses there were three distinct types of breakdown. The present paper emphasizes the fact that this is true not only for glass but also for fused quartz and for celluloid. By the elimination of edge-effect the following breakdown gradients were obtained: For celluloid, 2,500,000 volts/cm.; for glass, 3,100,000 to 5,000,000 volts/cm.; and for mica, 10,600,000 volts/cm. The various methods of eliminating edge-effect are discussed and compared and an attempt is made to correlate the electrical properties of the glasses with their chemical composition."
"This is the third report to be presented before the Institute of the research investigation of ionization phenomena in paper-insulated, high-voltage cables, which is being conducted at the Harvard Engineering School under the auspices of the Impregnated Paper-Insulated Cable Research Committee. This paper is a report of progress and will be followed by further reports as the work continues. The total power dissipated in impregnated-paper insulation may he separated by the graphical method into the component dissipated in the solid dielectric and that dissipated in the ionized gas films, and also may be separated analytically into these two components by selecting three suitable points on the power curve. This separation gives the three characteristic cable constants. When the power curve of a cable is analyzed into its two components, the ionization-power curve itself should be a straight line. Frequently, however, the ionization-power curve is concaved upwards. This is probably due to the non-linear characteristic of power loss caused by longitudinal and tangential stresses. Hence, it may be assumed when the ionization-power curve is concaved upwards, that longitudinal and tangential stresses exist within the cable. This theory is substantiated by investigations with cable models. The value of the maximum power factor and of the voltage at which it occurs are shown to be very simple functions of the three characteristic cable constants. With a considerable number of cables, the calculated and the experimental values of these quantities are in close agreement."
"It is pointed out that safe loading of transformers by temperature requires not only an accurate knowledge of the thermal laws but also a knowledge of what is a safe temperature limit to be maintained continuously which condition seldom, if ever, happens with the present method of limiting the load to nameplate rating. In view of our present knowledge and experience the author questions the advisability of loading transformers continuously up to the present A. I. E. E. limit of 105 deg. cent. hot spot and argues for the establishment of a differential of 10 deg. cent. between the limit to be maintained continuously by means of overloads and the limit to be reached occasionally with rated load. In other words, for continuously maintained maximum temperatures the hot spot should not exceed 95 deg. cent. It is shown by the use of the thermal laws that without increasing the maximum or hot spot temperature, transformers can be overloaded 1 per cent for each degree centigrade by which the ambient is below 30 deg. cent. (air) for self-cooled transformers, 25 deg. (water) for water-cooled transformers. The results of laboratory aging tests conducted on class A insulations in air and in oil are given. These tests show that the rate of aging is roughly double for each 8 deg. cent. increase in temperature."
"This paper discusses a proposal, sponsored by the Transformer Subcommittee of the Committee on Electrical Machinery, which is intended to serve as a guide in operating transformers by temperature rather than in accordance with their nameplate ratings. There is a real difference between ``rating standards'' and ``recommendations for operation;'' one simply specifies the measure of a machine under a definite set of conditions and the other constitutes a guide for loading under the varying conditions of actual service. With this difference in mind, a departure from the practise of the Institute up to this time is suggested; namely, that these operating recommendations be placed in an appendix of the Standards and considered not as rating standards but purely as a guide in loading transformers which have been designed to meet the Standards of Rating. One of the first things that had to be done in framing these recommendations was to settle the maximum safe limiting temperature of the windings for operation in actual service. The aim in making this selection was to provide for reasonable deterioration of the insulation and therefore a reasonably long life for the transformer. For reasons disclosed in this paper, a limiting temperature of 95 deg. cent. was adopted. This limit is 10 deg. below that used in the Standards for Rating. These are the high points of the proposal."
"The problem of telephone interference from a-c. generators feeding directly on the line with neutral grounded is discussed. It is shown that the triple and non-triple harmonics in the voltage wave shape cause currents which flow in different paths on the power system. As a result of this, the induction on paralleling telephone lines per ampere of triple harmonic is greater than the induction per ampere for a non-triple harmonic on a balanced power system. A method of measurement which would allow a rough comparison of the effects to be expected from both types of harmonics is suggested. This is based upon using the apparatus already available and setting up special connections for test. Data are given showing the results of such measurements made in the factory on a number of machines while they were being tested. Analyses are given of the wave shape of machines which gave rise to cases of interference. References are given to some of the data already published on methods which have been applied to relieve such situations."
"Line grounds on the secondary of an auto-transformer, fed from a grounded system, tend to invert the neutral of the auto-transformer. If the auto-transformer is isolated, this may lead to larger voltages, and if grounded, to larger currents than what would ordinarily be expected. The analysis of an important installation (75,000-kv-a., three-phase units at Detroit) is given below, for various possible connections and conditions of operation. Features of the analysis are: (A) A novel theory and method of auto-transformer circuit representation was developed to handle some aspects of this problem that otherwise appeared elusive. The method is applicable to all networks involving auto-transformers. (B) The rather startling fact is brought out and explained that fault currents to ground on the secondary lines of an auto-transformer may be larger when stepping-up than when stepping-down. The prediction has been verified by test."

"In the operation of an electric power distributing system involving various kinds of networks, a fundamental necessity is that each transforming and transmitting unit carry a reasonable share of the total load. In the case of a single system that has been developed in a coordinated manner the problem of load division has not in general been troublesome and has been solved by judicious selection of parallel circuits, use of reactors, proper system set-up, etc. The advent of inter-company connections has brought together systems of varying characteristics, changed the relation between the basic elements involved, and in some cases has made difficult the control of power flow over tie lines small in comparison to the systems which they unite. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the case of load control where closed rings or parallel path circuits are involved. After briefly reviewing the principles of voltage phase angle and power flow, a description is given of some actual tests performed on a very large interconnected system with a 250-mi. transmission loop, involving five power companies and a total generator capacity well over 1,000,000 kw. The results of these measurements are analyzed for the purpose of checking theoretical against actual values and forming a basis for the solution of problems of a similar nature."
"In the general application of welding to various types of constructions, those structures carrying variable stress have been least adapted to fabricated construction. In the present paper it is shown that by properly considering such factors as maximum working stress, residual welding stresses, and stress concentration, it is indeed possible to weld any type of structure without fear of trouble. Many various cases of such structures are described as to their method of fabrication and success of operation."
"One of the most important, and sometimes most involved, problems brought about by the many interconnections of electrical systems, is a means of accurate and flexible regulation of power flow. The adjustment of voltage and the control of wattless current by means of tap-changing-under-load equipment has become quite extensive. The regulation of power flow by means of phase-angle control has been put into practise on a limited scale. One means of accomplishing this, which has been used in a few cases and which is being considered on a larger scale, is the adaptation of tap-changing-under-load equipment with properly connected static transformers. The purpose of this paper is to discuss briefly the connections employed and the equipment used in connection with static transformers for the purpose of voltage and phase-angle control."
"Magnetic noise in induction motors is caused by the vibration of magnetic parts produced by the varying forces associated with the changing flux density in the adjacent air parts of the magnetic circuit. Torsional vibration of the motor is caused by unbalanced windings or applied voltages. Vibration of the rotor simulating a mechanically unbalanced rotor is caused by two fields differing by two poles and not of the same frequency or direction of rotation. Vibration of the stator by distortion from a circular shape results from the presence of other simple combinations of fields. Teeth tend to vibrate axially at double applied frequency. The magnetic noise produced by a motor can be predicted from a qualitative analysis of the air-gap field supplemented by an approximate quantitative analysis and consideration of the stiffness of the parts."
"This paper is a review of the work done and results obtained in Norindertype cathode ray oscillograph studies of lightning on transmission lines during 1929. The various installations and methods of test are described. The wave shapes recorded are illustrated and their meaning discussed. The paper also contains a preliminary description of an artificial lightning investigation, using a portable 1,000,000-volt surge generator and a portable cathode ray oscillograph. The methods used and some of the preliminary results are discussed."
"This paper presents the surge characteristic, in the form of time lag curves, of transmission line and substation insulation. The forms of insulation discussed are: I. Line insulation: suspension type with and without arcing rings, pin type, and wood alone and in combination with porcelain. II. Post type insulators with and without arcing rings. III. Safety gaps with either needle or spherical electrodes. IV. Oil gaps."
"This paper outlines the purpose of the cooperative installation of a lightning laboratory, the organization employed, and the various tests which have been made during the summer of 1929. In general, the paper presents the preliminary analysis of some of the most outstanding of a rather long series of tests and forms the background for a more complete paper giving a more detailed analysis which will be presented in the near future."
"During the summer of 1929 studies were made to determine the characteristics of voltage transients set up on transmission lines by lightning. A cathode ray oscillograph and a number of surge voltage recorders were connected to a 140-kv. transmission line in such a manner that lightning disturbances were recorded by the instruments. This paper describes the equipment used, and presents the results obtained from the season's investigations."
"The paper describes tests on a transmission line of the Consumers Power Company using a portable million-volt impulse generator. Data were secured on attenuation with one, two, and three conductors in parallel, with and without ground wires. A study was made of the influence of ground wires in reducing voltages induced by overhead discharging clouds and also the effect on surges of entering or leaving a section of line having ground wires. A brief study was made comparing steel and copper for ground wires. The effect of ground resistance in tower footings was considered and a method given for measuring surge impedance of transmission lines."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of a lightning investigation conducted during 1928 and 1929 on 114 circuit miles of a 220-kv. system located in a territory where severe lightning storms are frequent. During the 1929 investigation, which was a continuation and expansion of previous years' work, a number of devices was successfully used, such as surge voltage recorders, cathode ray oscillographs, electric field intensity recorders, and lightning stroke recorders. Some of these devices are new. Many valuable data on magnitude and wave shape of actual lightning surges were obtained, proof of the existence of both single- and multiple-phase faults due to lightning; some data on the shielding effect of overhead ground wires and qualitative data on the nature and time of discharge of lightning strokes, together with the atmospheric gradients resulting therefrom, were also obtained."
"Description is given of the Lightning Field Investigation on the 132-kv, Philo-Canton, 73-mile, two-circuit line made during 1929 with surge recorders, cathode ray oscillograph, lightning stroke recorders, and a lightning generator. Data are presented on the magnitude of lightning voltage surges, the attenuation of these surges as they travel along the line, and the difference in attenuation between positive and negative lightning surges. The preponderance of positive lightning surges is indicated; but the fewer negative surges produce the highest voltage on the line. The lightning stroke recorders gave data on the polarity of the direct strokes, and the magnitude of the current in the lightning stroke. Lightning arrester performance on lightning and switching surges is analyzed, and typical surges obtained by the cathode ray oscillograph are given for both cases. The magnitude and shape of lightning waves occurring on the line are shown and these waves analyzed as to duration of front, tail, and total length. These data are discussed as they relate to the proximity and rate of discharge of clouds producing lightning surges. General conclusions are drawn based on the data obtained in the investigation."
"The surge voltage investigations for 1926 and 1927 are briefly reviewed, and data given for 1928 and 1929. The cathode ray oscillograph has played a prominent part in the last two years work, and about 115 oscillograms have been obtained. New instruments were introduced in 1929 as follows: Lightning stroke recorders, field intensity recorder, and rate of change of field intensity recorder. A vast amount of progress has been made in the solution of the lightning problem. Personnel, equipment, and technique are available for the complete solution of the problem, by means of field and laboratory studies carried on simultaneously and supplementing each other."
"The following paper describes a unique adaptation of the temperature sensitive magnetic alloys known as ``calmaloy'' to the cold junction compensation of thermocouple temperature indicators. It has been known for some time that certain specially prepared copper-nickel alloys possess the property of changing permeability linearly with temperature over very wide ranges. This peculiar function of permeability has been advantageously used for effecting temperature compensation on different devices, particularly watthour meters. The need has recently arisen of providing suitable compensation for millivolt meters used in connection with thermocouples for determining the temperatures of air cooled aircraft motors. It is shown that by employing the restoring torque on the instrument produced by a small vane of calmaloy in addition to the usual restoring torque of the spring, a very satisfactory compensation results. Curves are shown which illustrate the accuracy of compensation obtained and a detailed explanation of just how it is accomplished is also given."
"This investigation was undertaken in order to determine the conditions of atmosphere under which the air capacitor may be regarded as having zero loss. A special guarded and shielded test capacitor was constructed having quartz insulation between the high-voltage and guard plates and low loss molded bakelite insulators between the measuring and guard plates. This capacitor was enclosed in a metal box and subjected to various conditions of temperature and humidity. Readings were made of continuous conduction current and a-c. phase defect angle. The measuring instruments used were the most sensitive available. A D' Arsonval galvanometer having a sensitivity of 1.5 × 10-12 amperes was used in the continuous current work and a Wien bridge sensitive to three seconds in the a-c. measurements. A gradient of approximately 4000 volts per cm. was used in all tests. Measurements were made of the effect of humidity at temperatures from 60 deg. fahr. to 100 deg. fahr. and in each run the humidity was varied from 40 to 95 per cent, approximately. Readings were made of continuous conduction current and the phase angle of the test capacitor was compared with that of a standard air capacitor in which the humidity was maintained at a low value. It was found that the conduction was zero and the phase defect angle of an air capacitor was less than three seconds for values of humidity below 90 per cent."
"Overhead transmission lines are usually considered to be a class of equipment subject to certain types of troubles which cannot be avoided by means accepted as ordinary practise. It is the purpose of this paper: (1) to describe improvements in design of wood pole lines of the 33,000-volt class, which improvements have been developed and applied to the system with which the authors have been identified and which, it is believed, will greatly reduce the characteristic troubles, (2) to present an explanation of flashovers on wood structures, (3) to give the facts found in field investigations which form the basis for the improvements adopted, and (4) to describe the method used for field investigations and analysis of troubles. The studies and investigations referred to deal primarily with the matter of insulation. Considerable information relative to the insulation values of wood in a structure as developed by laboratory tests has been published. Experience is cited in this paper to show the value of wood insulation in the structure developed from field experience on 33,000-volt lines, and there is presented a practical economical design of wood pole structures using wood braces, in place of the usual metal braces, which, it is believed, will be practically immune to lightning troubles. Data from laboratory tests are given to substantiate the conclusions developed in the field investigations. The performance of insulators with respect to mechanical and electrical breakage is shown and the use of insulators of more sturdy designs is discussed."
"This paper was written to review and extend the theory of overvoltages due to arcing grounds because of the increasing tendency to use impedances between the neutral point and the ground, thereby losing the advantage of the solidly grounded neutral. The ''third class conductor'' theory of Steinmetz is touched upon very briefly and is considered as not applying to transmission line conditions. The theory when the phenomenon is controlled by normal frequency arc extinction, as presented by Peters and Slepian, is reviewed and the maximum voltage for this analysis is found to be 3 ½ E, where E is the normal line to neutral voltage. The theory when the phenomenon is controlled by oscillatory frequency arc extinction as originated by Dr. Petersen is given in detail but in a modified and extended form. The maximum voltage for a single-phase circuit when no damping is considered is found to be 6 E. The analysis for the three-phase circuit is newly developed for the case in which there is an impedance between the neutral and ground and the maximum voltage is found to be 7 ½ E when the effect of the damping factors and capacitance between lines is neglected. The method of determining the various reductions or damping factors is outlined. The effect of a neutral grounding resistor is discussed and it is pointed out that a suprisingly high value of resistance can be used without incurring the possibility of dangerous overvoltages."
"The fused grading shield was developed primarily to reduce the number of outages due to insulator flashovers on transmission lines. Recent practise of reducing the insulation adjacent to terminals has increased the number of flashovers in these sections. The fused grading shield while not always economically feasible for entire lines provides a means of obtaining the reduced insulation without increased outages. Laboratory and field data are presented showing the characteristics of the device as well as the results of several years of operating experience."
"The first section of the paper contains a brief review of the general theory underlying the determination of extra copper losses in armature windings carrying alternating currents. Simplified methods of calculation are then described. The second part extends the study of the inverted turn transposition to the special case of three-phase windings having two phases connected in series to form a single-phase winding and the third phase left idle. Formulas and tables are presented to show what reductions in copper losses may be expected for this connection, and to aid in deciding what type of transposition is best for a given winding. The final section of the paper deals with the twisted lead transposition, and presents formulas and tables showing reductions in extra losses to be gained from this method of inversion and connection. Details of the derivations of the formulas and examples of the use of the twisted lead transposition are contained in appendices at the end of the paper."
"The ability of systems to withstand shocks, such as faults or switching operations, is much greater for small operating angles. The present paper has to do with system stability for small oscillations as contrasted with the more usual concept of stability as being its ability to withstand shocks. The analysis shows that synchronous machines without amortisseur windings and with no resistance in the armature are inherently stable for small oscillations in prime mover input or load output. With resistance in the armature, stability for such conditions is dependent upon load. A new proof is given for the relation previously derived by Nickle and Pierce which states that the limiting angle at which a machine becomes stable is tan -1 r/xq. Arguments are presented which show that any standard type of damper which may have been installed in generators for other incidental reasons, possesses the property of preventing spontaneous hunting except for the most abnormal conditions met in practise."
"This paper describes a motor which is developed specially for the operation of photophone machinery. The characteristics of this motor are analyzed and demonstrated by oscillograms. Since the well-known theory of synchronous and repulsion motor can easily be applied for this double motor, no equations are given. For illustration of the characteristics various oscillograms and test curves are given."
"Many induction motors do not have the smooth speed torque curves which are to be expected from elementary theory. Many motors at no load show a tendency to run at some speed way below that normally expected. This is sometimes called ``sub-synchronous'' speed, or the motor is said to be ``crawling.'' In the present paper one cause of this phenomenon is explained. It is found that certain combinations of phases, rotor slots, and poles cause the motor to run as a synchronous motor at some intermediate speed between zero and normal no-load induction motor speed. This effect has been christened the ``synchronous motor effect'' in induction machines and is shown to be due to the locking of harmonic fields, generated by the stator winding with similar harmonic fields, generated by the rotor windings. The method of avoiding this trouble by the proper selection of the number of rotor slots is given."
"This paper develops in as simple a manner as possible the necessity for the concept of ``differential leakage'' where transformer action takes place between two unequally distributed windings and explains the character of differential leakage. The value to be used for the transformer ratio in the case of such unequally distributed windings is also given. All considerations are based on the conventional stepped-wave field forms, and the mathematics used involve only the simplest linear equations. While the paper is mainly intended to be expository in nature, a general indication is given at the end as to how differential leakage and transformer ratios can be calculated for both single-phase and polyphase arrangements."
"By means of solutions of the induction motor exact equivalent circuit in the form of infinite power series, approximate formulas for the important motor characteristics are derived. These formulas enable the effects of magnetizing current, core loss, and primary resistance on maximum torque, starting current, and so forth, to be readily taken into account with engineering accuracy. A new form of power factor chart is presented, which enables the power factor-load curve of any motor to be conveniently determined from no load test data. Exact values of power factor can be obtained from the chart by applying differential corrections, formulas for which are given. The methods outlined were developed to secure an optimum combination of speed, accuracy, and consistency in design calculations, and have been in regular use for the past seven years."
"This paper enumerates the voltage irregularities which may occur in d-c. generators. It gives a description of these irregularities, the cause of their occurrence, the magnitude of their values, their effect on radio circuits, and states the problem encountered in their measurement. A method is described for the measurement of these voltage irregularities, by the use of an oscillograph, a blocking condenser, and a current transformer. A number of oscillograph records, illustrative of the voltage irregularities existent in various d-c. generators, is shown, and an analysis of the wave form made for each component of slow and fast ripple. These records were taken under various electrical and mechanical conditions of the generators. Comparisons between these records are made. Conclusions are drawn as to features desirable in d-c. generators."
"The Cooperative Idea has been the motivating spirit in the various attempts to bring together the educational and industrial elements in engineering. The outstanding milestones of progress in this undertaking are the ``Sandwich System'' of Scotland, the establishment of shops in schools, the rise of educational opportunities in industrial concerns, the report of Sir William White's committee of practising engineers and educators in England, and finally, the conception and inception of the cooperative courses at the University of Cincinnati and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These courses are taken as examples of two types of cooperative course called respectively the ``Cincinnati Plan'' and the ``M. I. T. Plan.'' Each of these possesses a structure and a set of operating principles determined by the purpose for which it was instituted and the conditions under which it is carried out. The operating principles of the M. I. T. Plan are discussed in detail in this paper. The graduates of both these plans are demonstrating that the results sought are being accomplished."
"This paper describes an instrument which was developed to make graphic records of generator revolutions and time as the generator slows down under the action of its losses during retardation tests. The construction of speedtime curves from the records thus obtained is outlined. The principle of numerical differentiation is discussed and its application to the determination of the slope of the speedtime curve is pointed out. A complete example illustrating the application of this principle is included in the paper."
"Previous network-computing devices with their uses and limitations are reviewed briefly, following which is a statement of the requisites for an effective a-c. calculating table. The M. I. T. Network Analyzer, a static miniature a-c. power system, designed and constructed jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the General Electric Company for the computation of actual power networks, is described in detail and its operation outlined. The fields of its application are enumerated and include the study of normal operating conditions, stability, and short circuits. An example illustrating its application to the solution of a normal-operation problem is given."
"This paper discusses the well-known calculation of the degree of protection afforded to a transmission line by ground conductors, on the assumption of the sudden disappearance of a vertical potential gradient caused by a charged cloud. Formulas are given for the protective ratio due to one and two ground conductors. It is shown that for any number of ground conductors, it is not necessary to compute the charges on the power conductors."
"The new construction described is intended to secure a sturdy and simple tower, not sensitive to irregularities in footing conditions; it is generally applicable where a horizontal arrangement of conductors is feasible. The tower consists of an articulated overhead transverse bridge carrying the conductors and hinged at the tops of the footings. Two or three intermediate towers are used between stabilizer towers. Transverse strength is secured by crossed internal ties and longitudinal stresses are taken up in the stabilizer towers by heavy guys and in the intermediate towers by the ground wires and conductors, which transmit these stresses to the stabilizer towers. The wide base structure thus secured has substantially no resultant uplift on the footings, offering a very large saving in foundation costs. This saving, together with the lesser material and erecting costs and the great ease with which it is adapted to varying ground conditions make this a very economical type of tower."
"The paper is intended to give a thorough explanation of step-by-step calculations of the synchronous rotor oscillations and other transients, which occur in electrical power systems when faults or other sudden changes take place. It is divided essentially into two parts. In Part I a descriptive illustration of the phenomena is given in order that the reader may visualize the conditions. In Part II general formulas are developed for calculations where any number of salient or non-salient pole machines are operating at various points on an impedance network. In Appendix I a special and simplified example is set up and analyzed. In Appendices II and III the numerical calculations of the swing curve for the special example in Appendix I are given, and a brief discussion is offered on the accuracy of this step-by-step method of calculation."
"The paper discusses the American end of the ship-to-shore radio telephone system and the connecting equipment on board the Leviathan. The most suitable wavelengths for this service are in the short-wave range, but the use of these wavelengths complicates the problem, since different wavelengths are required according to the distance of the ship from shore, the time of day, season of year, etc. The problem on shipboard is further complicated by the fact that the transmitting and receiving systems are necessarily near together and special precautions are necessary to take care of interference from the radio telephone transmitter and the radio telegraphic services. In addition to interference from these sources, there is a background of interference in the ship's electrical equipment, all of which necessitates a much more powerful land station than is necessary on shipboard. In the present system, the shore transmitter has a power rating of 15 kw. and the ship transmitter of 500 watts. The shore transmitting station is located at Ocean Gate, N. J., and the receiving station at Forked River, N. J. At both of these locations, directive antennas are employed which cover the ship's lanes. The stations are connected by wire to the Long Lines toll office in New York, and the over-all control of the circuit is carried out from this point. Both the ship and shore transmitters are crystal controlled. The ship's receiver is highly selective and is of the double-detection type."
"The object of this paper is to present the results of an investigation to determine the effect of resistors shunting current limiting reactors, on the impulse behavior of the typical system employing them. The typical system is reduced, without loss of essential generality, to a comparatively simple analytic network; and the impulse behavior of this network is then calculated mathematically. These calculations are adequately supported by test results with impulse generator and cathode ray oscillograph, both in the field and in the laboratory, and accurate agreement established. Methods are developed and illustrated for taking into account incident waves, such as those due to lightning, of arbitrary shape. Under the most unfavorable condition of wave shape and circuit conditions, voltages approaching four times that of the incident wave may be built up at the bus by reflections and oscillations. In general, through the use of a shunting resistor, of proper value, three beneficial results are obtained: (a) Oscillations are completely eliminated, thereby limiting the maximum voltage which can occur on the bus to never more than twice that of the incident wave. (b) The initial rise in voltage on the line side of the reactor, due to positive reflections, is reduced and can be held down to the final value corresponding to the tail of an infinite rectangular incident wave. (c) The internal oscillations in the reactor itself can be eliminated, and the voltage distribution improved."
"The results of theoretical and oscillographic study of transient voltage phenomena in shell type and core type transformers with neutral isolated from ground, and also with neutral grounded through impedances of different characteristics are briefly described. In the case of isolated neutral, the majority of lightning traveling waves cause the potential of the entire winding, including neutral, to rise above ground to a value at least equal to the applied voltage. In the case of switching surges, the voltage of the neutral, as well as of the rest of the winding, is apt to rise to a value considerably in excess of the applied voltage. In the case of transformers excited with damped oscillations similar to switching surges, oscillographic records of both shell and core type transformers indicate internal voltages to ground approximately four times the applied. Grounding of a transformer through resistance, inductance, or capacitance does not reduce the above internal transient voltages, unless a certain relation is established between these constants, the constants of the transformer circuit, and the wave shape of the line surge. If the proper relation of these constants is established, then internal transient voltages are reduced practically to those of a solidly grounded transformer. A grounding device, called an ``impedor,'' can be designed to have impedance at operating frequency equal to any desired value and to act at transient voltage frequencies as if its impedance were practically zero."

"A paper was presented in 1919, followed by Part II in 1921, giving a resumé of the relay protective systems up to those dates. The various important developments since 1921 warrant a third paper on this subject. There has been a general realization of the importance of shortening the time for removing a fault, and this has led to the production of high-speed circuit breakers combined with very fast relays, the total time of clearing trouble being reduced to from two to eight cycles. There is a tendency towards types of relays and schemes which are inherently selective in operation, such as the ``distance'' relays, balanced or differential schemes, pilot wire relays, etc. Due to the increased reliability of service and to the relative ease of obtaining selectivity and high speed of the relay protective system the growth of the use of parallel lines (usually in pairs) has been rapid. Back-up protection against through short circuits or failures of relays or breakers at the succeeding stations is growing in use and the necessary relays are being added unless the scheme adopted inherently has this covering protection. Due to its fundamental advantages of the detection of a fault in its incipient stage thereby reducing the voltage disturbance to the system, minimizing the damage at the fault, and reducing the stress on the circuit breakers ground protection is approaching the importance of becoming the first line of defense."
"During the past year or so, studies of stability have been made, to determine methods of preventing loss of synchronism upon the occurrence of faults. Of the several methods found, the most obvious and effective is the high speed isolation of the faulty section of the line; and this, of course, means high speed relays and high speed breakers. Investigation so far has indicated that the time required depends upon the type of fault. Since a three-phase short circutit prevents the flow of synchronizing power, it is the most serious type, and must be cleared in from 6 to 10 cycles. This demands the use of relays which will operate instantaneously. Recent suggestions have been numerous and these are discussed. This paper covers relays operating at normal frequency and those which have been operated or suggested for operation at higher superimposed frequencies. While there is a number of difficulties attendant on the design of high-speed relays, (these troubles depending on the type and construction of the relay), high speed relays may still be made to operate on any of the present well known principles such as, impedance principle, current balance principle, etc. They may employ either a mechanical structure or they may make use of thermionic or gas-filled tubes. Attention is given to a mechanical relay of the impedance type operating with a speed of one cycle or less."
"This paper deals with the paramount importance of ground protection on transmission systems which has been demonstrated by experience over the past few years. It presents the advantages of ground relays and shows that the disadvantages sometimes attributed to them are not well founded or have been overcome. A number of standard and special applications of relays for directional ground protection are described and illustrated by sketches showing connections. The application of these schemes is discussed and their desirability and feasibility supported by records of operating experience. Attention is called to the point that high-speed relaying will soon be an accomplished fact. High-speed relaying will be needed in both phase and ground protection to take full advantage of high breaker speed. In the testing of relays adequate test facilities are necessary to save time and to insure correct test results. Attention is called to the desirability of making staged tests at system voltage to insure correct relay operation and for their experimental value in developing improved forms of protection."
"In the application of various types of locomotives to switching service, it is at times quite desirable to have data concerning the energy requirements involved. A convenient figure for expressing such requirements in relation to work done is watt hours per ton-mile. The determination of such a figure involves certain difficulties peculiar to switching service, in that trailing loads and distances moved are continually varying. The electrified Oak Point Yard of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad in New York City offered an excellent opportunity for determining figures of watt hours per ton-mile for different kinds of switching. Accordingly two electric locomotives were equipped with the necessary instruments, and a total of 391/6 hr. of operation was observed and recorded. The paper describes in some detail the entire procedure of the tests and lists in tabulated form the data obtained. Basic figures necessary for calculating watt hours per ton-mile, it was found, could be expanded to give a much broader scope to the results, so that many interesting data became available. Incidentally, the data will permit of even further expansion where certain special figures or factors are desired. Although electric locomotives of different types were used, the results set forth in the paper should be considered without regard to either type. It is hoped that data concerning switching operations on other railroads may become available."
"A review is given of the development of self-propelled railway vehicles which utilize electrical transmission, paying particular attention to the ways and means of regulating the torque demand on the internal combustion engine which serves as the source of power, and the supply of power to the auxiliaries. Two general designs are discussed, and classified as ``differential field control'' and ``torque control.'' In differentiating between these two systems, two types of differential field control are outlined, giving their major advantages and limitations. The principle of torque control depending upon constant engine speed is discussed, enumerating its advantages over previous schemes. It permits the absorption of the entire engine output for any throttle opening and engine speed selected. The various relays and control devices necessary for proper operation of the scheme are described, together with the use of the auxiliary generator and main generator for compressor operation and battery charging. The appendixes deal with the design of auxiliary generators for differential field control and a short description of the method of limiting the torque required by means of a torque regulator and contactor. The problem of overcoming hunting of the system due to lagging of the field change and its solution are given. The differential field control comprises the minimum amount of apparatus consistent with operation of the car or locomotive and its auxiliaries."
"The use of electric transmission is almost a necessity with large internal combustion power plants in transportation service. Furthermore, the interposition of the electric transmission provides a method of obtaining what is the equivalent of a wide change in gear ratio, as well as a cushioning of the characteristic power impulses of the internal combustion engine. In adapting the internal combustion engine to this character of service there has been a number of problems, such as fitting the generator to the engine curve, the question of hand or automatic control, field control arrangements, single vs. multiple motor drive, and arrangement and operation of auxiliaries. The use of the combination generator-battery power plant has recently received considerable attention. This application employs a battery operating in parallel with the engine generator power plant, capable of supplementing the power of the engine for short periods. The characteristics of the engine used in transportation service must be well adapted to the duty required. These characteristics vary somewhat with the size of the unit and the control of the engine throttle is usually adapted to the particular problem in hand. In this paper, the principal problems connected with the operation and design of complete engine generator units are discussed in detail and many typical schemes of connection are diagrammatically shown."
"The selection and application of auxiliary electrical devices on a high-voltage multiple unit car is of almost as much importance as the application of the main traction apparatus and requires careful consideration. This paper contains a description of the engineering features as worked out for electrified suburban lines operating on 1500-volt and 3000-volt systems. The control circuits have become very generally standardized at 32-volts, which is also well adapted for interior illumination and headlights. A motor driven generator supplies 3-to 5-kw. power per unit for control lights and battery charging. Such devices as heaters and motor-generator sets, requiring a considerable amount of electrical power, are necessarily constructed to operate at trolley potential. On the 1500-volt system, the compressor can be operated directly from the line potential while on the 8000-volt systems, a double commutator motor driving the generator supplies a 1500-volt source of power for the compressor."
"The increasing demand for frequent and rapid transportation on both suburban and other railways has brought to the fore the multiple unit motor car. The steps taken in the development of the auxiliary equipment for the multiple unit motor coach are quite interesting, and have been made the subject of this paper. The first part of the paper is devoted to cars equipped with apparatus for converting the high-voltage d-c. overhead line current to the voltages required for operating standard auxiliary equipment. The second part is devoted to auxiliary equipment suitable for operation on the higher d-c. voltages now being used in more and more electrification projects. Although this paper refers mostly to development work carried out in Europe, it is nevertheless believed to be of interest to American engineers as the basic principles underlying this development are also applicable to American multiple unit cars."
"This paper deals primarily with the development, description, and characteristics of various types of rail bonds used at track joints for traction return and incidentally signal track circuits. It outlines their performance and reasons for their selection on representative electrified steam railroads, which include: Baltimore & Ohio Boston & Maine Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Delaware, Lackawannu & Western Illinois Central New York Central New York, New Haven & Hartford Norfolk & Western Pennsylvania Reading Virginian No attempt is made to discuss the track circuit characteristics and requirements for either signaling or propulsion return. Cross-bonding, impedance bonding, and structure grounds are also outside the scope of this paper. The track construction and maintenance, weight of rail, type of joints, condition of roadbed, ballast, traffic density and frequency, wheel loadings, amount of current to be carried, track signal circuit requirements, etc., all have a direct bearing on the design and proper application of the rail bond, which is thus a problem involving mechanical as well as electrical features. From the data submitted, an attempt is made to indicate the trend of bond design."
"The paper describes a varying frequency tele-metering system which employs an electron tube beat frequency oscillator, the frequency of which is controlled by a small condenser mounted upon the movement of the instrument, the reading of which is to be transmitted. The reading is reproduced at the receiving end by a frequency meter having a scale corresponding to that of the transmitting meter. The outstanding feature of this system, when furnishing a single indication, is that, except for the movements of the transmitting and receiving instruments themselves, there are no contacts or moving parts. The system does not require instruments of unusual type, and it is not limited to the transmission, only, of electrical readings, but may readily be applied to any deflection instrument indicating, for instance, pressure, temperature, etc. The accuracy of the system is not affected by changes in the impedance of the channel of transmission. The system is equally suitable for transmission over wire conductors or by means of carrier current or radio. A method of furnishing a number of telemetering indications over a single conducting circuit or carrier-current channel, is also described, which uses automatic telephone type selectors at transmitting and receiving stations. A feature of this system is that no synchronizing channel or synchronous power is required. By a system of impulses, the selectors automatically establish and maintain synchronism. A field installation which has given satisfactory results is described."
"This paper describes the conditions leading up to the development of the two-wire supervisory control system. It enumerates the outstanding requirements of supervisory control systems in general and indicates a number of the advantages of the two-Wire system. It provides a brief description of the operation of the system."
"This paper considers the application of centralized control of system operation of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in New Jersey. A brief history of events leading to the installation of supervisory system operation is given, with a detailed description of the apparatus and the methods used to carry out the indications, together with a statement as to what is being accomplished in improving the service."
"In the production of steel, the use of electrical energy is growing rapidly. This paper outlines the present operating conditions in the Monongahela Valley System of the Carnegie Steel Company. The use of automatic switching for certain portions of this power supply has proved both economical and satisfactory."
"A 1000-kw., 625-volt automatic mercury arc rectifier substation, installed by the Union Railway Co., of New York, in May, 1929, is described in general in this paper together with the account of the automatic and remote control features of the substations. The principle reasons for the adoption of the mercury arc rectifier are mentioned and operating and performance data for the first ten months' operation are presented."
"This paper points out the general progress made in the design of electric power systems and contrasts with it the lack of progress in the field of control switchboards. It is shown that due to this lack of progress a situation confronts many systems today where switchboards are so large that excessive amounts of space are necessary for their housing and further expenditures are later necessary in order to integrate these large switchboards so as to bring them within proper supervisory control of a limited number of operators. A development in miniature switchboards is described embracing and containing all the fundamental requirements of a control switchboard and yet with no greater space than 4 in. of panel width for complete control and supervision of one feeder. A description of the instrument, control switches, and auxiliary relays is given as well as the method in which all these elements have been assembled. Drawings and photographs of actual installations showing the possibility of developing a switchboard along the lines described, that will handle 60 feeders and yet bring it within the range and operating control of a single operator, are given. The advantages of the new development are, as brought out: Compactness, ease of operation, closer supervision, ease of erection, good appearance, and modernity."
"This paper describes some of the results of the work of the Joint Development and Research Subcommittee of the National Electric Light Association and Bell Telephone System on the mutual impedances of ground-return circuits. The first part of the paper deals with some experiments which were performed to establish an experimental background for the testing of theoretical ideas. Different theories, one involving an ``equivalent ground-plane,'' a second a d-c. distribution in the earth, and a third an a-c. distribution in the earth, are discussed in the light of the experimental results. While none of these is adequate to explain all the observed phenomena, each has a field in which it can be made useful. The second part of the paper is devoted to a description of practical means for predetermining the mutual impedances of power and telephone lines. This involves an experimental determination of a curve of mutual impedance as a function of separation in the region of the proposed exposure and the calculation of the over-all mutual impedance between the proposed lines from this curve and the dimensions of the exposure. The results of trials of this method in two locations are given which indicate that it should be of sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes."
"This paper deals with new forms of Lichtenberg figures produced under the combined stress of dielectric and magnetic fields. The effects produced by the magnetic field may be used for determining whether electrons, positive ions, or protons. are basically the active elements in the formation of the positive as well as the negative figures. The photographs also show that the presence of the magnetic field greatly extends the range of air pressures within which figures of definite form can be obtained; that figures taken at low air pressures possess structures strikingly different from those hitherto known; and that these figures may prove a key to the mechanism of the electric spark."
"This paper describes a survey made to determine the range of magnitudes of room noise present in telephone locations. Measurements were made in a total of 250 locations in New York City and environs, distributed among businesses and residences in accordance with telephone traffic distribution. In each location, measurements were made by a marginal audibility method using the human ear as a part of the measuring device, and by a visual indicating meter. A brief description is included of the apparatus employed with each of these methods. Results are presented for measurements made in various classes of rooms, under winter and summer conditions."
"Power requirements of the Commission's 25-cycle Niagara System are outlined. Preliminary studies in connection with the choice of transmission voltage, location of terminal transformer station, etc. are discussed, together with the technical studies involved in the design of a system for transmitting 260,000 hp., 230 mi. at 220,000 volts, and transforming same at the receiving end, for interconnection with the existing 110,000-volt system. The Toronto-Leaside 220,000-volt transformer station is described, including the 220,000-volt switching arrangement, 45,000-ky-a. three-winding transformer banks, 110,000-and 13,200-volt switching arrangements, 25,000-kv-a. vertical-shaft out-door synchronous condensers, relaying, communication, and control. The 220,000-volt transmission system is also described, including the use of aerophotography in surveying the route and locating the towers, design of supporting structures, details of conductor supports, insulation, ground wire practise, etc. The paper concludes with a résumé of operating experience on the 220,000-volt system to date, and an outline of the future development of the system as at present anticipated."
"This paper deals mainly with a more general and systematic method of handling certain classes of problems involving steady state transmission calculations in terms of real quantities than has hitherto been used. Part I is introductory, however, and shows that the binary linear transformation which the writer showed in 1919 to exist for all ladder circuits in terms of complex quantities, and with determinant unity, occurs also in operational form for the general input-output network and likewise with determinant unity, thus including sine-wave as a particular case. Part II views the general case of input-output circuits under sine wave conditions as a quaternary linear transformation in real quantities, likewise with determinant unity, but subject to a certain condition (``absolute covariant''). The subject matter involves on equal terms voltage-squared (z), current-squared (w), power (x), reactive voltamperes (y) for both input and output ends in the general circuit, and in the special case of a transmission line per se it also introduces mean values of these quantities throughout the length of the line, suggesting the engineering importance of some of them. For this latter purpose the sixteen real coefficients of the transformation are given as functions of s the length of the line leading to their mean values as tabulated. Twenty identities involving values of the ``a-set'' of coefficients are given which are useful for checking numerical values and simplifying unnecessarily cumbrous results. The relations between the ``a-set'' and the ``b-set'' coefficients are given."
"Cathode ray oscillographic tests were made of traveling waves passing from an overhead line into short lengths of cable. Single-phase cable lengths of 500 and 1000 ft. were used. Tests were made with a wide variety of conditions, such as cable at end of line, cable between two sections of line, etc. The tests demonstrated that a short length of cable does not act as an effective protective device when connected between station and incoming line. When the traveling wave on the incoming line has a long flat top, several times the cable length, the crest of the wave passing the cable is decreased only a few per cent by the presence of the cable, although the wave-front is sloped off if it was originally very steep. When the wavelength is approximately the same as the cable length, the cable can reduce the transient voltage to less than half of the value without the cable. Recent measurements on transmission lines show that waves do occur with approximately flat tops which are several thousand feet in length. Therefore the cables do not permit the omission of lightning arresters which are means of reducing the potential of overvoltage surges. This confirms the theoretical calculations and the practise of using lightning arresters with cables. The resistance of the ground connection of the cable sheath was found to have important effects. With the cable sheath at the end grounded through 28 ohms, a potential of 82 kh."
"The phenomenon of dancing cables is discussed; the merits of different theories are considered, reference being made to the theory that vibrations of small amplitude, but relatively high frequency, travel along the line to points where the constants of the line change as at dead-ending insulators and there reflect and combine into slower waves of great amplitude. The suggestion is made that much experimental work should be done with regard to these theories before drawing any definite conclusions. Reference is made to Magnus effect and to the ``lift'' of ice-coated cables in wind storms. This lift, perpendicular to the direction of the wind, is carefully considered, and diagrams show experimental values of this lift on models similar to the ice-coated cables. The diagrams indicate variations and reversals of this thrust due to small changes of angle of the specimen to the direction of the wind. The suggestion is made that these alternate lifting and depressing effects should be considered as the cause of some, if not a large percentage, of the phenomenal movements of ice-coated conductors in relatively light winds. As in most earlier reports and discussions there does not seem to be any remedy as a result of this study, other than that of heating the conductor electrically throughout sleet-forming periods to such a temperature that the sleet cannot form on the wires."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a logical basis for the insulation of transmission lines and substations using as a basis the characteristics of traveling waves produced by lightning discharges. The method presented was formulated from the data obtained from the cathode ray oscillograms of actual line surges and upon the laboratory work in which the impulse flashover characteristics of insulating structuires was determined. 7' he breakdown volt-time characteristics of various forms of insulation are presented. Using these curves of various forms of gaps in the known characteristics of traveling waves, insulation of the transmission line at various distances from the gap is determined so that flashover will be znlikely to occur at these points. A similar method of analysis is made upon substations and lines protected by lightning arresters, but with the known characteristics of lightning arresters, the insulation on the line up to points 1000 to 5000 ft. away can be apportioned so that the lightning arrester will take the discharge, preventing the flashover of insulation. The system set forth in the paper enables the transmission engineer to design the line and stubstation in an economical manner and obtain adeqiuate protection for all points desired."
"The law of time lag and impulse breakdown is derived from experimental data. This law, which appears to be rational, shows that a given amount of energy is required to cause. breakdown of a given gap and that voltage and time are interdependent. It is quite in accord with the work in the original paper and applies to breakdown on rectangular waves, on the front of slanting waves, or to overvoltages on standard waves.1 By means of simple formulas the results for any wave can be calculated or the effects of different waves correlated. Three general types of impulse tests, dependent on the form of wave used and the spark-over point selected, are discussed as follows: 1. The so-called \"rectangular\" wave with spark-over on the top 2. The uniformly rising voltage with spark-over on fronts of various slopes 3. The use of a \"standard\" wave of logarithmic front and tail with spark-over occurring at any desired point on it. Method 3, using the full standard wave, is by far the simplest to apply and gives the most consistent results. It is also shown that it may be used in a way to give effects equivalent to the other two methods. Interesting energy relationships for impulse failures of gaps are brought out in this connection. Field experience with actual lightning waves is compared to laboratory results with the \"standard\" wave and found to check very closely."
"This paper, prepared with the cooperation of the members of the Insulator and Lightning Subcommittee, points out the present need for rationalizing transmission system strength on the basis of lightning voltage. The higher grade of service demanded of transmission systems today requires fewer interruptions. It is pointed out that for a four year period the line interruptions due to lightning on an extensive 132-ky. network average 75 per cent of all line outages. Apparatus failures due to lightning, while not numerically great, can be materially reduced, if the system insulation is coordinated on the lightning basis. Over-insulation of lines has been tried in some cases, particularly on wood pole lines, with varying degrees of success in reducing line outages. But this method of attacking the lightning problem does not consider the protection of station equipment where the most costly apparatus is subject to damage, and where apparatus damage may result in long service outage. It is pointed out that additional knowledge is necessary on lightning strengths of insulation and apparatus to rationalize system voltage strengths on a lightning basis. This information is gradually being secured by various groups working on the problem. To aid in solving the lightning problem it is proposed a set of standard test waves be adopted by which insulation and apparatus, if possible, may be tested."
"The danger of over-insulating transmission lines without a corresponding increase in the insulation of connected apparatus is pointed out. To avoid trouble from lightning reaching the apparatus, the Transformer Subcommittee of the Electrical Machinery Committee has prepared a set of proposed rules covering: (1) A practical method of defining the impulse strength of transformers, and (2) recommendation on coordinating the transformer and adjacent line insulation on the basis of impulse voltage strength. It is pointed out that commercial methods for determining the impulse strength of transformer windings by acceptance test in the factory are not feasible. However, investigations in the laboratory show that the impulse strengths of transformer insulation and of standard line insulators or of air-gaps vary similarly with different forms of waves; also that the impulse ratio of strings of line insulators of different lengths is approximately constant for the same impulse waves. The forms of impulse waves actually occurring on transmission lines have not been fully determined. For these reasons the impulse strength of transformers is expressed in terms of the 60-cycle dryflashover voltage of non-shielded suspension type insulators. If the transformer and line insulation are properly balanced with a given wave, it eliminates the necessity of having to consider the different shapes of waves encountered in practise."
"The factors having influence on insulation design of transmission line and station are briefly reviewed, and it is pointed out that the progress of the art does not yet allow of close design of the insulation structure for insulation strength. The prominent part played by the lightning arrester is stressed, and the fact that it has a marked effect on the coordination of station insulation. Examples of a typical 110-kv. station where no coordination was made, and of a 220-kv. station where a deliberate coordination was attempted, are given, as well as the experience obtained with each."
"This paper presents the reasons and the evidence which have influenced the authors to favor the proposed Recommendations on Relation of Transformer Insulation to Adjacent Line Insulation set forth in a companion paper by Messrs. Montsinger and Dann. The paper first outlines the principal considerations which govern the determination of transmission line insulation on the one hand and transformer insulation on the other, and concludes that the line insulation is a service problem requiring a unique solution whereas the transformer insulation is a manufacturing problem requiring a standardized solution. True coordination of the one with the other therefore seems impossible, indicating the need for protective measures at the point of contact. Considerations affecting the selection and characteristics of such protective measures are discussed briefly and the reasons outlined for believing that, at present, service experience is a better criterion than research tests upon which to decide such selection. Twenty-five years' service experience on the system now controlled by the Buffalo, Niagara and Eastern Power Corporation, with protective gaps similar to those recommended as one of the proposed protective measures, is described and the conclusion drawn that the use of such gaps under suitable conditions constitutes a satisfactory protective measure."
"Generated, switching, and lightning surge voltages all influence the design and application of insulation. The first two might logically be taken as the bases for determining the minimum insulation levels at stations; also, for lines where lightning is not encountered. Since lightning voltages affect service primarily through their influence on lines, the insulation strengths suitable for the lines may bear little relation to the insulation strengths of the stations. Several lightning insulation levels are proposed for the coordination of line, station, and apparatus insulation; the basic or lowest level (determined by consideration of generated and switching surge voltages), being established by the line insulation or spillway gaps at the line station entrances, when the line is at a higher level; the busses and connections would constitute the next higher level; the apparatus bushings next; and finally, the apparatus internals. More complete data on the nature of transient voltages as they originate and are modified by the circuit, and the performance of insulation with these voltages applied, are required before insulation can be coordinated with assurance. During the interim it should be possible to accomplish substantial improvement to service by applying to specific cases as they arise, the knowledge and data already available and being gathered, along the general lines proposed in the paper."
"The rapid growth of the telephone cable network in this country has made it desirable to develop a system whereby this network may be utilized to transmit programs for broadcasting stations over distances upwards of 2000 miles. Such a system has recently been developed and given a trial on a looped-back circuit 2200 miles long with very satisfactory results. It transmits ranges of frequency and volume somewhat in excess of those now handled by the open-wire circuits which are used for program work, and also in excess of those handled by present-day radio broadcasting systems when no long distance lines are involved. The paper deals first with the transmission requirements of broadcasting systems and then gives a description of this new cable system."
"Values of the primary transmission constants R, L, G, and C for open-wire telephone lines are presented, and the factors which affect these constants in practise are discussed. Consideration is then given to the constants which are of principal interest in telephone work, namely, the attenuation, the characteristic impedance, the phase constant, and the velocity of propagation. Data regarding these characteristics are given for the frequency range from 0 to 50,000 cycles."
"This paper discusses the major factors contributing to the (total) leakage conductance of telephone line insulators, especially at carrier frequencies up to 50,000 cycles. The influence of both the design and material of the insulators and pins on each factor is discussed and illustrated by test data. The electrical performance of three different designs is analyzed to illustrate, in a general way, the relative importance of the several factors."
"This paper outlines a comprehensive plan for improved switching of long haul toll telephone traffic in the United States and eastern Canada. A brief discussion is given of the methods of designing the toll plant to give adequate transmission efficiency for all connections established in accordance with this plan, including a new method of providing amplification at intermediate switching points replacing the cord circuit repeater method."

"A two-way television system, in combination with a telephone circuit, has been developed and demonstrated and is now in use between the Bell Telephone Laboratories, at 463 West Street, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 195 Broadway. With this system two people can both see and talk to each other. It consists in principle of two television systems of the sort described to the Institute in 1927. Scanning is by the beam method, using disks containing 72 holes, in place of 50 as heretofore. Blue light, to which the photoelectric cells are quite sensitive, is used for scanning, with a resultant minimizing of glare to the eyes. Water-cooled neon lamps are employed to give an image bright enough to be seen without interference from the scanning beam. A frequency band of 40,000 cycles width is required for each of the two television circuits. Synchronization is effected by transmission of a 1275-cycle alternating current controlling special synchronous motors rotating 18 times per second. Speech transmission is by microphone and loud speaker concealed in the television booth so that no telephone instrument interferes with the view of the face."
"Rotating machines directly connected to overhead lines are subject to damage from lightning surges. Many methods of protection against such damage are possible, several of which are discussed in this paper. Laboratory experiments have been made to show the normal distribution under various steepnesses of waves, and the improvement of unsatisfactory distributions by means of condensers or lightning arresters connected to various parts of the windings has been studied."
"Experience has shown that rotating machinery connected directly to overhead lines is more vulnerable to surges than many other types of apparatus. This fact together with a desire on the part of some to connect important units to the line in this manner, has necessitated a study of the protection problem. Such a study is here described, showing oscillograms taken when steep voltage surges were applied to machine windings, measuring internal voltages to ground which are 200 per cent of the voltage allowed by the terminal lightning arrester. A simple traveling wave analysis of these oscillations is developed, which has successfully explained the peculiarities of over 400 oscillograms taken under various terminal conditions. Practical methods of eliminating th. e oscillations with neutral impedance are outlined in the light of the theory developed, and oscillographic evidence supporting their reliability is given. A generalized theory of neutral protection is proposed. The importance of wave-front, surge impedance of incoming line, arrester resistance, and other factors is discussed. Methods for protection of the turn insulation and the insulation to ground of such machines are suggested, showing that the lightning arrester only limits the potential of waves entering the machine and cannot control oscillations which may take place within the machine. The advantages of thyrite as a neutral resistor are pointed out in connection with the short-circuit protection, telephone interference, and lighting protection problems of such machines."

"This paper deals with the design and operating characteristics of the East River Generating Station of the New York Edison Company. This station, having an ultimate capacity of 1,240,000 kw., occupying as it does a site approximately a quarter of a mile long by 200 ft. wide, presents a number of design and operating features which are a departure from normal practise. Among the items of particular interest are: 1. The location of all of the circulating water pumps in a pit at the river end of the station, each set of pumps supplying its condenser through cast iron circulating water pipes six feet in diameter. 2. The adoption of steam turbine drive for the essential auxiliaries. 3. The adoption of pulverized fuel firing in what had hitherto been an exclusively stoker territory. 4. The burning of pulverized coal in a completely water cooled furnace containing practically no refractories. 5. The use of the largest boiler yet built. 6. The first use of a double winding generator which is also the largest generator in operation. The paper presents some of the major considerations influencing the decisions reached on these items of design and the extent to which the expectations of the designers have been realized."
"This paper represents the impressions of a European trip made during the summer of the year 1929 and gives a comparative study of the conditions of European development in so far as they are either of a particular interest or different from the conditions in the United States. The advance made in Europe in the low head developments is attributed in a large part to the advanced work made in the European hydraulic laboratories and to the cooperation between the laboratory and the manufacturer of hydraulic equipment and power plant designer. The advances made in the design of the large units of Propeller and Kaplan turbines are discussed. The low head developments are stressed as the most interesting, and a short description is given of the plants in the region of the upper Rhine and the international interconnection system of this region. The extensive pumping schemes of this region are briefly described. An attempt is made to outline the power house design tendencies and the new ideas in protecting the river bed from erosion. The more interesting work done in the hydraulic laboratories is described. A short comparison between the mixing and placing of concrete as done in Europe and in the States is given."

"Charles Edward Skinner, Assistant Director of Engineering, Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co., a Manager of the Institute 1915–19 and one of its Vice-Presidents 1919–20, was born on a farm near Redfield, Ohio, May 30, 1865. He was educated at Ohio University and Ohio State University, being graduated from the latter with a M. E. degree with the class of 1890. He worked his way through the University, partly as a helper at the Ohio Experimental Station Dairy and partly as a machinist in the University shops. In August, after graduating in June, he joined the organization of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company as a machinist in charge of the manufacture of railway controllers and supervised the construction of the first controllers turned out by the Westinghouse Company. Early in 1891 he was asked to undertake the development of a system for the testing of insulation: this required the development of testing apparatus, testing methods, and later he was put in charge of all insulation design, as well as testing."
"In the operation of an electric power distributing system involving various hinds of networks, a fundamental necessity is that each transforming and transmitting unit carry a reasonable share of the total load. In the case of a single system that has been developed in a coordinated manner the problem of load division has not in general been troublesome and has been solved by judicious selection of parallel circuits, use of reactors, proper system set-up, etc. The advent of inter-company connections has brought together systems of varying characteristics, changed the relation between the basic elements involved, and in some cases has made difficult the control of power flow over tie lines small in comparison to the systems which they unite. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the case of load control where closed rings or parallel path circuits are involved. After briefly reviewing the principles of voltage phase angle and power flow, a description is given of some actual tests performed on a very large interconnected system with a 250-mi. transmission loop, involving five power companies and a total generator capacity well over 1,000,000 kw. The results of these measurements are analyzed for the purpose of checking theoretical against actual values and forming a basis for the solution of problems of a similar nature."
"A brief review of the welding developments during the year 1929 prepared by a Committee of the American Welding Society gives considerable information in regard to the application of arc welding to structural work."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the application of the watt-oscillograph to the study of the performance of rotating a-c. machinery under transient conditions. Some typical transient cases are presented with a view to illustrating the possibilities of such an application. The analysis of a film taken with the watt-oscillograph yields not only power but current and power factor also. It is thus possible, for the case of sinusoidal voltages and currents, to determine the locus of the current vector as it changes from one position to another. The paper also describes the watt elements of the oscillograph developed for this study, with data as to the degree of accuracy that may be expected from them. An outline of the method of analyzing an oscillogram so as to obtain the performance curves and the current locus is also given."
"The extent of transatlantic telephone service and its growth since its inception in 1937 are outlined in this paper. It is pointed out that at the present time 85 per cent of the world's telephones are included in the area served and about 50 calls are made per business day. Analysis is given of the calls with respect to distribution by countries, by time of day, and by kind of message. The volume of calls, the rates, and the percentage of uninterrupted calls are given. Plans for future extensions of the service are outlined."
"This paper discusses the butt welding of steel sheets by the carbon arc process. It explains first that autogenous welding is divided into two main classes, viz., gas and electric; that electric arc welding is divided into two classes, viz., metallic and carbon arc. Gas and metallic arc welding in general require beveling of plates for butt welds while carbon arc welding does not. The controlling variables in carbon arc welding are (1) amperes in the arc, (2) voltage across the arc, (3) magnetic field about the arc, (4) atmosphere about the arc, (5) speed of feed, and (6) filling-in material. Discussion is given of the effect of each of these variables of the resulting weld with special reference to the action of a magnetic field parallel to the direction of the arc upon the current in the arc and the effect of the atmosphere about the arc on the ductility of the resulting weld."
"An instrument for measuring ultra violet radiation is described in this paper. The general plan of the meter is explained and a description of a small portable instrument is given. By means of proper choice of cells, as described in the paper, radiations of different desired frequencies may be measured."
"The low-voltage a-c. network utilizing secondary network protectors has been adopted by five properties of the Standard Gas and Electric Company for service in areas of high-load density. The system has been applied to cities of the second class and smaller, although load density in certain cases is high. Each individual installation was made after a specific study of conditions involved. Underlying principles on which all of the designs are based are: (1) Primary supply at generator voltage (11-kv. or 13-kv.), (2) omission of feeder regulators, (3) simplified transformer vault design with barrier wall between primary and secondary equipment, (4) high-reactance transformers, usually inherent, (5) use of secondary network protectors, (6) three-phase four-wire secondaries, (7) use of 250,000-cir. mil. secondary mains (or smaller) forming a solid grid without fuses. The operating experience of the installations made thus far has justified their application. The use of the system in other areas will be considered in future planning."

Y. It also explains the function of the various machines, points out the more important features of the control, and relates a few interesting incidents in the past eighteen months of operation."

"In a previous paper, the writers published results on the dielectric strength of various glasses and concluded that for ordinary thicknesses there were three distinct types of breakdown. The present paper emphasizes the fact that this is true not only for glass but also for fused quartz and for celluloid. By the elimination of edge-effect, the following breakdown gradients were obtained: For celluloid, 2,500,000 volts/cm.; for glass, 3,100,000 to 5,000,000 volts/cm.; and for mica, 10,600,000 volts/cm. The various methods of eliminating edge-effect are discussed and compared and an attempt is made to correlate the electrical properties of the glasses with their chemical composition."
"The paper outlines the fundamentals of a carrier communication system over a transmission network. A description of the installations on a 132-kv. network having an extent of 2500 linear miles is given and the general experience with carrier, which is the sole means of communication used by the power companies on that system, is outlined. Extensive experience with various types and makes of coupling capacitors is described. Experience with the protective system, the lead-in system, the tuning used in connection with the coupling, the transmitting system, and the receiving system is given. Definite data are cited as to cost, maintenance, reliability, traffic, and safety."
"The theory of synchronous machines as developed by Doherty and Nickle1 has been extended to include a determination of the effect of armature circuit resistance on damping torque. Equations are developed for the damping torque of synchronous machines in general, i. e., both the salient-pole and round rotor types. These equations assume an exciting winding in the direct axis and an amortisseur winding in the quadrature axis, and further assume that all damping is due to currents induced in these two windings. The effect of an amortisseur winding in the direct axis is not considered because its damping action at the low frequency of hunting is small compared to that of the exciting winding. It is shown that the damping torque of any synchronous machine can become negative, giving instability, if the armature resistance is increased beyond a critical limiting value. This fact has been known,2 but an actual determinination of the value of the critical resistance in terms of constants of the machine has not, to the authors' knowledge, been available. For a salient-pole generator with normal excitation and no amortisseur winding this value, is $r = x_{q} \\tan \\delta' $ where r is armature circuit resistance,† xq is quadrature synchronous reactance, and δ′ is the steady-state displacement angle. If r is less than the critical limiting value, the damping torque is positive; if greater, negative. The damping of a generator increases in the positive direction with increase in load. Thus a salient-pole generator with amortisseur winding, if stable at no load, will be stable under any steady load within its steady-state power limit. With δ′ = 0, and normal excitation, the critical limiting value of armature resistance for a machine with an armotisseur winding is $r = \\sqrt {b \\, d + {d \\over b}} (x_{d} - a)^{2}$ where xd is the direct synchronous reactance and a, b, d are constants depending upon the design of the machine. This formula is useful for determining the constants of an amortisseur winding which would prevent sustained or cumulative oscillations of a generator. The analysis also shows that a round-rotor generator with identical field windings in the direct and quadrature axes may be made unstable by too much resistance in the armature circuits. This fact had been previously established by Dreyfus.2 The relations for inherent stability in synchronous motors are not so simple as for generators, but definite relations involving armature resistance will be found in the article. The mathematical analysis is checked with laboratory experiments."
"The present paper describes an attempt to determine the distribution of energy in the electric arc by the calorimetric method. The total energy input to the arc was measured by a specially calibrated watthour meter. The energy dissipated at the anode and at the cathode was estimated by the temperature rise of the electrodes, which was measured by mercury thermometers. In experiments with the iron, copper, and carbon arcs, the anode and cathode were of the same weight and shape and were provided with an identical heat insulation. Since the ratio between the energies dissipated at the anode and at the cathode was made independent of the losses by radiation and the absolute values of energies involved, its determination was made with sufficient accuracy. In the case of iron or copper arcs in air this ratio was found to be practically unity. The presence of different fluxes alters the distribution of energy between the anode and cathode. In the case of an arc maintained between graphite electrodes, the energy at the anode was much higher than that at the cathode."
"Line grounds on the secondary of an auto-transformer, fed from a grounded system, tend to invert the neutral of the auto-transformer. If the auto-transformer is isolated, this may lead to larger voltages, and if grounded, to larger currents than what would ordinarily be expected. The analysis of an important installation (75,000-kv-a., three-phase units at Detroit) is given below, for various possible connections and conditions of operation. Features of the analysis are: (A) A novel theory and method of auto-transformer circuit representation was developed to handle some aspects of this problem that otherwise appeared elusive.2 The method is applicable to all networks involving auto-transformers. (B) The rather startling fact is brought out and explained that fault currents to ground on the secondary lines of an auto-transformer may be larger when stepping-up than when stepping-down. The prediction has been verified by test."
"This paper presents an analysis of the sub-synchronous speed phenomena of a salient-pole synchronous motor in which formulas and equivalent circuits are developed making it possible to calculate the torque and current for a broad range of conditions. Equations in terms of the impedances of the direct and quadrature axes are first derived from the revolving field point of view. The equivalent circuits for the two axes are then set up and expressions for the separate impedances of the circuit elements established. Adequate means of taking into account the combined effects of salient poles, incomplete amortisseur windings, and open or closed field windings are presented. The results obtained are illustrated by a comparison of the predicted performance and test data for a large 60-pole motor. The calculated distribution of current between the amortisseur bars of the same motor is shown by curves. Other curves show the calculated performance of the motor with and without continuous end rings between the poles and with the field winding open and closed. A final example shows the theoretical effects of changing the positions of the bars in the poles of a large waterwheel generator."

"A report on a proposed American Standard for Graphical Symbols for Electric Power and Interior Wiring developed by a subcommittee of the Sectional Committee on Scientific and Engineering Symbols and Abbreviations was received at the December 13, 1929 meeting of the A. I. E. E. Standards Committee and was ordered printed in report form for distribution for purposes of criticism and suggestion. This report comprises graphical symbols used for one-line and complete diagrams of electric power apparatus, instruments and relays, system-connection diagrams, and interior wiring diagrams. The symbols are limited to apparatus usually met with in electrical power engineering, such as major electrical equipment in power houses, substations, and transmission and distribution systems and to system and building wiring diagrams. They are not intended to cover communication, railway or other allied branches of electrical engineering. Basic symbols seem to have widespread use and application, and only such symbols are given. This report will shortly be available in pamphlet form and copies may be had without charge by writing H. E. Farrer, Secretary, A. I. E. E. Standards Committee, 33 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y."

"Giuseppe Faccioli, Associate Manager and Works Engineer for the General Electric Company of Pittsfield, Mass., Manager of the Institute 1918–22, and one of its Vice-Presidents 1922–24, was born in Rome, Italy, in 1877. In 1899 he was graduated with high honors from the Institute of Technology, Milan, Italy, as a mechanical and electrical engineer. He spent the first years of his career in designing a-c. machinery."
"This paper discusses a proposal, sponsored by the Transformer Subcommittee of the Committee on Electrical Machinery, which is intended to serve as a guide in operating transformers by temperature rather than in accordance with their nameplate ratings. There is a real difference between “rating standards” and “recommendations for operation;” one simply specifies the measure of a machine under a definite set of conditions and the other constitutes a guide for loading under the varying conditions of actual service. With this difference in mind, a departure from the practise of the Institute up to this time is suggested; namely, that these operating recommendations be placed in an appendix of the Standards and considered not as rating standards but purely as a guide in loading transformers which have been designed to meet the Standards of Rating. One of the first things that had to be done in framing these recommendations was to setae the maximum safe limiting temperature of the windings for operation in actual service. The aim in making this selection was to provide for reasonable deterioration of the insulation and therefore a reasonably long life for the transformer. For reasons disclosed in this paper, a limiting temperature of 95 deg. cent. was adopted. This limit is 10 deg. below that used in the Standards for Rating. These are the high points of the proposal. But opinion on these matters seems to be rather divided throughout the industry, and the purpose of this paper is to bring them to the attention of all members of the Institute."
"Magnetic noise in induction motors is caused by the vibration of magnetic parts produced by the varying forces associated with the changing flux density in the adjacent air parts of the magnetic circuit. Torsional vibration of the motor is caused by unbalanced windings or applied voltages. Vibration of the rotor simulating a mechanically unbalanced rotor is caused by two fields differing by two poles and not of the same frequency or direction of rotation. Vibration of the stator by distortion from a circular shape results from the presence of other simple combinations of fields. Teeth tend to vibrate axially at double applied frequency. The magnetic noise produced by a motor can be predicted from a qualitative analysis of the air-gap field supplemented by an approximate quantitative analysis and consideration of the stiffness of the parts."
"The long distance telephone office serves to provide a concentration point for intercity telephone communication from a group of local exchanges, and its size mil depend largely upon the number of stations served by the local offices. The Chicago toll office, which serves 1,200,000 stations, recently has been replaced largely with new equipment. This equipment, together with correlated improvements in handling toll service at Chicago, is described in this paper. The work of the toll operator in handling toll calls with the new equipment is compared with the former method. It is this change in operating practise which constitutes a major improvement in long distance service. The paper also includes d description of the toll lines entering Chicago, with their equipment arrangements including telephone repeaters, the power plants required to operate this equipment and that associated with the switchboards. The addendum describes the purpose of the auxiliary and special switchboards which are required in large installations only, such as those in Chicago."
"The well-known circle diagram of a transmission network is applied to electrical machinery, giving circle diagrams of alternators, synchronous motors, synchronous condensers, and transformers. These diagrams give a graphical representation of the machine performance under all possible conditions. Such quantities as power loss, lower input, power output, field current., etc., for any operating condition, can be obtained by inspection. These diagrams have the same field of usefulness as the circle diagram of the inductionmotor. The transmission network circle diagram can be applied to the induction motor, yielding in the approximate representation the Heyland diagram, which is merely a special case of the more general diagram. The transmission network method of attack gives a straight-forward solution to many induction motor problems that would otherwise be difficult to handle; such as a motor equipped with a phase advancer."
"A proposition to introduce a change in the units of the magnetic circuit was made at the meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission, (I. E. C.) in Bellagio, September 1927. The proposition was referred to an international subcommittee for consideration and report, by the Advisory I. E. C. Committee on Nomenclature. The subcommittee has recently reported, recommending that the matter be placed on the agenda of the next I. E. C. meeting, and that in the meanwhile, the subject should be discussed in all the national committees, more especially in the various electrical engineering societies, so as to pave the way for well considered international action. This paper has been prepared in the hope of presenting the questions definitely, with a view to eliciting discussion and opinions that may be helpful from the international point of view. As an aid to the formulation of views on the subject among those who may not have given special attention to the historical development of the magnetic-circuit units, a short outline of their history is here submitted."
"Heat dissipation is an ever-present factor affecting the design and operation of many kinds of electrical equipment. Usually, the problem is to get rid of heat due to losses. Sometimes the problem is how to conserve heat. Radiation, or convection, or conduction, or combinations of these, enter into all cases. Engineering literature as a rule presents conduction and convection in sound terms but in many cases, the treatment of radiation is unsound, misleading, and sometimes in error. This paper is presented with the hope of putting heat radiation in engineering applications on a sounder basis. The usual laws given to cover total heat radiation are slated and discussed, and their limitations brought out. Net heat loss by radiation interchange for the cases of parallel and concentric surfaces are reviewed and stated. The problem of total radiation from a rectangular slot is attacked, the method of solution is indicated by example and discussion, and the results given."
"This paper describes an investigation of the effects of electric shock on the central nervous system. A total of 286 rats was employed in the investigation. These were shocked at 110, 220, 500, and 1000 volts on both alternating- and continuous-current circuits for varying lengths of time. In each series the duration of the shock was increased until it was found impossible to resuscitate the rats. When possible, the rats were resuscitated by means of artificial respiration and kept alive for about a week. Then they were killed by an overdose of ether and an autopsy was immediately made. The rats reacted in entirely different manner on the two types of circuit; at the lower voltages the alternating current was deadlier than the continuous, but at the high voltage, the opposite was found to be the case. In many instances the rats were paralyzed by the application of the current and at autopsy in the majority of these animals gross hemorrhages were found in the spinal cord. All of the deaths that occurred as a result of the shock were caused by respiratory failure, which usually could be traced to an injury of the central nervous system. In some cases the electric current produced peculiar effects upon the rats."
"This paper presents a method of calculating polyphase induction motor performance which eliminates a large amount of detail work without making use of approximations which sacrifice accuracy. In any rigorous system for calculating induction motor performance, the determination of the relation between input and current values makes the greater part of the work. By the procedure here presented, the relation of watts to amperes for all cases likely to be encountered in ordinary design work may be accurately calculated once for all and recorded in a set of curves. When making practical calculations tedious detail work may be eliminated by taking the necessary values from the curves, in much the same way that sines are taken from sine tables. The calculation begins with the torque, from which the corresponding secondary input is obtained by a simple formula. Then, by reference to the appropriate curves and a few simple slide rule operations, the primary and secondary currents are determined. With the secondary input and the current values known, the completion of the calculation requires nothing more than a few operations of simple arithmetic. The entire process for one load point may be completed in from five to seven minutes."
"Lighting one room with a 100-watt incandescent lamp for 300 hours, which is about the average burning time of a lamp a year, costs $2.40 or less. Lighting another room of the same size, the same length of time and with the same brightness, using the original lamps made by Thomas A. Edison 50 years ago, would now cost more than $20.00. At then existing rates for electric service the cost would have been much greater."
"Theory and experimental data are given on the properties of discharges confined to small holes, such as the pores of a naturally porous material. The characteristics of these discharges are such that they are well suited for utilization in a valve type lightning arrester."
"This paper is the fifth of a series which the authors' have presented on the subject of synchronous machines. Part I was an extension of the fundamental theory: Part II, a treatment of torque-angle characteristics under steady-stale conditions; Part III, a study of torque-angle characteristics under transient conditions; and Part IV, an analysis of single-phase short-circuits. In the present paper equations for the currents in the armature phases and field under three-phase short-circuit are developed. The analysis is divided into three parts: The first covers the case of short-circuit at no-load when the resistance is negligible in determining the magnitude of the current although it must naturally be considered in finding the decrement factors: the second considers the same case where the resistance does effect the magnitude of the current; the third covers the case of short-circuit under load when resistance is negligible as in the first case. The effect of the nature of the load, — i. e., whether the power factor is lagging or leading, — is studied and some interesting results are brought out. It is shown that short circuits under load may give less current than at no-load; and it is further developed that under certain practical operating conditions, it is even possible to obtain substantially no fundamental current. The paper is illustrated with comparisons of calculated curves and oscillograms showing the actual currents obtained in test. Some of the interesting points concerning the nature of the short-circuit currents and the manner in which they are influenced by the design of the machine are mentioned in the discussion of results."
"Too much cannot be said in favor of shaded lighting. Comparing shaded light with the bare lamp glare there is everything in favor of the shaded fixture. Soft light is always desirable. Its possibilities for decoration and its soothing effect on its surrounding contrast sharply against the undressed balls of flame which blind the eye and fray the nerves."
"One of the most important and sometimes most involved, problems brought about by the many interconnections of electrical systems, is a means of accurate and flexible regulation of power flow. The adjustment of voltage and the control of wattless current by means of tap-changing-under-load equipment has become quite extensive. The regulation of power flow by means of phase-angle control has been put into practise on a limited scale. One means of accomplishing this which has been used in a few cases and which is being considered on a larger scale is the adaptation of tap-changing-under-load equipment with properly connected static transformers. The purpose of this paper is to discuss briefly the connections employed and the equipment used in connection with static transformers for the purpose of voltage and phase-angle control."
"Certain theories of the breakdown of gases are reviewed. Their limitations or correctness in the light of recent data on the breakdown of large gaps with surge voltages are considered. The work of various investigators on the time lag of breakdown also is discussed briefly. It is shown that comparisons are made difficult and that large discrepancies, particularly at the shorter time lags, may result from variations in the definitions of time lag and breakdown time. The existence of ionization or streamer currents of high magnitude previous to the final breakdown is established and a number of volt — time and ampere — time oscillograms of flashovers on various types of insultation with the effect of these streamer currents in attenuating a traveling chopped wave are shown and discussed."
"The successful operation of an air transportation system depends in no small degree on the communication facilities at its command. Rapid and dependable communication between transport planes in flight and the ground is essential. Two-way radio telephony provides this necessary plane-to-ground contact. The design of a radio telephone system for this service requires quantitative knowledge of the transmission conditions encountered in plane-to-ground communication. An experimental investigation of these conditions over the available frequency range has been carried out and the results are described. A complete aircraft radio telephone system designed for the use of air transport lines and an airplane radio receiver designed for reception of government radio aids to air navigation are also described."

"Edward Bennett, Chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering of the University of Wisconsin, and Vice-President of the Institute during 1924–1926, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 26, 1876. After graduating in Electrical Engineering in 1897 with the degree of E. E. from the Western University of Pennsylvania, (now the University of Pittsburgh) — he served an apprenticeship of a year and a half in the machine shops of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company — a period of bench and machine work in the many departments of the Westinghouse factory. From January to September 1899 he was engaged in research work on lightning arresters; chancing one day to observe the subdivision of a spark which occurred when the electric discharge took place across a short gap between kaolin-graphite electrodes of considerable resistivity, he invented and produced the first multi-path lightning arresters which were placed on 600-volt railway systems and the 40,000-volt system of the Telluride Power Company, and also formed a nucleus for later developments of the Westinghouse Company."

"Following a custom established a number of years ago, all the work coming under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Protective Devices has been divided among subcommittees, accounts of whose activities are presented as part of this report and as evidence of what has been accomplished during the year. These subcommittees, with their chairmen, are as follows:"
"Your Committee on Electric Welding hereby reports the following activities and developments in its field of activity for the fiscal year May 1,1929 to May 1,1930."
"This Committee's chief activities during the present term have been devoted to an extensive review and revision of Standards No. 45. Having been advised that the stock on hand was practically exhausted, the committee had its choice of reissuing Standards No. 45 in its present form, or of revising the same to incorporate the latest developments and expansion in the marine practise. In view of the fact that Standards No. 45 is now nationally recognized by naval architects, marine engineers, shipbuilders, and ship owners, as the American Standard governing electrical installations on shipboard, and owing to many desired revisions and additions, the committee decided to review all sections of the rules and bring them up to date."
"In accordance with established precedence, your Committee on Automatic Stations submits a review of the past year's development and application of automatic stations."
"The major work of this committee during the past year devolved upon its subcommittee on interconnection, composed of F. C. Hanker, Chairman, and affiliates, several of whom were selected outside of committee personnel to secure broad contact with current problems in the subject and to serve as liaison members on associated engineering committees handling related subjects. Recognition of the technical import of interconnection was initially made by the Power Generation Committee in a symposium of papers presented at the midwinter convention in 1928, when the subject was treated chiefly from a regional aspect. Experience throughout 1928 and 1929 focused attention upon several problems of the mechanics of operating interconnections, and the subcommittee appointed in 1929 was enabled to obtain for a symposium at the January, 1930, Convention papers on two operating topics which have been investigated with definite results. The other three papers sponsored for the Winter Convention by the subcommittee were just as pertinent, but covered rather the principles of successful service to separate and contiguous load areas in typical metropolitan districts by relating the fundamental plans upon which the electric systems in Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia have been developed. These three papers, together with companion papers describing the method of power supply recently adopted in New York City which had been presented under the auspices of the Power Transmission and Distribution Committee at the 1929 Summer Convention, form an excellent compilation of the status of interconnection of power generation sources in large city electric systems. The papers included in the 1930 Interconnection Symposium were:"
"Your Committee on General Power Applications has continued the method of keeping in touch with developments and suggestions for papers as outlined in the report last year."
"This paper presents the impressions of a European trip made during the summer of the year 1929 and gives a comparative study of the conditions of European developments in so far as they are either of a particular interest or different from the conditions in the United States. The present day turbine design with particular reference to the development of Propeller and Kaplan turbines is discussed. The more interesting low-head developments, the international interconnection system in the region of the upper Rhine, as well as the extensive use of pumping schemes, are briefly described and illustrated. The tendencies in power house design and the energy destroying problems are mentioned. Laboratory work, its influence on the European developments and the high standing of the low-head developments are stressed. A short comparison between the concrete work as done in Europe and in the United States is made."
"The rapid growth of the telephone cable network in this country has made it desirable to develop a system whereby this network may be utilized to transmit programs for broadcasting stations over distances upwards of 2000 mi. Such a system has recently been developed and given a trial with very satisfactory results on a looped-back circuit 2200 mi. long. It transmits ranges of frequency and volume somewhat in excess of those now handled by the open-wire circuits which are used for program work, and also in excess of those handled by present-day radio broadcasting systems when no long distance lines are involved. The paper deals first with the transmission requirements of broadcasting systems and then gives a description of this new cable system."
"A knowledge of the wave forms of voltages and currents is often of great value to experimental work or in the analysis of the characteristics of electrical circuits and apparatus. This paper describes a portable oscillograph whereby the wave shapes and phase relations of voltages and currents can be observed and photographed almost as easily as their effective values can be measured with the ordinary portable instruments. Because of its simplicity of operation, and because the wave shapes can be observed simultaneously by a large group of persons the instrument is of particular value to scientific and engineering schools."
"With large internal combustion power plants in transportion service the use of electric transmission is almost a necessity. Furthermore, the interposition of the electric transmission provides a method of obtaining what is the equivalent of a wide change in gear ratio, as well as a cushioning of the characteristic power impulses of the internal combustion engine. In adapting the internal combustion engine to this character of service there has been a number of problems, such as fitting the generator to the engine curve, the question of hand or automatic control, field control arrangements, single vs. multiple motor drive, and arrangement and operation of auxiliaries. The use of the combination generator-battery power plant has recently received considerable attention. This application employs a battery operating in parallel with the engine generator power plant, capable of supplementing the power of the engine for short periods. The characteristics of the engine used in transportation service must be well adapted to the duty required. These characteristics vary somewhat with the size of the unit and the control of the engine throttle is usually adapted to the particular problem in hand. In this paper, the principal problems connected with the operation and design of complete engine generator units are discussed in detail and many typical schemes of connection are diagrammatically shown. No attempt is made to discuss the question of multiple power plant operation, although this would mean simply the addition of the necessary cross connections to operate the two power plants in parallel; unless, as is sometimes the case, the several power plants are operating independent of each other, each engine generator furnishing power to Us own motors. In general, there is given a fairly complete summary of the operation and design of this equipment as now used in American railway practise."
"The paper is intended to give a thorough explanation of step-by-step calculations of the synchronous rotor oscillations and other transients which occur in electrical power systems when faults or other sudden changes take place. It is divided essentially into two parts. In Part I a descriptive illustration of the phenomena is given in order that the reader may visualize the conditions. In Part II general formulas are developed for calculations where any number of salient or non-salient pole machines are operating at various points on an impedance network. In Appendix I (complete paper) a special and simplified example is set up and analyzed. In Appendixes II and III the numerical calculations of the swing curve for the special example in Appendix I are given, and a brief discussion is offered on the accuracy of this step-by-step method of calculation."
"This paper describes some of the results of the work of the Joint Development and Research Subcommittee of the National Electric Light Association and Bell Telephone System on the mutual impedances of ground return circuits. The first part of the paper deals with some experiments which were performed to establish an experimental background for the testing of theoretical ideas. Different theories, one involving an “equivalent ground-plane,” a second, a d-c. distribution in the earth, and a third, an a-c. distribution in the earth, are discussed in the light of the experimental results. While none of these is adequate to explain all the observed phenomena, each has a field in which it can be made useful The second part of the paper is devoted to a description of practical means for predetermining the mutual impedances of power and telephone lines. This involves an experimental determination of a curve of mutual impedance as a function of separation in the region of the proposed exposure and the calculation of the over-all mutual impedance between the proposed lines from this curve and the dimensions of the exposure. The results of trials of this method in two locations are given indicating that it should be of sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes."
"Announcement has recently been made of a portable electro-cardiograph, an instrument for recording on photograph film the electric currents that accompany heart action."
"This paper, prepared with the cooperation of the members of the Insulator and Lightning Subcommittee, points out the present need for rationalizing transmission system strength on the basis of lightning voltage. The higher grade of service demanded of transmission systems today requires fewer interruptions. It is pointed out that for a four-year period the line interruptions due to lightning on an extensive 132-kv. network average 75 per cent of all line outages. Apparatus failures due to lightning, while not numerically great, can be materially reduced if the system insulation is coordinated on the lightning basis. Over-insulation of lines has been tried in some cases, particularly on wood pole lines, with varying degrees of success in reducing line outages. But this method of attacking the lightning problem does not consider the protection of station equipment where the most costly apparatus is subject to damage, and where apparatus damage may result in long service outage. It is pointed out that additional knowledge is necessary on lightning strengths of insulation, and apparatus to rationalize system voltage strengths on a lightning basis. This information is gradually being secured by various groups working on the problem. To aid in solving the lightning problem, it is proposed that a set of standard lest waves be adopted, by which insulation and apparatus if possible may be tested. With this knowledge of the lightning insulation strength of apparatus, it will be possible to design transmission systems more intelligently on a lightning basis so far as insulation is concerned, in addition to the present 60-cycle basis. On the basis of field data secured last year on wave-shapes of natural lightning, three standard test waves are proposed, having voltage — time characteristics similar to those actually observed. It is pointed out that lightning voltage should be designated in units peculiar to lightning and not in terms of 60-cycle voltage values."
"In the application of various types of locomotives to switching service, it is at times quite desirable to have data concerning the energy requirements involved. A convenient figure for expressing such requirements in relation to work done is watthours per ton-mile. The determination of such a figure involves certain difficulties peculiar to switching service, in that trailing loads and distances moved are continually varying. The electrified Oak Point Yard of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad in New York City offered an excellent opportunity for determining figures of watthours per ton-mile for different kinds of switching. Accordingly, two electric locomotives were equipped with the necessary instruments, and a total of 39 1/6 hr. of operation was observed and recorded. The paper describes in some detail the entire procedure of the tests and lists in tabulated form the data obtained. Basic figures necessary for calculating watthours per ton-mile, it was found, could be expanded to give a much broader scope to the results, so that many interesting data became available. Incidentally, the data will permit of even further expansion where certain special figures or factors are desired. Although electric locomotives of different types were used, the results set forth in the paper should be considered without regard to either type. It is hoped that data concerning switching operations on other railroads may become available."
"The results of theoretical and oscillographic study of transient voltage phenomena in shell type and core type transformers with neutral isolated from ground, and also with neutral grounded through impedances of different characteristics, are briefly described. In the case of isolated neutral, the majority of lightning traveling waves cause the potential of the entire winding, including neutral, to rise above ground to a value at least equal to the applied voltage. In the case of switching surges, the voltage of the neutral as well as of the rest of the winding is apt to rise to a value considerably in excess of the applied voltage. In the case of transformers excited with damped oscillations similar to switching surges, oscillographic records of both shell and core type transformers indicate internal voltages to ground approximately four times the applied. Grounding of a transformer through resistance, inductance, or capacitance does not reduce the above internal transient voltages, unless a certain relation is established between these constants, the constants of the transformer circuit, and the wave shape of the line surge. If the proper relation of these constants is established, then internal transient voltages are reduced practically to those of a solidly grounded transformer. A grounding device called an “impedor,” can be designed to have impedance at operating frequency equal to any desired value and to act at transient voltage frequencies as if its impedance were practically zero. This device can be designed for each transformer bank or for a number of banks in parallel. If grounded through a suitable impedor a non-resonating transformer retains its uniform transient voltage distribution. During the last year and a half, nearly 800,000 kv-a. of transformers of non-resonating type, have been built so that they can be operated with impedor in the neutral."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a logical basis for the insulation of transmission lines and substations using as a basis the characteristics of traveling waves produced by lightning discharges. The method presented was formulated from the data obtained from the cathode ray oscillograms of actual line surges and upon the laboratory work in which the impulse flashover characteristics of insulating structures was determined. The breakdown volt — time characteristics of various forms of insulation are presented. Using these curves of various forms of gaps in the known characteristics of traveling waves, insulation of the transmission line at various distances from the gap is determined so that flashover will be unlikely to occur at these points. A similar method of analysis is made upon substations and lines protected by lightning arresters, but with the known characteristics of lightning arresters, the insulation on the line up to points 1000 to 5000 ft. away can be apportioned so that the lightning arrester will take the discharge, preventing the flashover of insulation. The system set forth in the paper enables the transmission engineer to design the line and substation in an economical manner and obtain adequate protection for all points desired."
"The usual methods of relaying are becoming inadequate for tie line application. The need for limiting the duration of faults on lines of major importance is unquestioned. The possibility of maintaining stability by quicker operation of protective equipment is well recognized. These considerations have resulted in the development of the high-speed relays and oil circuit breakers as steps in the over-all reduction of short-circuit duration."
"Ever since the initial demonstration of television both by wire and by radio at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1927, experimental work has been steadily pursued in order to learn the problems and possibilities of this newest branch of electrical communication. The latest development to be demonstrated is that of twoway television as an adjunct to the telephone. As a result of our development work, there is now set up an experimental and demonstration system between the headquarters building of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company at 195 Broadway and the building of the Bell Telephone Laboratories at 463 West Street, New York City, two miles away. This system makes it possible the experiment with a method of communication in which the parties engaged not only speak with each other but at the same time see each other. Study of this system will serve to give information on the importance of the addition of sight to sound in communication and will give valuable experience in handling the technical problems involved."
"Consideration of generated voltages and switching surges might logically be taken as the basis for determining the minimum amounts of insulation required for lines and stations. Lightning, when it is encountered, affects service primarily through its influence on lines. The lightning insulation strengths which may be suitable for the lines may bear little or no relation to the operating voltage or the basic insulation strengths found satisfactory at the stations. In order that service will be affected a minimum by the excessive lightning voltages which may be propagated to, or originate at the stations, it is desirable that they be discharged external to the station and Us apparatus. To accomplish this four lightning insulation levels are proposed; the basic or lowest level (determined by consideration of generated and switching surge voltages) being established by the line insulation or spillway gaps at the line entrances; the buses and connections constituting the next higher level; apparatus bushings next; and finally the apparatus internals. More complete data on the nature of transient voltages and the performance of insulation with these voltages applied, are required before insulation can be coordinated with assurance. During the interim period however it should be possible to accomplish substantial improvement to service by applying to specific cases as they arise, the knowledge and data already available and being gathered. Since the entire project is distinctly in the development and research stage, the authors believe more progress should be accomplished before recognized standardization can be undertaken to advantage of such features as test waves, characteristics of insulation and insulation levels for lines, stations and apparatus."

"Frank William Peek, Jr. joined the Institute as an Associate in 1907. He has always taken an active part in Institute affairs and in 1925 was transferred to the grade of Fellow. As Chief Engineer of the Transformer Engineering Department of the General Electric Company at Pittsfield, Mass., and in view of the fact that he is a native of California, (born at Mokelumne Hill and graduated from Leland Stanford University in 1905) it is fitting that he should have made his greatest contributions to science in the discovery or laws relating to corona as applied to transmission lines. It was in California, from the Bay Counties plant equipped with Stanley apparatus, that power was first, in the early nineties, transmitted at 60,000 volts over a distance of 140 miles; more recently 220,000-volt lines were placed in service in California. In truth, Mr. Peek's first electrical work was done at the Electra plant of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, California, during college vacations."
"This paper considers the application of centralized control of system operation of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in New Jersey. A brief history of events leading to the installation of supervisory system operation is given, with a detailed description of the apparatus and the methods used to carry out the indications, together with a statement as to what is being accomplished in improving the service."
"This paper describes an instrument which was developed to make graphic records of generator revolutions and time, as the generator slows down under the action of its losses during retardation tests. The construction of speed — time curves from the records thus obtained is outlined. The principle of numerical differentiation is discussed and its application to the determination of the slope of the speed — time curve is pointed out. A complete example illustrating the application of this principle is included in the unabridged paper."
"This paper gives the operating experience of some thousand miles of 132-kv. transmission lines analyzed from the lightning point of view. The lightning experience during three years operation of the system is compared. In addition, the effect of ground wires, grading shields, and tower footing ground resistances is discussed from data secured under operating conditions. The comparative reliability of single- and two-circuit lines is analyzed from the data recorded. Cases of damage to insulator strings, hardware, etc., are tabulated and discussed from the point of the severity of the damage and the location on the phase wires. Yearly averages of lightning outages per 100 mi. of line per year are given for the different lines and from these figures comparisons made for the different types of line construction. A three year record is given of the percentage of lightning outages on the 1000-mi. network."
"This paper enumerates the voltage irregularities which may occur in d-c. generators. It gives a description of these irregularities, the cause of their occurrence, the magnitude of their values, and their effects on radio circuits; it also states the problem encountered in their measurement. A method is described for the measurement of these voltage irregularities by the use of an oscillograph, a blocking condenser, and a current transformer. A number of oscillograph records illustrative of the voltage irregularities existent in various d-c. generators is shown, and an analysis of the wave form made for each component of slow and fast ripple. These records were taken under various electrical and mechanical conditions of the generators. Comparisons between these records are made. There are conclusions drawn as to features desirable in d-c. generators."
"The object of this paper is to present the results of an investigation to determine the effect of resistors shunting current limiting reactors, on the impulse behavior of the typical system employing them. The typical system is reduced, without loss of essential generality, to a comparatively simple analytic network; and the impulse behavior of this network is then calculated mathematically. These calculations are adequately supported by test results with impulse generator and cathode ray oscillograph, both in the field and in the laboratory, and accurate agreement established. Methods are developed and illustrated for taking into account incident waves, such as those due to lightning, of arbitrary shape. Under the most unfavorable condition of wave shape and circuit conditions, voltages approaching four times that of the incident wave may be built up at the bus by reflections and oscillations. In general, through the use of a shunting resistor, of proper value, three beneficial results are obtained: (a) Oscillations are completely eliminated, thereby limiting the maximum voltage which can occur on the bus to never more than twice that of the incident wave. (b) The initial rise in voltage on the line side of the reactor, due to positive reflections, is reduced and can be held down to the final value corresponding to the tail of an infinite rectangular incident wave. (c) The internal oscillations in the reactor itself can be eliminated, and the voltage distribution improved. The extent to which these improvements can be realized, under a wide range of possible operating conditions, is discussed and illustrated in this paper. With some combinations, the improvements are very great, while for others, there is no appreciable gain. The criterion for utilization of shunt resistors is, — will the elimination of oscillations and the reduction of positive reflections, under the most unfavorable possible operating condition which can be experienced on a given system, be worth the cost?"
"Not only is every motor car which passes through the Holland Tunnels counted electrically, but a new application of the same electric eye, or photo-electric cell, has now been installed to give warning of dangerous exhaust gases from automobiles."
"In the production of steel, the use of electrical energy is growing rapidly. This paper outlines the present operating conditions in the Monongahela Valley System of the Carnegie Steel Company. The use of automatic switching for certain portions of this power supply has proved both economical and satisfactory."
"The factors having influence on insulation design of transmission line and station are briefly reviewed, and it is pointed out that the progress of the art does not yet allow of close design of the insulation structure for insulation strength. The prominent part played by the lightning arrester is stressed, and the fact that it has a marked effect on the coordination of station insulation. Examples of a typical 110-kv. station where no coordination was made, and of a 220-kv. station where a deliberate coordination was attempted, are given, as well as the experience obtained with each."
"For purposes of study, the available energy at the cathode of the iron arc for welding in air, and the disbursement of this available energy to the cathode processes, are set up in balance-sheet form. The energy as heat at the cathode includes that from (1) ionic bombardment, (2) ohmic resistance of cathode tip, (3) radiation from the anode, and (4) combustion. Since the division of total arc energy between anode and cathode is nearly an equal one, the sum of the first three should approximate one-half of the total energy input to the arc. Heat Disbursement at Cathode: The principal consumption of heat at the cathode is by (5) melting of cathode, (6) evaporation of atoms at cathode, (7) evaporation of electrons at cathode, (8) dissociation of arc vapors, (9) radiation to anode and to air. Of the total heat disbursed by the arc more than half is consumed, as shown by measurement, by the melting of the electrode. The heat consumption for this melting is greater than the calculated value of total heat received at the cathode. The latter value is therefore incorrect and needs to be revised, using higher values of Vc or φ + or both. On the other hand, the calculated total energy consumption at the cathode corresponds closely to one-half the measured total electrical input to the arc and is therefore approximately correct."
"The ability of systems to withstand shocks, such as faults or switching operations, is much greater for small operating angles. The present paper has to do with system stability for small oscillations as contrasted with the more usual concept of stability as being its ability to withstand shocks. The analysis shows that synchronous machines without amortisseur windings and with no resistance in the armature are inherently stable for small oscillations in prime mover input or load output. With resistance in the armature, stability for such conditions is dependent upon load. A new proof is given for the relation previously derived by Nickle and Pierce which states that the limiting angle at which a machine becomes stable is $\\tan^{1} {r \\over x_{q}}$. Arguments are presented which show that any standard type of damper which may have been installed in generators for other incidental reasons possesses the property of preventing spontaneous hunting except for the most abnormal conditions met in practise."
"This paper describes the conditions leading up to the development of the two-wire supervisory control system. It enumerates the outstanding requirements of supervisory control systems in general and indicates a number of the advantages of the two-wire system. It provides a brief description of the operation of the system."
"In spite of the great improvements which the cathode-ray oscillograph for high-vacuum photography has undergone in the last few years, the problem of photography in free air is most important on account of the great simplifications for general construction and for taking of photographs. An available method for taking photographs outside the vacuum, was found to be the employment of an electron permeable window (Lenard window) of the size of the oscillogram to be made. Ordinary aluminum or cellon foil of approximately 7 or 16 μ, thickness respectively may be used if the common exciting voltages of 66–75 kv. are employed. With such foils, all results are to obtain which hitherto have been feasible only with high-vacuum photography. According to this method, oscillograms in free air were taken which attained recording speeds up to 5000 km. per sec, using an exciting voltage of 75 kv. only. With this recording speed, details in the oscillograms of the duration of one milliardth of a second may be dissolved. As compared with the high-vacuum photography hitherto exclusively used for recording quickest phenomena, the Lenard window oscillograph allows taking photographs in a considerably shorter time with the advantages of the simpler construction and manipulation."
"The new construction described is intended to secure a sturdy and simple tower, not sensitive to irregularities in footing conditions; it is generally applicable where a horizontal arrangement of conductors is feasible. The tower consists of an articulated overhead transverse bridge carrying the conductors and hinged at the tops of the footings. Two or three intermediate towers are used between stabilizer towers. Transverse strength is secured by crossed internal ties and longitudinal stresses are taken up in the stabilizer towers by heavy guys and in the intermediate towers by the ground wires and conductors which transmit these stresses to the stabilizer towers. The wide base structure thus secured has substantially no resultant uplift on the footings, offering a very large saving in foundation costs. This saving, together with the lessening of material and erecting costs, and the great ease with which it is adapted to varying ground conditions, makes this a very economical type of tower."
"The Cooperative Idea has been the motivating spirit in the various attempts to bring together the educational and industrial elements in engineering. The outstanding milestones of progress in this undertaking are the “Sandwich System” of Scotland, the establishment of shops in schools, the rise of educational opportunities in industrial concerns, the report of Sir William White's committee of practising engineers and educators in England, and finally, the conception and inception of the cooperative courses at the University of Cincinnati and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These courses are taken as examples of two types of cooperative course called respectively the “Cincinnati Plan” and the “M. I. T. Plan.” Each of these possesses a structure and a set of operating principles determined by the purpose for which it was instituted and the conditions under which it is carried out. The operating principles of the M. I. T. Plan are discussed in detail in this paper. The graduates of both these plans are demonstrating that the results sought are being accomplished."
"This paper develops in as simple a manner as possible the necessity for the concept of “differential leakage” where transformer action takes place between two unequally distributed windings and explains the character of differential leakage. The value to be used for the transformer ratio in the case of such unequally distributed windings is also given. All considerations are based on the conventional stepped wave field forms, and the mathematics used involve only the simplest linear equations. While in nature, the paper is mainly intended to be expository a general indication is given at the end as to how differential leakage and transformer ratios can be calculated for both single-phase and polyphase arrangements."
"The vacuum tube is rapidly coming out of the category of signaling devices, and is developing on to a scale where it is capable of handling quantities of power which make it a real tool for the electrical engineer. With tubes now being built with ratings of from 100 to 200 kilowatts, one may see that the electronic era of power equipment is indeed opening up."
"When, in an attempt to escape the dominance of the elements, the play first moved under a roof, it was forced to accept the limitations of artificial illumination. Originally, of course, only visibility was demanded, and the flambeaux and brazier torches then available were adequate. The introduction of gas (Lyceum Theater, London, 1803) greatly simplified stage lighting, since it made possible a central control, permitting an operator, by means of valves at one point, to control all of the lights on the stage. The introduction of the incandescent electric lamp was responsible for great technical advance in the art of stage lighting, mainly because of the methods evolved for controlling intensity and for coordinating the action of many lights."
"TORONTO is spread out along the shores of Lake Ontario, which is a link in the great fresh-water chain extending from the Atlantic to the heart of the continent; thus it offers much of interest in connection with inland navigation as well as aquatic sports of all kinds. The city is located within convenient traveling distance of the most densely populated portions of the United States, and many members who have not hitherto visited Toronto will find there much of unusual interest. An important technical program, delightful entertainment and ample facilities for sports, together with an opportunity to renew old acquaintanceships, are offered to those who attend the 1930 Summer Convention, which will be held, with headquarters in the Royal York Hotel at Toronto, Canada, June 23–27."

"Bryon C. Wolverton, born in Portland, Maine, April 4, 1863, died at Clifton Springs, New York, April 22, 1930. He joined the Institute as an Associate in 1890 and in 1895 was transferred to the Member's grade. His general education was acquired at Starkey Seminary and his technical knowledge, under private tutelage in the laboratory. He was first employed as Telegraph Operator by the N. C. Railroad and in 1884 was appointed Electrician of the New York & Pennsylvania Telegraph and Telephone Company, for which he had done work prior to that date. This position required of him the design and construction, as well as the installation, of all apparatus and appliances used by the company, with charge of the company's shops, all materials used, and general supervision of all technical work. His work also included the making of estimates construction of apparatus, and the installation and care of all switchboards in Central Offices; in fact everything that appertained to equipment used by the company in the pursuit of business. This involved not only the electrical side of operation, but the mechanical as well. Most of his professional work, however, was devoted to the field of telephony, and his position at the time of his death was Chief Engineer of the Friendship Telephone Company, New York, N. Y., the interests of which he has served for many years. He had been made a Member for Life of the Institute."

"On the evening of Friday, May 23, the New York Section held its final meeting for the year 1929–30. The meeting, held in the Engineering Auditorium was devoted to the subject “Policing Our Great City.” Police Department officials described the training and coordinating of the work of the 19,000 men composing the force, including the detective squads, the marine and flying squads, the Statistical Department, the Bureau of Missing Persons, etc. Every talk proved intensely interesting to the 450 attending members. The speakers were, as follows: Police Commissioner Edward P. Mulrooney, on “The Police Department;” Inspector Joseph J. Donovan on “Some Unique Department Statistics;” Captain J. H. Ayres on “Missing Persons;” Lieutenant F. E. Zwirz on “Fingerprints and Their Use;” Sergeant H. F. Butts on “Ballistics.” Motion pictures of the police parade and review were shown as well as interesting slides illustrating points in some of the talks."

"A joint meeting of the Southern Virginia Section of the Institute and the Virginia Sections of the A. S. C. E., A. S. M. E., and American Chemical Society was held at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute Branch, Friday and Saturday, April 25 and 26, 1930. The registration at the meeting was 118."
"The last meeting of the 1929–30 season of the Chicago Section was a dinner-smoker held May 14, in the Bal Tabarin of the Hotel Sherman in Chicago. The attendance was over 400 and not one of those present expressed himself as dissatisfied with the meeting. A striking feature was the small part which professional entertainment played in the program. It was felt that the members of the section would be brought closer together and made better acquainted with each other if reliance were placed upon the members themselves for the major part of the entertainment. Accordingly a number of representative groups in the Section were requested to prepare and present such acts as talent was available for. The result was extraordinarily successful. It contributed no little to the success of the party to have the entertainment originate in the Section. The Commonwealth Edison Company members put on an elaborate sketch. Members associated with the General Electric Company put on another; the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois furnished a magician from among their employees. The Illinois Bell Telephone Company produced a telephone operator who could sing as well as say “The line is busy,” and who directed a large chorus of men from that organization. Lewis and Armour Institutes which furnish a large number of the Student Members of the Section each contributed vaudeville acts of professional caliber. The season just concluded has been an extraordinarily successful one for the Chicago Section from all points of view and the dinner-smoker proved itself to be a highly enjoyable and very fitting wind-up to the season's activities."

The entire installation will cost nearly $200,000, and besides the speakers in the guest rooms there will be thirty-nine large horn speakers concealed in the walls or ceilings of the fifteen public rooms. The largest power amplifier ever designed, consisting of twentyone separate panels, larger than any similar broadcasting station equipment in the country, will be used to intensify programs received over the radio or the addresses or music picked up from a function held within the hotel. More than 1,000,000 feet of wire, in the form of strands in metal shielding, will convey the programs from the amplifier to each of the rooms Telegraph & Telephone Age. (Sept. 1930)"
"This paper describes the methods of calculating mechanical performance of a typical rotary type oil circuit breaker, operated by a spring-actuated motor control. For a given spring characteristic, the motion of the breaker is predicted, and time required to reach any position, and the speed at that position, calculated. General formulas are set up. A mechanical test is performed on a specific breaker and a comparison made between calculated and tested results."
"Improvements in steam power generation, and economic changes in the fuel supply, have caused increasing interest in steam power on the Pacific Coast. After a brief history of the development of steam power on the system of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the author discusses some of the fundamental factors entering into the problem of providing additional steam plant capacity for this company in accord with the changed economic conditions. The author describes recent work completed and under construction and gives some of the economic results obtained and expected."
"Research investigations conducted by engineers as well as physicists during the last few years have resulted in notable improvements in the mercury arc rectifier, in particular with reference to backfire protection and voltage regulation as well as improved manufacturing methods. These improvements have made it possible to build rectifiers of very large current capacities as well as for very high voltages. In order to explain the results obtained with the aid of these improvements the basic principle of rectification is briefly reviewed. Methods of testing rectifiers have also been improved upon and new ones developed. Standard parts are now used for different rectifiers up to the largest capacities. An account is given of notable recent rectifier installations for city subway service, for a portable street-railway substation, radio transmission, electrolytic zinc refining, and for Edison systems."
"The question of grounding transformer bank neutrals through different impedances has recently arisen due to the desire to limit system single-phase and two-phase short-circuit currents. It was found that the use of resistance, only, may be undesirable on account of the high voltage at the neutral in limiting the short-circuit current. The use of inductance, only, may result in high voltages within the transformer and at the neutral due to lightning transients, which necessitates the transformer being fully insulated throughout. Methods using parallel paths with the inductance, (these parallel paths being designed primarily to reduce the lightning transients at the neutral), have been studied and found to limit the transients within the transformers to values approximating those for solidly-grounded neutral which permit the grading of the transformer insulation. The method to be selected depends upon the individual case; but generally, the use of the valve type lightning arrester is the simplest to apply."
"THE New York Edison Company and affiliated companies operate two 25-cycle stations aggregating 402,000 kw., four combined 25- and 60-cycle stations aggregating 1,110,000 kw., and two 60-cycle stations aggregating 405,000 kw., a total generating capacity of 1,917,000 kw. with a 1929 peak load of 1,225,200 kw."
"During the past year or so, studies of stability have been made to determine methods of preventing loss of synchronism upon the occurrence of faults. Of the several methods found, the most obvious and effective is the high-speed isolation of the faulty section of the line; and this of course means high-speed relays and high-speed breakers. Investigation so far has indicated that the time required depends upon the type of fault. Since a three-phase short circuit prevents the flow of synchronizing power, it is the most serious type and must be cleared in from six to ten cycles. This demands the use of relays which will operate “instantaneously.” Recent suggestions have been numerous, and these are discussed, this discussion covering relays operating at normal frequency and those which have been operated or suggested for higher superimposed frequencies. While there is a number of difficulties attendant on the design of high-speed relays — these troubles depending on the type and construction of the relay — still high-speed relays may be made to operate on any of the present well-known principles, such as impedance principle, current balance principle, etc. They may employ either a mechanical structure or may make use of thermionic or gas-filled tubes. Attention is given to a mechanical relay of the impedance type operating with a speed of one cycle or less. Some discussion is also given of the reactance type relay with mention of its limitations, particularly that of the extra time required for its initialing element to operate. The effect of resistance at the point of fault (arc resistance) is discussed and the conclusion drawn that, for extremely high-speed operation, it does not interfere with satisfactory relay performance. This is because of the time required for the arc resistance to increase to an appreciable value."
"This paper was written to review and extend the theory of overvoltages due to the arcing grounds because of the increasing tendency to use impedances between the neutral point and the ground, thereby losing the advantage of the solidly grounded neutral. The “third-class conductor” theory of Steinmetz is touched upon very briefly and is considered as not applying to transmission line conditions. The theory when the phenomenon is controlled by normal frequency arc extinction, as presented by Peters and Slepian, is reviewed, and the maximum voltage for this analysis is found to be $3{1\\over 2}$ E, where E is the normal line to neutral voltage. The theory when the phenomenon is controlled by oscillatory frequency arc extinction as originated by Doctor Petersen is given in detail but in a modified and extended form. The maximum voltage for a single-phase circuit when no damping is considered is found to be 6 E. The analysis for the three-phase circuit is newly developed for the case in which there is an impedance between the neutral and ground and the maximum voltage is found to be 7.5 E when the effect of the damping factors and capacitance between lines is neglected. The method of determining the various reductions or damping factors is outlined. The effect of a neutral grounding resistor is discussed and it is pointed out that a surprisingly high value of resistance can be used without incurring the possibility of dangerous overvoltages. It is shown that the use of reactance is more liable to result in overvoltages than resistance but that relatively large values of reactance can be used in conjunction with resistance. The Petersen Coil is usually considered as causing the arc to go out by giving a balance of lagging and leading currents in the arc. It is brought out in this paper that there will be no voltages built up when the Petersen Coil is used, whether or not the arc goes out. The relation of the overvoltages on a non-grounded and an effectively grounded system is outlined, and a criterion for determining whether or not a system is effectively grounded is proposed."
"The Alcoa Power Company, Limited has under construction a large hydroelectric power development at Chute-a-Caron on the Saguenay River which has a flow varying from 35,000 to 225,000 cu. ft. per sec. The site selected was a gorge located in a rocky section of the river. To complete the large masonry dam across this gorge it was necessary to divert the river, at low flow, through a new channel."
"Underground transmission and distribution circuits are being continually extended, and large amounts of new capital invested each year in the conduit and cable systems which this extension requires. More and more frequently the cable engineer is called upon for accurate information as to the maximum loads that may safely be impressed on underground cables without exceeding the temperature limits recognized in present day practise. The importance of the study of cable temperatures has long been recognized, and much excellent material has been published concerning its several phases. In particular, the copper temperature rise of loaded cables above the surrounding air has been fully analyzed. Less thorough treatment, however, has been given the determination of the temperatures existing in loaded duct structures, and to the behavior of cables carrying cyclic loads. It is the purpose of this paper to present a comprehensive survey of the whole problem of cable temperatures by consolidating information on cable temperature characteristics with the equally important problem of the characteristics of duct structure when the cable circuits are subjected to the cyclic loads usually found in practise. The information herein presented on the subject of duct bank temperatures is the result of an investigation in the metropolitan district of New York, carried on for several years under widely varying conditions. The constants given for certain types of duct structures may not be universally applicable to other localities, but it is believed that the method of attack will be helpful to other engineers in analyzing test data obtained upon their systems and in separating the various factors involved."
"An experimental investigation of the influence of polarity on high-voltage discharges is reported in this paper. Particular attention is given to those discharges used in high-voltage measurements. A theory of the formation of Lichtenberg figures is given together with experimental evidence upon which it is based. A polarity indicator utilizing visual Lichtenberg figures is described. Results of 60-cycle and impulse tests on various types of gaps are given. It is shown that polarity has a distinct effect upon the sparking voltages of all types of gaps. Impulse measurements with grounded sphere-gaps are shown to be subject to serious error unless the polarity effects are taken into consideration. An explanation of the influence of polarity on spark-over is proposed."

"It is the object of this paper to discuss the relative effects of different forms of voltage transients on insulators, gaps, and insulation; to show how the effects and breakdown voltages of various types of transients are related; and to compare natural lightning waves with those used in the laboratory. Such knowledge is necessary in making a comparison of insulators, insulation, and in coordination. The law of impulse sparkover has been determined and formulas have been developed to predetermine time lag and breakdown voltage for the various types of transients."

"Designed to provide a simple and convenient means for determining the thermal conductivity of electrical insulating materials, as well as for use in testing laboratories which are now specially equipped for heat transfer work, a new Method of Test for Comparing the Thermal Conductivities of Solid Electrical Insulating Materials has been issued by the American Society for Testing Materials. The method is the thermal analogy of the potentiometer method of comparing electrical resistances. A specimen of unknown conductivity is placed in series with a standard specimen of known conductivity between plates which are maintained at different temperatures. The respective temperature differences across the standard and the test specimens when a steady state of heat flow is attained are inversely proportional to their relative conductivities. The conductivity of the standard specimens must, of course, be measured by an absolute method. Sets of thermal conductivity standards covering the usual range of electrical insulating materials may be prepared by incorporating suitable proportions of graphite in rubber. Such sets may be calibrated in laboratories equipped to make absolute measurements of thermal conductivity."

"This paper describes the switching equipment and its arrangement in an outdoor switching center at 132, 66, and 12 kv., in connection with an installation of three-winding transformers, This installation is a junction point on an interconnected system, from which energy is distributed at the lower voltage. The development of the original 12-kv. installation with indoor type of equipment enclosed in metal housings and concrete cells is described and the reasons leading to its extension with metal-clad oil filled gear are discussed. A feature of this metal-clad oil filled installation is that it is laid out on an isolated phase basis with wide separation between phases, which is the first time that this arrangement has been attempted with this type of equipment. Included in the design are complete facilities for grounding and testing of the equipment, which to insure maximum safety in their use are fully interlocked. A brief discussion of costs as compared with indoor installations is also given."
"A new substance known as tungsten-carbide which offers great possibilities for high-speed cutting was described by W. H. McCoy of the General Motors Corporation of the Production Meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers held October 7th and 8th at the Book-Cadillac Hotel, Detroit."
"This paper relates how one operating company has endeavored to protect its lines and transformers from lightning by means of additional insulation, ground wires, and various types of lightning arresters, and reports the results obtained. While some improvement was apparent from each scheme, the most effective protection seems to be derived from ample insulation."
"This paper gives a general description of the Southern California Edison Company's communication system which not only meets the requirements of load dispatching but also serves to bring about close cooperation between the outlying district forces and their directing heads at division headquarters and in the general office. The detail of development and construction by the company of the “serjdetour” arrester is made public for the first time. This piece of equipment has made possible a protective system which not only prevents damage to valuable communication equipment in stations for the extreme case of actual contact between telephone lines and power lines but also preserves continuity of communication service after power system disturbances which create surges of considerable magnitude on inductively exposed telephone lines have taken place. A brief outline is presented of the standardized assemblies of telephone equipment into units which are adaptable to wide variations in requirements by the use of different combinations and quantities of standard units. The communication building, the center of a telephone system, is described, as is also the method of handling traffic through this point. A brief description of the equipment for making initial tests on new lines and maintenance of existing facilities is given."
"Experience has shown that rotating machinery connected directly to overhead lines is more vulnerable to surges than many other types of apparatus. This fact, together with a desire on the part of some to connect important units to the line in this manner, has necessitated a study of the protection problem. Such a study is here described, showing oscillograms taken when steep voltage surges were applied to machine windings measuring internal voltages to ground which are 200 per cent of the voltage allowed by the terminal lightning arrester. A simple traveling wave analysis of these oscillations is developed, which has successfully explained the pecularities of over 400 oscillograms taken under various terminal conditions. Practical methods of eliminating the oscillations with neutral impedance are outlined in the light of the theory developed, and oscillographic evidence supporting their reliability is given. A generalized theory of neutral protection is proposed. The importance of wave-front, surge impedance of incoming line, arrester resistance, and other factors is discussed. Methods for protection of the turn insulation and the insulation to ground of such machines are suggested, showing that the lightning arrester limits only the potential of waves entering the machine and cannot control oscillations which may take place within the machine. The advantages of thyrite as a neutral resistor are pointed out in connection with the short-circuit protection, telephone interference, and lightning protection problems of such machines. In Appendix A, the test circuits and methods used in the laboratory are discussed in relation to actual field conditions."
"This paper describes the problems attending the laying of eight 75-kv. submarine cables across the Delaware River in the vicinity of Wilmington. To insure against injury, the cables were laid in a backfilled trench the depth of which was determined by experiments. By terminating the cable on platforms just inside the pierhead lines it was possible to use a cable of 4050 ft. (maximum length possible for one of the accepted manufacturers to make) as compared with a river width of 5100 ft. To avoid the excessive healing of that portion of the cable out of water at the cable platforms, the steel armor was replaced by one of nonmagnetic material so designed as to avoid corrosion and electrolysis. The problem of laying the limited lengths of cable in the trench with minimum deviation was satisfactorily met with specially developed methods. The construction work was completed in five months, under winter conditions and with river traffic heavy."
"This paper deals mainly with a more general and systematic method than has hitherto been used in handling certain classes of problems involving steady-state transmission calculations in terms of real quantities."
"In addition to the establishment of beacon lights and intermediate landing fields by the Federal Government, additional communication facilities are being provided which will meet the further demands of air transport companies operating under all conditions of weather on Federal airways. These facilities consist of a network of land line services, airways radio stations, and radio range stations along the airways for collecting and broadcasting weather information and for the guidance of aircraft by radio direction. Marker beacons are located at the intersection of the radio range courses to signal the pilot that his receiver-should be adjusted to the frequency of the next radio range. These beacons also serve to give the exact location on the route. The Bureau of Standards and other similar branches of the Government and private concerns are constantly engaged in research and development work. The Federal Radio Commission's aviation plan provides for two-way communications with aircraft by the air transport companies. The aviation plan also provides for a system of communications between airports and aircraft. The services of these companies and airports are coordinated with the facilities provided by the Federal Government."
"In the last eight years voltage regulation on transformers under sustained load has made rapid strides and found very wide application in extended power systems and on industrial loads. Originally it was found economical to equip for load ratio control only very large transformers using apparatus designed for high currents. This paper describes and compares with earlier developments a novel equipment of low-current rating that has been devised especially to control small blocks of power, thereby greatly widening the economic field of application of load ratio control. Particularly are the electromechanical features of this equipment stressed."
"Metal clad gum filled switchgear has recently been developed using well-known standard American types of round tank, oil tight oil circuit breakers. This metal clad gear has important advantages over previous types of open or cell gear in the features of safety, compactness, service, maintenance and installation. Busses, etc., are mounted on micarta and are insulated and sealed in a gum of high dielectric value. The oil circuit breakers are raised to their bus contacts either by means of a common truck or by individual lifting mechanism per compartment. Very compact accessories, such as oil disconnecting switches, potential transformer assemblies, etc., are used. With the high factor of safety provided for the bus, etc., the old standard double-bus scheme is not necessary as a spare bus, though a transfer bus is valuable to permit inspection of any breaker without interruption of service. A description is given of various installations, including the large isolated-phase, outdoor switchgear under construction at Leaside Station, Toronto."
"The drive unit of this system consists of a constant-speed a-c. motor supplemented by an adjustable-speed d-c. machine of much smaller size. Both rotor and frame of the a-c. motor are mounted on bearings. The d-c. machine is mechanically connected to the frame of the a-c. motor so that the d-c. machine may drive or be driven by the frame. The d-c. machine is electrically connected through a motor-generator set of equivalent rating, to the source of a-c. energy. The shaft speed of the a-c. motor is increased above the fixed speed by rotating the frame of the a-c. motor in the same direction as the rotor, and it is decreased by rotating the frame in the opposite direction. The direction of rotation and speed are governed by adjusting the voltage impressed on the armature of the d-c. drive machine by the generator of the motor-generator set. When the unit is used to drive fans, the speed range is obtained by a combination of armature voltage control and field control of the d-c. drive machine. This permits a still further reduction in the rating of the d-c. drive machine so that for comparatively wide ranges of speed, it forms but a small percentage of the total drive unit rating. Twenty-four units of this type, aggregating 7020 hp., are now being built for Powerton Power Station for driving forced and induced draft fans. This system of fan drive is being installed in preference to the two-speed squirrel-cage type induction motor system previously used, because it shows large savings in energy, costs little more, and provides a simple method of fan control which permits the adoption of a simplified system of automatic combustion control. The versatility of the system is further illustrated by a description of a 2500-hp. unit of this type designed to drive a high-pressure reciprocating boiler feed pump. During the first seven months of 1930, orders were placed for 35 of these units ranging in size from 166-hp. to 2500-hp., aggregating 16,000 hp. for installation in four different power stations."
"The danger of over-insulating transmission lines without a corresponding increase in the insulation of connected apparatus is pointed out. To avoid trouble from lightning reaching the apparatus, the Transformer Subcommittee of the Electrical Machinery Committee has prepared a set of proposed rules covering: (1) A practical method of defining the impulse strength of transformers, and (2) recommendation on coordinating the transformer and adjacent line insulation on the basis of impulse voltage strength. It is pointed out that commercial methods for determining the impulse strength of transformer windings by acceptance test in the factory are not feasible. However, investigations in the laboratory show that the impulse strengths of transformer insulation and of standard line insulators or of air-gaps vary similarly with different forms of waves; also that the impulse ratio of strings of line insulators of different lengths is approximately constant for the same impulse waves. The forms of impulse waves actually occurring on transmission lines have not been fully determined. For these reasons the impulse strength of transformers is expressed in terms of the 60-cycle dry flashover voltage of non-shielded suspension type insulators. If the transformer and line insulation are properly balanced with a given wave, it eliminates the necessity of having to consider the different shapes of waves encountered in practise. Three methods are recommended for coordinating the transformer and line insulation, namely, (1) the use of an effective lightning arrester; (2) the use of a horn-gap; and (3) the maintenance of average line insulation for a limited distance from the station."
"Many induction motors do not have the smooth speed — torque curves which are to be expected from elementary theory. Many motors at no-load show a tendency to run at some speed far below that normally to be expected. This is sometimes called “sub-synchronous” speed; or the motor is said to be “crawling.” In the present paper, one cause of this phenomenon is explained. It is found that certain combination of phases, rotor slots, and poles cause the motor to run as a synchronous motor at some intermediate speed between zero and normal no-load induction-motor speed. This effect has been christened the “synchronous-motor effect” in induction machines and is shown to be due to the locking of harmonic fields generated by the stator winding with similar harmonic fields generated by the rotor windings. A method is given for avoiding this trouble by the proper selection of the number of rotor slots."
"This paper describes the energizing and putting into service of the Pennsylvania electrification project. The normal and desirable procedure of placing an electrification into service is cited, and the departure from it brought about by the difficulties encountered in actual railway operation are explained. The operating practise — functions of the power director, his assistants, substation operators, and foremen in connection with switching operations, grounding circuits, carding of circuits and manner of obtaining releases — is described and illustrated. All of this is very essential to properly coordinate the work and safeguard the personnel of the construction forces, operating forces, and test men during the transition period of completion and placing into operation a railway electrification project."
"This investigation was undertaken in order to determine the conditions of atmosphere under which the air capacitor may be regarded as having zero loss. A special guarded and shielded test capacitor was constructed having quartz insulation between the high-voltage and guard plates and low-loss molded Bakelite insulators between the measuring and guard plates. This capacitor was enclosed in a metal box and subjected to various conditions of temperature and humidity. Readings were made of continuous conduction current and a-c. phase defect angle. The measuring instruments used were the most sensitive available. A D'Arsonval galvanometer having a sensitivity of 1.5 × 10−12 amperes was used in the continuous current work and a Wien bridge sensitive to three seconds in the a-c. measurements. A gradient of approximately 4000 volts per cm. was used in all tests. Measurements were made of the effect of humidity at temperatures from 60 deg. fahr. to 100 deg. fahr. and in each run the humidity was varied from approximately 40 to 95 per cent. Readings were made of continuous conduction current and the phase angle of the test capacitor was compared with that of a standard air capacitor in which the humidity was maintained at a low value. It was found that the conduction was zero and the phase defect angle of an air capacitor was less than three seconds for values of humidity below 90 per cent. Observations were made also of the effect of the introduction of ions and dust particles into the condenser chamber."
"A revision of the American Standard “Safety Code for the Installation of Pulverized Fuel Systems” is announced by the American Standards Association. The rapid increase in the use of pulverized fuel in many industries, resulting in new developments in methods and design of equipment, is responsible for the revision. The original code was approved by the American Standards Association in 1927."
"This paper points out the general progress made in the design of electric power systems and contrasts with it the lack of progress in the field of control switchboards. It is shown that due to this lack of progress, a situation confronts many systems today where switchboards are so large that excessive amounts of space are necessary for their housing and further expenditures are later necessary in order to integrate these large switchboards so as to bring them within proper supervisory control of a limited number of operators. A development in miniature switchboards is described, embracing and containing all the fundamental requirements of a control switchboard and yet with no greater space than 4 in. of panel width for complete control and supervision of one feeder. A description of the instrument, control switches, and auxiliary relays, is given as well as the method in which all these elements have been assembled. Reproduction of drawings and photographs are given of actual installations along the lines described, showing the possibility of developing a switchboard that will handle 60 feeders and yet bring it within the range and operating control of a single operator, are given. The advantages of the new development are, as brought out: Compactness, ease of operation, closer supervision, ease of erection, good appearance, and modernity."
"At the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety, in the report for 1929, statement is made that 33,600 people were killed and 1,200,000 were injured on the streets and highways of the country for that year. It was also found that more than 50 per cent of these accidents occurred at street or highway intersections, which are accordingly rated as the most hazardous part of the roadway. To reduce these figures, ever mounting year by year, the intersection should be attacked vigorously by all those interested in an effort to reduce the number of accidents occurring here. The respective number of accidents occurring in daylight and those occurring at night is unknown, but experience has shown that brightly lighted intersections will in a great measure reduce the hazard at night."

"The paper describes recent developments in design of large hydroelectric generators. New features of mechanical construction made possible by fabricated designs are particularly emphasized and illustrations of some recent machines given. The 77,500-kv-a. generators for the Dneprostroy Project in Russia, (which will be the world's largest hydroelectric generators) are described. In conclusion, some of the future possibilities, such as outdoor machines and multi-speed designs, are discussed."
"A review is given of the development of self-propelled railway vehicles which utilize electrical transmission, paying particular attention to the ways and means of regulating the torque demand on the internal combustion engine which serves as the source of power, and the supply of power to the auxiliaries. Two general designs are discussed and classified as “differential field control” and “torque control.” In differentiating between these two systems, two types of differential field control are outlined, giving their major advantages and limitations. The principle of torque control depending upon constant engine speed is discussed, with enumeration of its advantages over previous schemes, permitting as it does the absorption of the entire engine output for any throttle opening and engine speed selected. The differential field control comprises the minimum amount of apparatus consistent with operation of the car or locomotive and its auxiliaries. In connection with this type of control, however, it should be noted that battery charging and air compressor operation cannot be obtained at both operating and idling speeds of the engine. Torque control equipment functions to vary automatically the generator voltage inversely as the current in such a way that the full available power of the engine is utilized; it ads directly on the generator field and has proved its superiority over methods of regulation involving the exciter field. The availability of the auxiliary generator for compressor operation and battery charging when the engine is running under load represents a marked advance in design. The main generator supplies these auxiliaries during idling. The torque control system meets the requirement of any type of engine."
"Corona loss measurements were made on seven different conductor specimens. The losses were measured directly on a three-phase line 700 ft. long by means of three single-phase high-voltage wattmeters. The object of the test was to obtain data for the choice of conductor to be used on a 220-kv. 60-cycle line. The results show the effect of weathering conductors, the comparison of conductors of two different diameters, the effect of size of strands, the method of stranding, and also the effect on new conductors of the change in surface conditions caused by rain and washing."
"Experience has shown that the forces on turbine generator armature windings during short-circuit conditions are large, and that if adequate consideration is not given to the design of the coil bracing and support, windings may be seriously damaged. In this paper the forces are calculated for a particular case by the use of images, the change of flux interlinkages, and by the ∫ H2 ds over some surface in air which surrounds the conductor under consideration. A new and relatively simple proof is given for the validity of the latter method, the limitations and desirable applications of each method being considered. Forces on conductors in armature slots are computed with saturation both considered and neglected. Approximate formulas are derived for the forces on coil sides within one layer of the conical end winding, and for the straight coil extensions from the slots, with a numerical example given for each of these cases. The applicability of certain of these formulas to the phase connecting rings is pointed out, and the force on the entire conical surface of the end winding discussed qualitatively. Certain desirable features of end winding bracing are mentioned, in most of these cases the instant considered being that following a line-to-neutral short circuit when the maximum possible instantaneous current is flowing."
"A disagreeable odor, shot through ventilation lines at the rate of thousands of feet per minute, will be used to warn miners of fire in all metal mines complying with the provisions of the American” Standard code for fire fighting in metal mines. The standard has been approved by the American Standards Association following its submittal by the National Fire Protection Association and the American Mining Congress, sponsors for the joint technical committee which has been working on the standard under American Standards Association auspices since early in 1925."
"From an analysis of precipitation in significant districts of California, it is possible to deduce cycles or recurrences of from 2 to 3 years, from 5 to 6 years, and from 20 to 26 years, these being superimposed upon a longer or secular period of from 50 to 60 years. In this manner an estimate can be made of the rainfall to be expected over a relatively long period — as for the next 10 years; at the present moment, indications point towards greater precipitation and run-off in the period 1930–40 than in the preceding decade. Such estimates are of tremendous economic importance to agricultural interests and irrigation projects — such as the Hoover Dam, which involves storage of vast quantities of water for the creation of electric power and for supplying water to Los Angeles and other portions of southern California. In order to forecast for a year or season at a lime, it is necessary to make a statistical study of meteorological elements (including ocean temperatures) over a wide area during the preceding quarter or six months. Predictions of California rainfall based on the temperatures taken at inshore stations on the South Coast during the summer have been sufficiently successful to justify a continuation of the work. By using composite indexes, it is possible to increase the degree of correlation between computed and observed precipitation to a reasonably high figure."
"The severity of unsymmetrical system faults is affected by the negative sequence impedance of the connected machines. These impedances in turn depend largely upon the character of damper windings. The paper discusses the effect of amortisseur or damper windings upon both the real and reactive components of the negative sequence impedance. Machines without damper windings possess the highest negative sequence reactance and from this point of view, are the more desirable; but machines with high-resistance damper windings possess the highest negative sequence resistance. Calculations show that combining the effect of resistance and reactance, the high-resistance damper is the more desirable. In the event of system oscillations, low-resistance copper damper windings produce the greatest damping of the mechanical movement; however, this effect is unimportant during and following a system fault except in the rather rare case in which the system is so constituted that pull-out takes place as a result of compound oscillations following a disturbance. Consideration is given also to a special type of double-deck damper winding."
"The Supreme Court of the United States, on October 13th gave permission to the State of Arizona to begin an original action in that tribunal contesting the right of the Department of the Interior to proceed with the construction of the Hoover Dam, and directed that process be returnable on January 5, 1931. On the same day, Secretary Wilbur announced that the Comptroller-General had denied the request of Arizona that he withhold approval of the use of funds for the construction of the dam."
"This paper describes the development of the long distance telephone service in Canada, historically, from its inception and the installation of the nucleus of 360 mi., up to and through the present status and lines listed in Table I, to the proposed development represented by Table II, the result of a careful study of calls per day to be expected by 1932. This effort is to provide for traffic requirements in a manner most suitable from a transmission point of view, and to accomplish it with a minimum amount of switching. Much of the engineering work for this is already actively under way and certain work of construction actually commenced. A survey of existing routes and the matter of transmission maintenance discussed."
"The past three years have seen a great increase of activity in the field of a-c. electrification of steam railroads, and consequently much attention has been given to the design of the single-phase traction motors upon which the success of this type of electrification chiefly depends. The object of this paper is to describe the up-to-date motors which have been developed to meet the requirements of modern American railroading."
"The paper deals with the development of the design of the single-phase series motor and some of the main features in both electrical and mechanical proportions which determine the service capacity in the application of this type of motor to railway electrification. Intensive study and development begun in the early part of 1927 resulted in the production of a single-phase series motor with more than enough capacity to meet the present day requirements of the American railroads. A brief description is given of this motor and of some of the novel features which made this recent progress possible. Since this motor was developed, built, and tested, further possibilities of increasing rating or decreasing the size and weight for the same rating have been found and will result in further progress in the design of the single-phase series motor."
"This paper shows the conditions affecting the magnitude and rate of rise of recovery voltage at the terminals of an oil circuit breaker upon interruption of a short circuit; also explaining their effect in quantitative terms. The most common locations, and a rough idea of the magnitude of the capacitances affecting the rate of rise of recovery voltage for various types of short circuit, are indicated, and calculations of the recovery voltage curve for several representative cases at both low and high voltages are presented. In some cases cathode ray oscillograms are given for comparison with the calculated curves. While at present no systematic data regarding the effect of the rate of recovery voltage rise upon circuit breaker operation appear to be available, several tests showing a very pronounced effect — some of them made by the authors and some by others — are reported briefly. There are presented factors whose numerical value lakes into account: the number of phases involved in the short circuit and the ground connections of short circuit and generator; the decrement of short-circuit current previous to interruption, and the effect of unequal reactances in the direct and quadrature axes of synchronous machines. The paper also indicates how one may calculate the effect of displacement and initial load current, besides briefly discussing the effect of saturation. Magnetic oscillograms to verify the most important of the points brought out are shown. A discussion of the method by which overvoltages are built up during the interruption of transmission line charging currents is presented at the end of the paper."
"THE development of arc welding apparatus to its present efficient form has been a gradual process of evolution. In the early days all that was thought necessary for arc welding was a source of power which would supply the proper amperage; the ordinary 110-volt line, transformer, or d-c. generator, were considered entirely adequate. These sources of power were used in connection with a resistance or reactance to control the current to the desired value; in fact, at that time the proper amperage was not definitely known. In general it might be stated that the values of current used, particularly for heavier material, was entirely too low."
"The welding of building structures was discussed at the November 18 meeting of the New York Section of the American Welding Society. The revised code on welding building structures was presented, its chief differences from the former code being explained."
"The Reading Company is now electrifying its Philadelphia suburban railroad service, planning it so that the electrification may readily be extended to include through passenger and freight service between Philadelphia and New York City, and Bethlehem and Reading, Pennsylvania. Contract has been made with Philadelphia Electric Company for initial power requirements, and provisions are made for enlarging such supply to serve all of the above enumerated territory. The Railroad Company is constructing substation and transmission facilities to serve the suburban territory by a 12/24/36-kv. three-wire, single-phase, 25-cycle distribution system, with the view to serving the more remote area by superimposing 66-kv. transmission lines upon the initial system, at the time of future extension. The present and proposed system layouts are described, together with the estimated power requirements and the manner in which the railroad system is to be served from the system of the power company."
"The University of Detroit football field, on which evenly distributed illumination is produced from 320 kw. of electrical energy, is the latest illustration of this type of outdoor lighting. Its economical practicability has been evidenced by a record crowd at each of the games played there."
"A greater use of the carbon arc for the production of ultra violet radiation needed in many industrial irradiation processes has been made possible by the recent development of a powerful carbon arc lamp which has a long burning period and supplies radiation of constant intensity."
"Under the above caption, the IES Transactions for October describes a new device called “breath relay,” which consists of special contacts mounted in a small tube with a mouthpiece like that of a telephone, and is so designed that it responds only to a puff of air. Speaking into it, shaking it, or striking it has no effect."
"The development of radio aids to aviation is being forwarded through work of the National Bureau of Standards, which is operating also as the research division of the Aeronautics Branch, Department of Commerce. In recent months, improvements have been made in equipment for use with the system of radio range beacons which the department is installing on the airways. Since a beginning has been made in the installation of beacons of the type which operate a visual indicator, a greater need has been felt for an automatic volume control on the receiving set used aboard the airplanes. Such a device has been developed at the bureau. It relieves the pilot entirely of manipulation in the use of the visual indicator of the beacon signals. It can be used to advantage also in receiving aural-type beacon signals. Another application is in connection with the runway localizing beacon for use either at airports or as part of the system of blind-landing aids which is being developed at the bureau. In connection with the automatic volume control, a deflection instrument is used which serves as an approximate distance indicator. Recent experiments have also added a means of indicating when the airplane is directly over the beacon transmitter, so that the landing field location is thus conveniently and directly indicated to the pilot."

"In a progress report opposing the Couzens Bill now pending in the Senate (for “the transmission of regulation of transmission of intelligence by wire or wireless”) — Council's Committee on Communication declares that for the present at least, regulation of telephone, telegraph and cable common carriers should remain with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The committee is against the creation of an additional Federal regulatory commission except where existing agencies are not equipped to handle the work. It favors Federal regulation without depriving the states of their legitimate powers over interstate business, and believes that what is really needed is a reorganization of existing governmental bureaus, and legislation which will permit the unified operation of telephones, telegraphs, cables, and radio under governmental control."
"During the two-day session, October 17–18, in Washington, D. C, the Administrative Board of American Engineering Council considered numerous committee reports and matters of concern to the engineering profession. A strong resolution supporting the action of the American Society of Civil Engineers in calling upon the United States Geological Survey for a prompt publication of water supply and other data secured by and through cooperation with the U. S. Geological Survey was adopted. The Board approved the program of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey of the Department of Commerce, and requested appropriations for the purpose of extensive earthquake studies."

"Complaints have been continually received that some Federal Governmental agencies have engaged in or supported legislation which encouraged the practise of permitting government engineers in Federal employment to compete with engineers engaged in private practise. The Board authorized the appointment of a special committee to look into these cases and instructed the committee to render a report in January 1931."
"The Administrative Board endorsed the participation of engineers in the Bicentennial Celebration of the Birth of George Washington and instructed the executive secretary to prepare a suitable resolution upon this subject."
"Although well established in European, schools the importance of vibration in high-speed machinery has been neglected in most American engineering schools. Harvard University is now offering through its School of Engineering a new course on vibration problems, which is intended to acquaint its graduates with the physical and mathematical basis of mechanical vibration and literature available on the subject that they may be equipped to handle problems of increasing speed, size and power now developing in the engineering world. General direction of the course is under Professor Arthur E. Norton, of the School; the instructions will be given by outside lecturers, Messrs. J. Ormondroyd and A. L. Kimball."
"Of particular significance to those interested in the perfection of electrical insulation are two prominent trends of thought exhibited at the recent meeting of the Committee on Electrical Insulation of the Division of Engineering and Industrial Research of the National Research Council. On one hand, it is notable that there is a definite trend toward the concentration of study upon subjects designed to reveal basic fundamentals rather than to provide an immediate answer for any specific operating problem. On the other hand, the admission that there is an unbridged gap between the field of activity of the pure scientist and that of the applied scientist is an important fundamental step toward the bridging of this same gap to the ultimate benefit of all concerned. In the range of the technical program, physics, chemistry, and the specific subject of cable research came in for about equal treatment. It was announced that in response to repeated invitations from that organization, the 1931 meeting of the committee would be held at Harvard University."

"John Castlereagh Parker, Vice-President in charge of Engineering, Brooklyn Edison Company, Inc., Associate Member of the Institute 1904, Fellow 1912, and Vice-President 1920–21, was born in Detroit, Michigan, April 15, 1879. In 1901 he was graduated with the degree of B. S. in M. E. at the University of Michigan receiving his A. M. there in 1902 for advanced work in mathematics, physics and structural engineering. In 1904 the university granted him an E. E. for work done in absentia, his dissertation being “A Physical Concept of Dynamo Electric Machines.”"
"The following paper describes a unique adaptation of the temperature sensitive magnetic alloys known as “calmaloy” to the cold junction compensation of thermocouple temperature indicators. It has been known for some time that certain specially prepared copper-nickel alloys possess the property of changing permeability linearly with temperature over very wide ranges. This peculiar function of permeability has been advantageously used for effecting temperature compensation on different devices, particularly watthour meters. The need has recently arisen of providing suitable compensation for millivolt meters used in connection with thermocouples for determining the temperatures of air cooled aircraft motors. It is shown that by employing the restoring torque on the instrument produced by a small vane of calmaloy in addition to the usual restoring torque of the spring, a very satisfactory compensation results. Curves are shown which illustrate the accuracy of compensation obtained and a detailed explanation of just how it is accomplished is also given."
"The work-place of today which does not have good artificial lighting is, in this respect, an antiquated survivor of yestercentury when artificial lighting was undeveloped. Now, artificial light need no longer be a poor substitute to be used when daylight fails. It costs no more than daylight and it is superior in a number of respects. It can be obtained when and where desired. It need seldom fail. It can be used effectively to supplement daylight, thereby making daytime operations in work-places safer and more efficient. It also makes possible multiple-shift or continuous operation."
"This paper describes a motor which is developed specially for the operation of photophone machinery. The characteristics of this motor are analyzed and demonstrated by oscillograms. Since the well-known theory of synchronous and repulsion motor can easily be applied for this double motor, no equations are given. For illustration of the characteristics various oscillograms and test curves are given."
"A new material has been developed which is peculiarly adapted for use in lightning arresters. Physically, it is similar to dry process porcelain, and it can be made in any shape that can be successfully moulded. The manufacturing processes have been perfected so that the electrical and mechanical characteristics can be duplicated or varied as desired within practical limits. This material, which is called thyrite, does not follow Ohm's law, for each time the voltage is doubled, the current increases 12.6 times. The ratio of change of current to change in voltage is constant over ranges of current of 10,000,000 to one. This means that the resistance decreases as the current and voltage increase. The resistance at any particular value of voltage or current is fixed by the physical dimensions of the piece. It is slightly lowered at high temperatures but returns to normal when cooled. The resistance does not depend upon the rapidity of current or voltage change and it is unaffected by long service. Because of the definite characteristics of thyrite, the action of lightning arresters can, for the first time, be accurately calculated. Thyrite is now being used experimentally in three types of lightning arresters. The station type is made in 11.5-kv. sections, each containing its own gap unit so that no series arrester gap is required. These gap units have the desirable properly of sparking over at practically the same voltage, irrespective of wave front. The 11.5-kv. sections are assembled in the field in the same manner as pedestal insulators. The distribution arresters are smaller than those of the station type and have but one-fourth of the impulse current carrying capacity. For discharge currents up to 1000 amperes, neither of the arresters will allow more than 2.8 times the arrester rating in crest volts to appear across it. The third type of arrester is incorporated directly in the transmission line suspension insulators, and is designed to absorb a considerable portion of abnormal surge energy as well as to protect the insulators from flashover. This new line of lightning arresters has the following advantages: 1. Ample protection for all insulation. 2. Conservative factor of safety from failure. 3. Permanence. 4. Small size and weight. 5. Low installation cost. 6. Invariable characteristics and predictability of results for any given condition. 7. Characteristics which can be measured by the user."
"This paper discusses the well-known calculation of the degree of protection afforded to a transmission line by ground conductors, on the assumption of the sudden disappearance of a vertical potential gradient caused by a charged cloud. Formulas are given for the protective ratio due to one and two ground conductors. It is shown that for any number of ground conductors, it is not necessary to compute the charges on the power conductors."
"This paper describes the design of a large metropolitan system, interconnected with a surrounding high-voltage transmission system. The region included in the scheme comprises an area of 6000 square miles, including the City of Chicago and is served by several companies with systems so interconnected as to form a consolidated scheme of generation and distribution. The physical limitations in locating generating stations within the metropolitan area at the load centers, and the economic advantage of locating stations for the greatest benefit to the group as a whole, makes this arrangement desirable. However, it imposes the necessity of transmitting large blocks of energy and a very free interchange of reserve capacity over the entire system. The system described as contrasted with the “loose linked” and “synchronized at the load” types is solidly interconnected, and because of the nature of its tie connections, it has inherently a very high degree of stability. The service standards of this system require the greatest possible reliability and continuity of supply. The general plan of the system, method of operation, and provisions for protection from the effects of excessive short-circuit currents, are described. In the future development of this system, it is probable that within the next few years a considerable proportion of the total supply to the densely loaded portion within the City of Chicago, will come from stations located quite remote to the load. Energy will be transmitted into the city over a network of transmission lines at voltages from 66 to 220 kv. or higher."
"This paper describes the development of a new autovalve lightning arrester operating on the principle of discharge in restricted passages. A brief résumé is given of the improvements in performance and size desired in lightning arresters. Reference is made to laboratory tests on insulation protected with arresters to determine the limits of discharge voltage required for good local protection. Oscillograms show that the new autovalve arresters meet these requirements. Successful operating experience with these arresters is staled to give final verification of the results obtained in the laboratory investigations. The steps in the development of materials are described and the materials finally chosen and the design of arresters are considered. The performance is discussed and illustrated by oscillograms covering a wide range of currents, both with and without power voltage applied. The size of the new arresters is about one-half that of the present commercial autovalve arresters. One of the probable benefits resulting from this reduction in size is the possibility of making practicable the protection of high-voltage lines against lightning flashover."
"By means of solutions of the induction motor exact equivalent circuit in the form of infinite power series, approximate formulas for the important motor characteristics are derived. These formulas enable the effects of magnetizing current, core loss, and primary resistance on maximum torque, starting current, and so forth, to be readily taken into account with engineering accuracy: A new form of power-factor chart is presented, which permits of the power factor-load curve of any motor being conveniently determined from no-load test data. Exact values of power factor can be obtained from the chart by applying differential corrections, for which formulas are given. The methods outlined were developed to secure an optimum combination of speed, accuracy, and consistency in design calculations, and have been in regular use for the past seven years."
"Surging has occurred on power systems whose transmission distance is small and load density high. The Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has experienced these surges. This paper outlines tests conducted to determine the influence the steam turbine governors have in starting or sustaining a surge condition. The conclusions assumed are: 1. The governor system installed at Colfax Power Station will not start system surging. 2. The governor system will not sustain load oscillations."
"A phenomenon of successive unidirectional discharges of a condenser across a gap placed between its terminals, when the condenser is connected in series with an inductance having such constant that resonance occurs in the system when supplied with alternating e. m. f., is described. An ordinary sphere-gap does not give stable operation for any length of time. A special form of gap which gives satisfactory operation is described. Direct current may be obtained from the system if a proper wave-filter is utilized. Finally, the application of the system as a generator of successive unidirectional voltage impulses is discussed."
"Mechanical oscillations of synchronous motors following the application of abrupt shaft loads have not heretofore been easily calculated for cases of large angular swings, taking into account the damping currents in the rotor, except by tedious point-by-point methods. The chief difficulty has been due to the form of the basic differential equation upon which the solution of hunting problems depends. Within the last few years, Doctor V. Bush and others at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have devised the integraph which is capable of solving the equations of the synchronous motor. Into the integraph are put curves representing the non-linear differential equations and the boundary conditions. The desired results come from the integraph as curves. In this paper, the problem of sudden load on the non-salient pole alternator is solved by the integraph for enough different conditions so that the performance of practically any machine of this type may easily be predicted from the compiled results. Knowing the moments of inertia of the machine and its load, the characteristics of the machine running as a synchronous motor and as an induction motor, the maximum amount of sudden load for which the machine will remain in synchronism may be determined for different values of initial load. Other curves give the maximum angle of the first swing of the rotor and the time interval for the rotor to change from Us initial position to this maximum angle. The simplest type of equation representing an ideal synchronous machine is solved in this paper. The integraph is capable of solving problems of a much more complicated nature than those presented. The more complicated problems pertaining to machines with unsymmetrical excitation and salient-pole rotors will probably be the subjects of future papers."
"The paper describes tests on a transmission line of the Consumers Power Company, using a portable million-volt impulse generator. Data were secured on attenuation with one, two, and three conductors in parallel, with and without ground wires. A study was made of the influence of ground wires in reducing voltages induced by overhead discharging clouds, and also the effect on surges of entering or leaving a section of line having ground wires. A brief study was made comparing steel and copper for ground wires. The effect of ground resistance in lower footings was considered and a method given for measuring surge impedance of transmission lines."
"The paper shows that the well-known circle diagram, first developed for the induction motor, is in reality applicable to the general network, however complicated, and therefore to the transmission line. The double-frequency power diagram is criticised as needlessly complicated, and the well-known constructions applied to all quantities of interest in the transmission line. Since it occupies only a few lines, elementary proofs are given of those parts of general circuit theory needed."
"The discussion relates to the transmission problems involved in short-wave radiotelephony over long distances, and the transmission bases for design of the systems used in commercial transatlantic service. Choice of operating frequencies, amounts of transmitter power, directive transmitting and receiving antennas, automatic gain controls in receivers, and voice-operated switching devices are all factors which may be invoked to aid in solving these problems. The way in which they have been applied in the transatlantic systems and the results which have been obtained are set forth briefly."
"The surge voltage investigations, 1926 and 1927, are briefly reviewed, and data given for 1928 and 1929. The cathode ray oscillograph has played a prominent part in the last two year's work, and about 115 oscillograms have been obtained. The following new instruments were introduced in 1929: Lightning stroke recorders; field intensity recorder; and rate of change of field intensity recorder. A vast amount of progress has been made in the solution of the lightning problem. Personnel, equipment, and technique are available for the complete solution of the problem by means of field and laboratory studies, carried on simultaneously and supplementing each other."
"The fused grading shield was developed primarily to reduce the number of outages due to insulator flashovers on transmission lines. Recent practise of reducing the insulation adjacent to terminals has increased the number of flashovers in these sections. The fused grading shield, while not always economically feasible for entire lines, provides a means of obtaining the reduced insulation without increased outages. Laboratory and field data are presented showing the characteristics of the device as well as the results of several years of operating experience."

"On April 9, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers brought to a successful close the five-day ceremonials of its fiftieth anniversary."
"To Hoover Gold Medal, instituted to commemorate the civic and humanitarian achievement of Herbert Hoover, and tq be subsequently periodically awarded by the engineers “to a fallow engineer for distinguished public service,” was, in its first award at the A. S. M. E. Anniversary Dinner on the evening of April 9, in Washington, D. C, bestowed upon President Hoover. The ballroom of the Mayflower Hotel, in which the dinner was served, was effectively decorated with a profusion of flags, flowers, and the A. S. M. E. emblem. The United States Marine Band supplied the music and President and Mrs. Hoover, escorted by the officers of the Society, were seated at a centrally located table. Doctor Durand, as toastmaster, introduced Doctor Millikan, who took for his subject “The History of Fire” and won from his audience the usual degree of enthusiasm. Dean Kimball then took the chair, calling upon J. V. W. Reynders, Past-President of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, who gave a brief exposé of President Hoover's personal achievements in civic and humanitarian fields; he also outlined the detail of the founding of the Hoover Gold Medal, which, in its first presentation, would be bestowed upon President Hoover, himself. The trust fund by which this award is established was created by the gift of Conrad N. Lauer; it is to be held by The American Society of Mechanical Engineers and administered through a Board of Award comprised of representatives of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. President Hoover in his response to the award expressed his appreciation of this honor conferred upon him by the combined engineering societies, the beneficence of Mr. Lauer in establishing this new distinction among engineers, the application of the national tools developed by science, and the discoveries and inventions which had brought so much of blessing to mankind. “Every county government,” he asserted, “every municipal government, every state government, and the Federal Government itself, is engaged in a constant attempt to solve the multitude of public relations which these tools which the engineers, by their genius and their industry, constantly force upon the very doorstep of the Government.” He closed by saying, “I am not advocating that all public service be turned over to the engineers; I have a high appreciation of the contributions of the other professions; but the engineers, I do insist, have a contribution to make to public service, and they have obligations to give that contribution.”"
"The National Hydraulic Laboratory Bill authorizing an appropriation of $350,000 for construction and installation on the present site of the Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C., of a laboratory building with such equipment and appurtenances as may be necessary, has passed both the House and Senate. The bill as passed by the House contained two provisos not in the Senate bill: The first granted municipalities and state engineering agencies the privilege of consulting the laboratory; the second restricted the laboratory only to such tests concerning hydraulic projects under Federal agencies as were specifically requested by the heads of the departments concerned with the execution of these projects. The bill now goes to conference and it is anticipated that it will become a law within a few weeks."
"Recent announcement has been made that the U. S. 1929 Montefiore prize, which includes the sum of 3000 Belgian francs, was awarded R. D. Evans and C. F. Wagner, — both members of the Institute and engineers of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company who have earned prominence in connection with their apparatus used to demonstrate the phenomena associated with transmission stability problems."
"Within recent years, the subject of bridges, especially toll bridges, has been extensively discussed by members of Congress. There are a number of bills now pending in Congress relating to this subject, and from the trend of affairs, it is evident that sooner or later Congress is going to enact additional bridge legislation."
"John F. Coleman, of New Orleans, President of the American Society of Civil Engineers, has recently accepted membership on Council's Committee on Flood Control. The Committee is now composed of Gardner S. Williams, Cornwell Building, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Chairman; Baxter L. Brown, consulting engineer, St. Louis, Mo.; John R. Freeman, Grosvenor Building, Providence, R. I.; Dr. Arthur E. Morgan, President, Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio; John F. Stevens, Wyman Park Apartments, Baltimore, Md.; and John F. Coleman, New Orleans, La."
"President Hoover has signed the so-called “Public Health Bill,” H. R. 8807, which provides for the coordination of the public health activities of the government. This bill was passed during President Coolidge's administration but was vetoed on the grounds that it limited the constitutional authority of the President to make appointments and that it gave military status to the officers and employees of the service engaged in scientific pursuits."
"“To provide such advice on the qualifications of engineers as will enable the publishers to issue a work which shall be authoritative,” Council has appointed a Committee to cooperate with the publishers in a new edition of Who's Who in Engineering."
"In recognition of the honors which have recently come to him, Carl E. Grunsky, distinguished Californian engineer, recently elected President of American Engineering Council and chosen to receive the Fiftieth Anniversary Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers was entertained at an informal luncheon by the California Congressional Delegation."
"A committee has been formed which will confer with the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce for the purpose of developing a plan whereby the Aeronautics Branch and American Engineering Council may cooperate in formulating a report for the general information and guidance of public bodies, indicating the diversity and importance of engineering problems in the design of airports."
"The hearings held February 10, 13 and 26, before the Flood Control Committee of the House of Representatives of which Frank R. Reid, of Illinois, is chairman, have now been printed and may be had from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. This volume comprises 470 pages of testimony, presented by 37 men, many of whom were Congressmen and Senators from the states of the alluvial valley of the Mississippi River. The principal message which these men brought was that the project adopted in 1928 was not satisfactory, and that additional remedial legislation on this question was necessary."

"Description is given of the lightning field investigation on the 132-kv. Philo-Canton 73-mi., two-circuit line made during 1929 with surge recorders, cathode ray oscillograph, lightning stroke recorders, and a lightning generator. Data are presented on the magnitude of lightning voltage surges, the attenuation of these surges as they travel along the line, and the difference in attenuation between positive and negative lightning surges. The preponderance of positive lightning surges is indicated; but the fewer negative surges produce the highest voltage on the line. The lightning stroke recorders gave data on the polarity of the direct strokes, and the magnitude of the current in the lightning stroke. Lightning arrester performance on lightning and switching surges is analyzed, and typical surges obtained by the cathode ray oscillograph are given for both cases. The magnitude and shape of lightning waves occurring on the line are shown and these waves analyzed as to duration of front, tail, and total length. These data are discussed as they relate to the proximity and rate of discharge of clouds producing lightning surges. General conclusions are drawn based on the data obtained in the investigation."
"The studies were made experimentally and analytically. In the experimental study, a model of hard wood with a multiple of vent ducts of normal width of 3/8 in. each in the stator, the slots and teeth being of approximately average width was used. A four-pole rotor is distinct from one of a large number of poles; consequently two rotors were built, one of four poles and one of twelve poles, the latter being considered as representative of the greater number. The end-bells and the imitations of the end windings were different for the two numbers of poles. In the test results given, data for only standard fiber wedges are included, but other forms were investigated. The vent fingers extended the full depth of the core, thereby enabling measurement to be made of the volume of air per vent per tooth, a rotating vane anemometer with a suitable funnel attachment being employed. The end-bells were solid, simulating standard construction, and the entrances to the two bells were joined to a common duct, in series with which was a thermal volume meter and an external blower of readily adjustable speed. (See Fig. 6.) Pressures were measured in the inner and in the outer end-bells. The rotor of the model was driven by a d-c. motor. with the power input measured. By this means, windage data were obtained and many of the results are included among other data on the curve sheets. For taking a characteristic pressure volume curve, the first reading was taken with the rotor running at a suitable arbitrary speed, with the external blower stationary and its entrance closed. The pressure was then generated by the poles acting as fans, and by the internal fans. For a number of succeeding readings, cardboard orifices with various size holes were placed over the external blower entrance, until that entrance was wide open. Subsequently, the external blower was started, and readings were taken with it running at a number of speeds. The form of curves thus obtained is shown in Fig. 9, the meaning of the three curves being there indicated. One of the limitations imposed by ventilation tests as usually made on an alternator is that only one point on the inner end-bell pressure — volume curve is obtained — nearly that at D in Fig. 9. The data thereby obtained do not enable the designer to estimate the volumes when conditions out of the ordinary are introduced; these would include, for example, the resistance of external ducts of a cooler, or of the influence of greater or less axial length, or of the effect of change in fan proportions, etc. The effects of these and the influence of the structural changes are treated in the paper. At one or more volumes on the pressure-volume curve, volume distribution curves were taken, and from data thereby obtained the influence of axial length was allowed for in the equations derived. In interpreting the results, it is important to eliminate some independent variables. Thus angular velocity may be eliminated, as the pressure is proportional to the square and the volume to the first power of the speed, the shape of volume distribution curve remaining the same. Ample experimental verification was obtained. Machine dimensions were more uncertain, and after many tests, it appears that for a given value of end-bell pressure and angular velocity, the volume distribution for the shorter machine is substantially the same as for the longer machine with the ends removed. As those tests were many, the number of vents, (or length of machine) is considered in the following list of the 11 structural independent variables: (1) Number of poles; (2) fans; (3) number of vents; (4) wedges in stator; (5) interpolar spaces; (6) fan seals; (7) fan shroud rings; (8) field coil braces; (9) plates in end-bells; (10) round and square pole corners; (11) location of fans, data for Nos. 4, 8, and 11 are not given in this paper, and not all for No. 2. There were several unusual results obtained, such as breaks in some of the pressure volume curves for four poles. Data are given for various fans, and also without fans, for both numbers of poles. For twelve poles centrifugal and axial (or “scoop”) fans were studied. In Appendixes 1 and 2, derivations of the more important equations for resistance and volume distribution are given. Appendix 3 covers a method for allowing for air flow through holes back of the core, for various fans and for external pressure drops. In Appendix 4 the equations for parabolic volume distribution and the method of least squares appear."
"The application of short-wave radio transmission to transoceanic telephone circuits is developing apparatus and stations designed specifically to meet the needs of these services.

J., and it outlines some of the radio problems encountered in the station design."
"In the last few years contributions to corona literature by Holm, Ryan, Willis, and others have shown that the space charge liberated by alternating corona reacts on the corona to a high degree in determining its characteristics. This investigation studies the nature of these effects as influenced by variation in the limits of travel of the space charge. The three properties of corona readily lending themselves to experimental observation — the wave form and the value of the corona current, and the corona loss — have been noted when high alternating voltages are applied to a small smooth cylindrical conductor placed successively along the axes of four sizes of metal cylinders. In addition, four frequencies of the alternating voltages were used. All the work has been done under atmospheric conditions. The theory of the influence of space charge as developed by Holm has been tested by experiment and a marked discrepancy is indicated. Values of power loss due to corona, as measured, differ appreciably from those predicted by Holm, but in general follow the quadratic relation suggested by Peek. Unusually large and clear oscillograms afford much interesting qualitative information as to the influence of space charge travel on corona."

Safety gaps with either needle or spherical electrodes. IV. Oil gaps."
"This paper describes the service requirements for the various kinds of load demands in the Philadelphia area. The territory served and the distribution of load in it are also given. The fundamental plan of the system of the Philadelphia Electric Company is outlined, including information on the location and capacity of the principal stations and elements of the transmission system. The various reasons and conditions which have led to the development of the system are explained. The major equipment, such as generators, transformers, synchronous condensers, etc., is described, with particular reference to the adaptability of their characteristics to the conditions to be met. Interconnections with other electric utilities are briefly outlined. The operating procedure relating particularly to allocation of load to the various generating stations, reserve capacity, and frequency control, is discussed and operating experience, including information regarding unstable operation at times of line faults, presented. In conclusion there are also presented the more important basic principles which are followed so far as practicable in the development of the Philadelphia system."
"The paper describes the Norinder cathode ray oscillograph as used in lightning investigations on transmission lines in 1928. It then describes a new model of a cathode ray oscillograph developed for the expansion of field and laboratory tests in 1929. A circuit is shown for obtaining a unidirectional time axis on the oscillograms, in which the timing movement is started by an impulse from the surge to be measured. In the appendix, a simple and concise formula for the sensitivity of a cathode ray oscillograph is developed. This has been derived by Mr. Lewis R. Smith and takes into account the change of the mass of the electron at speeds approaching that of light. At the frequently used cathode voltage of 60 kv., this phenomenon causes a deviation of 5 per cent from the value which would be expected otherwise."
"A review is given of the rules and procedure used in electrical engineering for the calculation of induced voltages in metallic conductors, not including radiation effects. For the e. m. f. in a closed circuit e = — d ϕ/dt, the restriction is slated that the circuit is a closed loop of infinitesimal cross-section and without parallel branches. More complicated circuits are to be calculated by replacing them by a number of elementary circuits. Where there are moving contacts and conductors of finite cross-section, the rule e = B l v should be used. A discussion is given of calculations by considering magnetic fields to have velocities and the restriction is slated that in general, the resultant magnetic field should not be used with the B l v rule, when it is made up of component fields having velocities which differ in magnitude or direction."
"It is pointed out that safe loading of transformers by temperature requires not only an accurate knowledge of the thermal laws but also a knowledge of what is a safe temperature limit to be maintained continuously which condition, with the present method of limiting the load to nameplate rating, seldom, if ever, happens. In view of our present knowledge and experience, the author questions the advisability of loading transformers continuously up to the present A. I. E. E. limit of 105 deg. cent, hot-spot and argues for the establishment of a differential of 10 deg. cent, between the limit to be maintained continuously by means of overloads and the limit to be reached occasionally with rated load. It is shown that by the use of the thermal laws and without increasing the maximum or hot-spot temperature, transformers can be overloaded 1 per cent for each deg. cent, by which the ambient is below 30 deg. cent, (air) for self-cooled transformers; 25 deg. (water) for water-cooled transformers. The results of laboratory aging tests conducted on class A insulations in air and in oil are given. These tests show that the rate of aging is, roughly, double for each 8 deg. cent, increase in temperature. By the use of these data and by integrating the hot-spot temperature rise curve resulting from different load factors, the permissible peak load which causes the same deterioration in the insulation as a steady load is obtained. By combining the two rules, increased kv-a. with lower ambients and increased kv-a. with lower load factors, there is obtained a series of loading curves giving the permissible kv-a. capacities for differentcooling mediums and load factors. On an average, these curves are conservative because they apply to transformers having quite a wide range of characteristics which affect the temperature rise."
"The relationship of the rupturing ability of oil circuit breakers to system stability problems is discussed, and conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness with which the oil must be used in arc rupture if the requirements of stability are to be met. Past attempts to improve the rupturing performance of oil circuit breakers are reviewed and the results of an investigation of the processes of a-c. arc extinction in oil are discussed, from which conclusions are drawn as to the degree of efficiency with which oil has been used in conventional oil circuit breakers. A description is given of a new device known as the deion grid, developed to permit the application of scientific principles to arc extinction in oil, and its theory of operation is discussed, together with the results of interrupting tests in both the laboratory and field Conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness of this device in improving the rupturing performance of oil breakers and its suitability for use where questions of system stability are involved."
"In the following pages, electrical machinery is analyzed from a new point of view. Analytical quantities, like magnetizing current, armature reaction, leakage flux, transient reactance are not introduced; only such quantities are used as actually exist in the machine at one particular load. Thereby the theory of electrical machinery is expressed in terms of the minimum possible number of quantities. No hypothetical currents or fluxes are used and no actual physical quantity is left out. The concept of “free energy,” used in thermodynamics, is introduced and generalized. The criterion of good design of all electrical machines is expressed by a constant, the “thermodynamic efficiency” which gives a measure of the effective utilization of iron and space for the transformation of energy. This constant plays a most fundamental role in the steady and transient behavior of the machine. A method is given by which the direction of flow of energy between different parts of any complicated machine can easily be read from the diagrams. The theory of constant-potential and constant-current electromagnets is used as a stepping stone to show that the theory of the polyphase alternator is identical with the theory of the constant-potential polyphase transformer if flux linkages and magnetomotive forces are interchanged. The circle diagrams of the transformer and the alternator are developed, as well as the elliptical locus diagram of the alternator with salient poles. Problems in the sudden short circuit and the sudden load variation of the polyphase alternator are also solved. Blondel's diagram for the circular locus of the synchronous motor is derived in a more extended form together with its elliptical locus with salient poles. The elliptical loci of the reaction machine and the synchronous converter are also developed. The circular locus for the polyphase induction motor, the single-phase induction motor and the repulsion motor are derived. The method of attack used in the paper is applicable not only to circular and elliptical loci, but also to loci of higher curves. The method is used to develop the complete theory and locus diagram of the double squirrel-cage induction motor and the split-phase induction motor with or without condenser (or the so-called condenser motor). Besides those mentioned above, the writer has also developed with this method the loci of commutator machines such as the polyphase induction motor with commutator rotor, the series polyphase and the shunt polyphase commutator motors, and the compensated series motor, including the effect of the short-circuited brush currents, also the locus of induction motors in cascade. An extension of the concept of free energy establishes the four-line vector diagram and the locus characteristics of any transmission system or any four-terminal network, showing the voltages and currents at both sending and receiving ends. Due to the length of the article, however, their discussion does not appear here. All locus diagrams show the speed and the torque at all loads. They also show the magnitude and phase relation of all actual currents, fluxes, and e. m. fs. A relation of the form r/x is found for the ratio of the work done to the free energy and this one simple formula is sufficient to find the locus diagram and the complete performance of all electrical machinery and transmission lines. It is the only formula used in the paper. In the appendix, the relation of the design constants used to the constants of other methods is shown."
"This paper describes the ground protection in the Brunot Island switch house of the Duquesne Light Company at Pittsburgh, Pa. This switch house constructed on the vertical isolated-phase plan, is divided structurally into several completely insulated sections. The well-known fault ground bus system of protection is applied and made effective by the special features of construction not heretofore used. Details of building construction and of fault ground bus application are given. Arrangements for heating, ventilating, and lighting the buildings are such as not to interfere with phase isolation and insulation. Oil circuit breaker mechanisms are insulated where necessary to maintain insulated sections in the building subdivision. The fault ground bus location, connections, and special details of construction are outlined. Preliminary tests, relay settings, and operating results are given."
"The extinction of an a-c. arc is analyzed as depending on two factors — the rate of recovery of dielectric strength of the arc space after current zero, and the rate at which voltage tending to re-ignite the arc is applied by the external circuit. In the short arc, most of the recovered dielectric strength resides in a deionized layer next to the cathode, but in the long arc, the rest of the arc space contributes largely to the dielectric strength. The breakdown gradient of the still ionized arc space is defined, and using a thermal ionization theory, a formula for growth of breakdown gradient is derived. The extinction of long a-c. arcs in the open is greatly influenced by the sectional area which the arc stream has at current zero. By confining arcs to slots and holes, the rate of deionization at current zero is greatly increased, and so large voltages per cm. of arc can be interrupted. A gas blast passing turbulently through an arc stream greatly accelerates deionization at current zero and so is effective in increasing the capacity of the a-c. arc to interrupt high-voltage circuits. The expulsion fuse is an example of a gas blast circuit interrupter, the gas blast resulting from the decomposition of the fiber fuse case. The oil circuit breaker is also a gas blast circuit interrupter, the blast arising from the gases produced by the decomposition of the oil. Means which increase the rate of oil decomposition improve the operation of the breaker. The magnetic blow-out in oil breakers is effective by causing an increased rate of oil decomposition. Electrostatic unbalance may lower the volts per cm. which a long arc can interrupt. The use of static balancing devices may then become advisable."

"In the Annual Report of Engineering Foundation, Inc., there will appear a notice of the term Fundamental Properties of Dielectrics, adopted toward the end of the year, in substitution for “Dielectric Absorption Research,” as a more suitable brief designation for the work being carried on by John B. Whitehead and R. H. Marvin in the Electrical Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University. Insulating liquids, particularly insulating oils, such as are used in high-voltage transformers of electric current, cables and condensers, occupied attention for the year. Detection and measurement of extremely small values of current and energy loss necessitated great delicacy of manipulation and instruments of unusual sensitiveness. Some of these instruments were devised and constructed in the laboratory. Results are stated, with the technical details of methods, in a paper, The Conductivity of Insulating Oils, by Whitehead and Marvin, presented at the Winter Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, January 1930. The Institute is sponsor for this research, and the information sought by it is important to users and makers of electrical equipment and cables, as well as to producers of insulating materials. From June, 1926 to December, 1929, Engineering Foundation contributed $5750, obtaining $9150 from 18 cooperating companies in addition to services and facilities supplied by the University, and a “grant-in-aid” of $1000 by the National Research Council, for apparatus."
"Fifty years ago, in the face of determined opposition, James B. Eads staked his reputation as an engineer, as well as his fortune, on the success of the Jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi River; a few years earlier he had built at St. Louis one of the world's greatest bridges now carrying loads at that time undreamed of."

He was born February 9, 1901, at Independence, Mo., where he went through grade and high schools; he also attended the Kansas State College at Manhattan, Kansas. During the summer vacation of 1923, he did work for the Kansas City Power & Light Company as cable tester, and in 1925 joined the General Electric Company for work in its Testing Department. On December 29, 1926 he was transferred to the Contract Service Department as Field Engineer on Carrier Current Telephone work. This was his connection at the time of his death."

"Progress in the application of results in the domain of physics has been so rapid of late that there is a temptation to make the general statement that the pure physics of one quarter century becomes the engineering of the next. This, of course, would not be true in all domains of physics, but it is more or less valid in those with which the electrical engineer is most closely connected. The mounting number of uses for devices and phenomena discovered some years ago, for example the vacuum tube, photo-electricity, and the piezoelectric vibrations of crystals, is an apt illustration of the transfer from abstract interest to practical utility. It is, then, quite to the point for the electrical engineer, in forecasting and preparing for the developments of the future, to look to the electrophysics of the present day."
"The Committee on Electrical Machinery takes pleasure in submitting the following report on its work during the past year. The report is divided into two sections, the first dealing with organization and policies, and the second with the progress of the art."
"In the report made one year ago mention was made of the prediction that both coal and metal mining are entering a new era of development. This has begun and indications point to a continuance of development particularly as to mechanization. We now have references made to some modern mines as being 100 per cent mechanized. Future developments will no doubt modify the scheme of application of mechanical operation in many details. Statistics indicate that an increasing percentage of coal is undercut, drilled, and loaded mechanically. This means that added generating capacity and conductors for distribution will be required. Also, inasmuch as power purchased from the utilities is increasing in use at the mines, the mechanization adds to the utility load."
"Statistics on Incandescent Lamp Sales.1 The sale of large tungsten filament lamps (as distinguished from the miniature types) totaled 344,000,000 during 1929, an increase of 8.7 per cent over the previous year's sales. The fact that the production of large tungsten filament lamps alone is running well over a million lamps per working day will give some impression of the extent to which our modern life has become dependent upon this source of artificial illumination."
"Last year, the Committee outlined three suitable methods for correcting results of core loss measurement to a sine-wave basis when made with a distorted wave of applied voltage, and for such correction recommended preference for methods utilizing average voltage. (See Annual Report, Committee on Instruments and Measurements, A. I. E. E. TRANS., Vol. 48, Oct. 1929, p. 1386)."
"The unprecedented activity in the iron and steel industry, which resulted in record production of steel during 1929, is also indicated by the number of rolling mill electric drives purchased and installed."
"Vacuum tubes have been subjects of research for years. Approximately three years ago scientists in General Electric Research Laboratories succeeded in constructing a radio tube having a wavelength of six meters and a frequency of 50,000,000 cycles per second, capable of radiating 10 to 15 kilowatts of energy. This is fifty times as much power as any short-wave tube previously had been able to produce."
"Overhead transmission lines are usually considered to be a class of equipment subject to certain types of troubles which cannot be avoided by means accepted in ordinary practise. It is the purpose of this paper (1) to describe improvements in design of wood pole lines of the 33,000-volt class, which improvements have been developed and applied to the system with which the authors have been identified and which it is believed will greatly reduce the characteristic troubles; (2) to present an explanation of flashovers on wood structures; (3) to give the facts found in field investigations which form the basis for the improvements adopted; (4) to describe the method used for field investigations and analysis of troubles. The studies and investigations referred to deal primarily with the matter of insulation. Considerable information, relative to the insulation values of wood in a structure, as developed by laboratory tests has been published. Experience is cited to show the value of wood insulation in the structure developed from field experience on 33,000-volt lines, and there is presented a practical economical design of wood pole structures using wood braces in place of the usual metal braces which seem practically immune to lightning troubles. Data from laboratory tests are given to substantiate conclusions developed in the field investigations. The performance of insulators with respect to mechanical and electrical breakage is shown, and the use of insulators of more sturdy design is discussed."
"This paper deals with new forms of Lichtenberg figures produced under the combined stress of dielectric and magnetic fields. The effects produced by the magnetic field may be used for determining whether electrons, positive ions, or protons, are basically the active elements in the formation of the positive as well as the negative figures. The illustrations also show that the presence of the magnetic field greatly extends the range of air pressures within which figures of definite form can be obtained, that figures taken at low air pressures possess structures strikingly different from those hitherto known, and that these figures may prove a key to the mechanism of the electric spark."
"Cathode ray oscillographic tests were made of traveling waves passing from an overhead line into short lengths of cable. Single-phase cable lengths of 500 and 1000 ft. were used. Tests were made with a wide variety of conditions, such as cable at end of line, cable between two sections of line, etc. The tests demonstrated that a short length of cable does not act as an effective protective device when connected between station and incoming line. When the incoming wave on the incoming line has a long flat top, several times the cable, length, the crest of the wave passing the cable is decreased only a few per cent by the presence of the cable, although the wave front is sloped off if it was originally very steep. When the wavelength is approximately the same as the cable length, the cable can reduce the transient voltage to less than half of the value without the cable. Recent measurements on transmission lines show that waves do occur with approximately flat tops which are several thousand feet in length. Therefore the cables do not permit the omission of lightning arresters which are means of reducing the potential of overvoltage surges. This confirms the theoretical calculations and the practise of using lightning arresters with cables. The resistance of the ground connection of the cable sheath was found to have important effects. With the cable sheath at the end grounded through 28 ohms, a potential of 82 kv. was measured at the sheath and 105 kv. at the cable conductor. The protective action of lightning arresters was demonstrated by using a gap and various values of series resistance. The velocity of propagation in the cable was found to be about 61 per cent of the velocity of light. The surge impedance of the cable was determined by several methods. Calculations based on the measured propagation velocity and measured capacitance gave a value of about 50 ohms. Some of the other methods gave values of about 100 ohms."
"This paper discusses the major factors contributing to the total leakage conductance of telephone line insulators, especially at carrier frequencies up to 50,000 cycles. The electrical performance of three different designs is analyzed to illustrate in a general way the relative importance of the several factors."
"With the rapid growth of transmission and distribution systems and the tendency to interconnect large systems, the problem of service security during abnormal conditions becomes of greatest importance. Service security is generally considered to be entirely a question of relay protection. This is an erroneous idea, as this paper will show that system layout and other factors are of equal importance, and that only the complete and simultaneous fulfillment of all component factors will bring the desired results. The ultimate goal of the problem is the creation of a transmission system which is free from service interruptions. Upon first thought, this would appear attainable either by preventive measures or by protective measures. This paper will explain briefly the impracticability of the preventive method, and will discuss the possibilities of the protective method in an endeavor to show that it is the only one promising a complete solution of the problem. The protective method depends on the creation of a strong system in which troubles are accepted but made harmless by protective means. The paper indicates also in a general way how such a perfect system can be created at no greater cost than present practise necessitates. The operating results reported in the paper are all from improved existing systems, showing that here substantial improvements can be made."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of a lightning investigation conducted during 1928 and 1929 on 114 circuit miles of a 220-kv. system located in a territory where severe lightning storms are frequent. During the 1929 investigation, which was a continuation and expansion of previous years' work, a number of devices was successfully used, such as surge voltage recorders, cathode ray oscillographs, electric field intensity recorders, and lightning stroke recorders. Some of these devices are new. Many valuable data on magnitude and wave shape of actual lightning surges were obtained, proof of the existence of both single-and multiple-phase faults due to lightning; some data on the shielding effect of overhead ground wires, and qualitative data on the nature and lime of discharge of lightning strokes together with the atmospheric gradients resulting therefrom, were also obtained."
"This paper outlines a comprehensive plan for improved switching of long haul toll telephone traffic in the United States and eastern Canada. A brief discussion is given of the methods of designing the toll plant to give adequate transmission efficiency for all connections established in accordance with this plan. This includes a new method of providing amplification at intermediate switching points replacing the cord circuit repeater method."
"The complete paper consists of three parts; I — Induced Potentials, II — Direct Hits, and III — Other Effects. The work of previous investigators is briefly reviewed, and the limitations of their premises pointed out. Under Part I, a generalized theory of ideal ground wires is offered, taking into account the law of cloud discharge, the distribution of bound charge, and the formation of traveling waves. It is found that the protective ratio is independent of these factors. A more extensive theory taking the additional factors of successive reflections and tower resistance into account is then developed. Part II discusses the probability of a line's being hit, and applies a method for computing the effect of successive reflections to the calculation of potentials on the line and ground wires. Curves of these potentials at successive towers and as functions of tower resistances and of time, are given. Part III discusses the effect of ground wires on attenuation, telephone interference, zero-phase sequence reactance, corona, and the reduction in surge impedance due to the introduction of extra ground wires. There are three mathematical appendixes. In Appendix I, Maxwell's electrostatic and electromagnetic coefficients are reviewed and the theory of traveling waves on any number of parallel wires, including the behavior of these waves at rather general transition points developed. While this extension to the theory of traveling waves was developed incidental to the study of ground wire theory, it is believed to be of considerable interest and value on its own account. Appendixes II and III are the mathematical analyses corresponding to Parts I and II, respectively."
"Rotating machines directly connected to overhead lines are subject to damage from lightning surges. Many methods of protection against such damage are possible and several of them are discussed in this paper. Laboratory experiments have been made to show the normal distribution under various steepnesses of waves, and the improvement of unsatisfactory distributions by means of condensers or lightning arresters connected to various parts of the windings has been studied."
"This paper covers the electrification program of the Pennsylvania Railroad as recently announced and consists of a brief explanation of the reasons for the decision to embark on this electrification program, a review of the operating experiences leading up to the present designs used on the railroad, of catenary and transmission circuits, substation layout and types of equipment, as well as a description of the progressive steps of electric locomotive design which preceded the development of the electric locomotives to be used in this program, and concludes with a brief resume of the points that should be given attention in applying an electrification to a stretch of railroad."
"This paper describes a survey made to determine the range of magnitudes of room noise present in telephone locations. Measurements were made in a total of 260 locations in New York City and environs, distributed among businesses and residences in accordance with telephone traffic distribution. In each location, measurements were made by a marginal audibility method using the human ear as a part of the measuring device, and by a visual indicating meter. A brief description of the apparatus employed with each of these methods is included. Results presented for and measurements made in various classes of rooms, under winter and summer conditions."
"Porcelain insulators have been manufactured and used for the transmission of high-voltage electric power for forty years. The first designs were of the single piece and multipart cemented pin type. Necessity of higher safety factors against flashover and increase in operating voltages demanded a rapid increase in the size of the insulators. This reached an economic limit at the operating voltage of 66 kv. The suspension unit overcame this temporary check of increased operating voltage. Further study of the electrostatic capacitance of the various parts and consequent voltage distribution, made marked refinements in the pin type insulator possible. During this time the single piece porcelain suspension unit took practically its present form. Early improvements were the provision of proper expansion joints and the separation of the lip of the cap from the porcelain hood. Gradual improvements have since been made resulting in a great increase in mechanical strength. These changes have been principally of hardware design. By experiment and analysis the shapes of the cap and pin have been determined to give a uniform distribution of load from the pin to the cap. Constant check tests by the quick pull and time loading methods have shown, that the suspension insulator with properly designed hardware and a suitable coating on the cap to prevent the cement from adhering to the metal, to have a high strength associated with electrical reliability. Ceramic research and exact manufacturing control has made possible the production of non-absorbent, thoroughly vitrified porcelain of consistent strength. This has centered largely about the proper firing of the clay. Recent experiments upon the properties of the combination of porcelain and glaze has eliminated surface stress and consequently assured stronger, longer lived porcelain. Still greater uniformity has been gained by glazing the sanded surfaces. The elimination of the abutting joint and the proper design of the cemented joint has stopped expansion troubles. Proper use of Portland cement has resulted in insulators able to withstand drastic temperature changes without harm. A recent improvement in the pin type insulator is the metal threaded pin hole. This has lessened manufacturing and construction difficulties and in addition due to the exact fit of the insulator on the pin, overcomes hidden corona and the consequent radio interference."

"An automatic arc welding machine, crawling along by its own power, has demonstrated its value in the construction of a new type of steel floor for buildings. The Wendell Garage, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, is the first to use this machine on what is known as the “battledeck type of floor construction,” representing a considerable saving in cost of erection."
"At the recent session of Congress, Public Law 412, Senate Bill 3619, was enacted which gave the President authority to appoint five commissioners to serve instead of the old commission which was composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior and War. Prior to the adjournment of the Senate on July 21, President Hoover nominated Marcel Garsaud, New Orleans engineer, for the three-year term; Ralph D. Williamson, attorney of Yakima, Washington, for the two-year term; and Claude L. Draper of Cheyenne, Wyoming, Chairman of the Public Service Commission of Wyoming, for the one-year term. Although these names were reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, due to the objection of Senate Walsh of Montana, the Senate adjourned without confirming them."
"Upon the recommendation of the Electric Welding Committee of the Institute, the Board of Directors in May 1930 requested Engineering Foundation to sponsor a fellowship at Lehigh University for the purpose of advancing fundamental research in the electric welding art; the particular work to be basic studies on the properties of pure iron electrodes."
"President Hoover has asked the Attorney General for a decision as to whether he has authority under the existing law, to make recess appointments to this Federal Power Commission in view of the fact that the Senate adjourned without confirming them. The Attorney General has presented his findings to the President but President Hoover has not yet disclosed them. It has been proposed that the three men whose names have been submitted be made special representatives of the three secretaries of Agriculture, Interior and War who now comprise the Commission, and that they act as such until confirmed by the Senate in December. In view of the failure of the Senate to confirm a working majority of the Commission, it is highly probable that the affairs of the Federal Power Commission will not be reorganized and stabilized as was intended by the reorganization measure, prior to the spring of 1931."

This study promises to render an unusual service to the engineering profession as well as to the public and the Federal agency charged with the responsibility of maintaining statistical information concerning airports. The development of airports is of such recent date and is playing such an important part in our present-day civilization, that it is felt there is need for the collection of handbook information upon this subject, and the involved problem can be adequately solved only by the employment of the most skilled engineering services from among engineers who have had experience in such matters. The Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce maintains a list of consulting engineers who are available for such work and it will make the results of this study available to them and other engineers."

Hanshue Chair of Commercial Aviation, filled by Earl W. Hill, lecturer in the College of Commerce and Business Administration of S. C, and the James A. Talbot Chair of Aeronautical Engineering, filled by James M. Shoemaker, an aeronautical engineer of wide experience newly-appointed professor in the College of Engineering of S. C, assisted by Captain Douglas Keeney."
"In recognition of his services to the engineering profession as evinced by his successful seven-year fight to secure a National Hydraulic Laboratory, the Louisiana Engineering Society gave ajtestimonial dinner in New Orleans, July 21, to Senator Joseph E. Ransdell. This event was of national significance, not only because it celebrated the enactment of a very constructive piece of legislation but also because it gave the professional engineers an opportunity to recognize and pay honor to a man who had successfully secured legislation which had been supported by the engineers of the United States through American Engineering Council since 1922."

"The problem of telephone interference from a-c. generators, feeding directly on the line with neutral grounded, is discussed. It is shown that the triple and non-triple harmonics in the voltage wave shape cause currents which flow in different paths on the power system. As a result of this, the induction on paralleling telephone lines per ampere of triple harmonic is greater than the induction per ampere for a non-triple harmonic on a balanced power system. A method of measurement which would allow a rough comparison of the effects to be expected from both types of harmonics is suggested. This is based upon using the apparatus already available and setting up special connections for test. Data are given showing the results of such measurements made in the factory on a number of machines while they were being tested. Analyses are given of the wave shape of machines which gave rise to cases of interference. References are given to some of the data already published on methods which have been applied to relieve such situations."
"Experiments are being conducted, according to George F. Paul of Chicago, to determine whether some better method than windows can be devised to utilize natural sunlight for the interior of buildings. There has been established in Chicago a windowless experimental laboratory. This laboratory is flooded with sunlight and sky shine by means of small bull's-eyes that are located along the outer wall and near the ceiling to replace the usual windows."
"The appreciable increase in the rating of generators, generating stations, and interconnected systems has resulted in large currents to be handled by generators, circuit breakers, reactors, cables, and station bus structures. This paper covers a discussion of the limitations on large generators and generating equipment by the present standard voltages of generation, the necessity for increasing the values of generated voltage, and the design, manufacturing, and operating problems involved in building high-voltage turbine generators."
"The paper describes experiments on the charging current and other associated phenomena in high-grade transformer oil. The charging currents remaining after the elimination of the initial transient were studied to within a few hundredths of a second of application of continuous voltage. Two samples of the same oil obtained at different times differed radically. In one case the charging current fell off from the start, while in the other, it remained constant for an appreciable time or even temporarily increased. On reversal of polarity after a long charge, the initial current with both specimens was the same as before reversal, but with one a large momentary increase occurred a few seconds later. Evidence is given on the time of recovery of the initial condition. The existence of space charges in the charged oil is shown, and the time of formation of these charges together with the resulting non-uniform distribution of voltage is measured. Since it is the initial conductivity which determines the a-c. loss, the importance of the charging current in its early stages is emphasized."
"By means of a new device, known as the projection osiso, described in the Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering Society, it is now possible to see sound waves dance visibly across the screen, exactly as these waves dance across the air to an audience."
"This paper describes a 22-kv. metal-clad outdoor type of switchgear. The design is a new departure from customary engineering practise in that all live parts are immersed in oil and enclosed in metal housings with each phase in its own independent compartment. The switchgear insures maximum safety to the operating and maintenance personnel and reduces construction costs for power station switching. The design is well adapted to mass production which should lead toward standardization resulting in a material savings in cost of manufacturing."
"The object of this paper is to describe and discuss a general equation for the induced voltage of electrical machines having parallel coil sides, and which includes as special cases single- and polyphase-induction motors, synchronous generators, d-c. generators, synchronous converters, and static transformers. The application of the general equation to most of these cases is illustrated, and a number of interesting problems which may be solved by means of it pointed out. A characteristic of this equation is that no restrictions are placed on the velocity of the moving conductors, or on the rates of pulsation and rotation of the flux; but these may vary in any arbitrary manner which can be given a suitable analytic expression. The several methods for the reduction of harmonic voltages are classified and their limitations discussed in such a way as to leave in mind a vivid picture of the process. Tables and curves have been prepared for comparing the effects of the skew, pitch, distribution, and phase connection harmonic reduction factors. A new method for summing the finite series of the distribution summations is given in Appendix II of the complete paper."
"Reports from France state that by 1932 about one-fifth of the railroads will be electrified. This movement which was interrupted by the war and by subsequent financial conditions is to be resumed actively in 1930 and 1931."
"This paper deals principally with the physical and technical phases of the development in recent years of “toll” telephone service in this country, with particular emphasis on the longer haul or “long distance” traffic. The very rapid growth in toll telephone business has required a rapid extension of toll plant, including outside plant, buildings, and switchboard and other equipment. The most striking developments in the outside plant are very great growth in toll cable networks and the rapid extension of the carrier telephone systems. The factors involved in the relative use of these various types of plant are discussed. An outline is given of the advance planning and study necessary to insure that these annual programs are properly engineered so that as closely as possible they will effectively anticipate future requirements and extensions in a most suitable and practicable manner. The more important limitations affecting the design of toll plant from the standpoints of the efficiency, quality, speed, and length of telephone transmission, and the specific treatments of each, are generally discussed in the paper. These include such matters as the use of loading coils, vacuum tube repeaters, equalizers for attenuation and phase distortion, and means for reducing the effects of echoes and time lag or delay in the circuits. Mention is also made of modifications of the open wire plant to effect material reductions in crosstalk, and to permit thereby a substantial increase in the use of carrier telephone facilities. The paper discusses the extension of loll service to include connection with the telephone networks in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Europe, Cuba, and South America."
"I ESTEEM it no small honor to be invited to give this memorial lecture; and it is a great personal pleasure for me to do what little I can to keep green the memory of the great scientist, humanist, and engineer in whose honor these lectures have been founded. It was my great privilege to be quite well acquainted with Doctor Steinmetz and, as you know, to be acquainted with him at all was to admire him unreservedly."
"THE general application of arc welding to all types of construction has extended rapidly during the past few years, but not in the field where dynamic stresses were imposed because of the lack of information on the fatigue resistance characteristics of such welded structures. Even as far back as 1911, Stanton1 and Abell2 after making a series of Wohler tests of welded material, advised against welds for variable stress applications. However, recent investigations such as those described in this paper, justify a more general increase in the use of welding under these conditions."
"Experience indicates that if electric light and power systems are to expand indefinitely, without enormous obsolescence charges, a carefully coordinated engineering plan must be adopted and, so far as practicable, system extensions fitted to it. This paper sets forth the principles involved and the plan adopted by the Detroit Edison Company. The description of the area served and the classification of customers indicates that the system is essentially of the metropolitan substation type supplemented by a 120-kv. transmission system. The importance of selecting proper circuit voltages and arrangements and their bearing on service reliability, system simplicity, and cost is discussed. The underlying principles and the “Loose Linked” Power Area Plan adopted to accomplish those principles are set forth. These are supplemented by the plan for short circuit and stability control and the resultant classification of substations, power sources, and protection schemes. Those characteristics of major electrical equipment affected by the plan are outlined. Operating procedure and results are given."
"THE advent of radio broadcasting as a new kind of entertainment in the early part of 1920 immediately created a need for radio broadcasting studios. The development of the broadcasting studio during the four years following its creation has been just as rapid as the development of radio transmitting equipment because of its importance to the proper functioning of the radio broadcasting system."
"The post-war decade, which has given to the technique of the submarine telegraph both the regenerative repeater and the inductively loaded cable, deserves to be chronicled as one of the most significant periods in the history of the cable art. These two major developments, and some important corollary inventions and applications, are discussed in this paper. Reference is made to articles previously published describing recent developments at length. In addition, the paper contains descriptions of: A two-element cable recorder code adapted to land-line transmission. A cable printer system using a two-element code of practically the same time length as three-element recorder code. A typical installation of Pernot superimposed cable carrier apparatus. A brief account of the steps which have been taken to balance an inductively loaded duplex cable."
"The paper describes a research undertaken with the object of throwing light on the relations between the electrical properties of dielectrics or insulating materials, especially on the relation between the “anomalous charging current” under a direct voltage test and the dielectric energy loss for an impressed alternating voltage. After a review of the theory of this relationahip, the methods developed in this study for observing the anomalous charging current in condensers in the time range from 0.0007 to 0.100 sec. after impressing a steady potential are described. The methods used in observing the “normal leakage current” and the alternating energy loss and capacitance in the frequency range from 200 to 4000 cycles per sec. are also described. The results of measurements by these methods on mica, glass, treated cloth, and paraffin paper condensers are given. These measurements include a series giving the effect of varying temperature on the properties of the glass and treated cloth condensers. Finally, the comparisons between the dielectric energy loss and capacitance variation with frequency predicted on the basis of the d-c. anomalous charging current tests and the variations which were actually observed are given. These comparisons show that a fair agreement exists between the predicted and observed curves."
"Large turbine alternators with two similar independent armature windings to permit the electrical segregation of bus sections in large stations without loss of synchronizing power have recently been proposed. Several such generators have been installed or are under construction, and it now seems that they will become of paramount importance in very large future stations. This paper explains the theory and design limitations of these double-winding generators, and describes their application in systems having different types of bus connections."

"Senate Bill 3043 and H. R. 8299 providing for the establishment of a National Hydraulic Research Laboratory in the Bureau of Standards has again been introduced into the present Congress. In the Senate it was referred to the Committee on Commerce which promptly reported the bill out, and it is now on the calendar. Unquestionably it will be acted upon shortly after the Senate disposes of the Tariff Bill. In the house, it was referred to the Rivers and Harbors Committee, which called upon Major General Lytle Brown, the new Chief of Engineers, for a statement on the bill. General Brown appeared before the Committee on February 4 and stated that there was need for such a national hydraulic laboratory as indicated by the bill. He also stated that although he believed the Corps of Engineers needed data from such a laboratory perhaps as much as any other agency of the Government, there were other agencies that also required much more data than now available on the subject of hydraulics."

"The Water Resources Division of the U. S. Geological Survey will obtain through action of Congress $510,000 — an increase of over 100 per cent. This means that all cooperative states will receive assistance from the Federal Government on a dollar-fordollar basis, which is of great significance to the engineering profession and the country at large."
"The appropriation for topographic surveys for next year will be about one million dollars, which is many times larger than ever before. This will be increased yearly so that the topographic survey of the United States may be completed in 18 years instead of in from 80 to 100 years as would be the case under the old program. This means employment of a large number of engineers; and even those not employed will benefit with the availability of adequate topographic maps."
"For the Forest Service there is planned an increase of three and a quarter million dollars. A large share of this increase will be devoted to carrying out the national forestry research program authorized by the McNary and McSweeney Acts passed by the last Congress.

"The experiences of the past year, in visiting practically all Sections of the Institute, lead to the following suggestions in the hope they may be of service in establishing such a plan and possibly placing it in operation promptly. (a) As soon as possible after the election of new Section and District officers, any Section desiring to be scheduled for an Institute Lecture should make application to Head­ quarters through its District Vice-President. (b) Information should be forwarded as promptly as possible from Headquarters to the Section making application, this information to give scheduled date, name of speaker, subject, etc., in order that printing of yearly program of the Section may not be delayed. (c) The financing of each schedule,-possibly two or three the first year and as many as five or six later,The financing of each may be carried out as follows: All travel expenses to be borne by the Institute; all local expenses to be borne by the Section; a committee of the Section to meet the lecturer at the train and care for his comfort as its guest until his -the lecturer to contribute his time and effort in the interests of the Institute and his profession. (d) It is hoped that each year some of the smaller Sections will be placed on the schedules of the President and of each of the lecturers. The small Sections need the stimu­ lus, and the speakers will find great satisfaction in their reactions. (e) With not more than ten or fifteen Sections on any one schedule, and at the rate of five meetings per week, it will require three weeks (more or less) of the time of a lecturer to complete his schedule. (f) To be selected to serve as an Institute lecturer should be recognized as a distinct honor. "
"Lewis Taylor Robinson, Engineer in Charge of the General Engineering Laboratory, General Electric Company, at Schenectady, New York, Associate Member of the Institute 1904, Fellow 1912, Manager 1913–16 and Vice-President 1916–17, 1920–21, was born in Springfield, Mass., October 20, 1868. At the age of seventeen he joined the Thomson-Houston Electric Company at Lynn and was presently put in charge of the Standardizing Laboratory inaugurated by that Company. From that day to this he has grown with the electrical industry, primarily in shaping its standards and in initiating new developments. Union University conferred the degree of Doctor of Science on him in 1929 as “a student in the truest sense of the word.”"
"The paper describes a varying frequency telemetering system which employs an electron tube beat frequency oscillator, the frequency of which is controlled by a small condenser mounted upon the movement of the instrument, the reading of which is to be transmitted. The reading is reproduced at the receiving end by a frequency meter having a scale corresponding to that of the transmitting meter. When furnishing a single indication, the outstanding feature of this system is that except for the movements of the transmitting and receiving instruments themselves, there are no contacts or moving parts. The system does not require instruments of unusual type, and it is not limited only to the transmission of electrical readings, but may readily be applied to any deflection instrument; for instance, indicating pressure, temperature, etc. The accuracy of the system is not affected by changes in the impedance of the channel of transmission. The system is equally suitable for transmission over wire conductors or by means of carrier current or radio. A method which uses automatic telephone type selectors at transmitting and receiving stations and furnishes a number of telemetering indications over a single conducting circuit or carrier-current channel is also described. A feature of this system is that no synchronizing channel or synchronous power is required. By a system of impulses, the selectors automatically establish and maintain synchronism. A field installation which has given satisfactory results is described."
"This paper is descriptive of the 25,000-kv-a., 13,200-volt, 25-cycle, 500-rev. per min., vertical shaft, outdoor type, self-starling, synchronous condensers installed in the Toronto-Leaside Transformer Station, of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. Some of the special problems encountered because of the vertical-shaft, outdoor type arrangement, are discussed.

"This paper describes the preliminary tests, design, and insulation of distribution transformers located underground, instead of overhead on poles, and in direct contact with the earth, in contrast with those located in expensive underground vaults. The preliminary tests indicating the feasibility of such a method of installation are outlined. The special transformer case used, including such details as the water and air-tight inner cover with pressure seal, is described. Buried oil cut-outs of special type where required are also described. The ease of replacing defective transformer coils is also indicated."
"The selection and application of auxiliary electrical devices on a high-voltage multiple unit car is of almost as much importance as the application of the main traction apparatus and requires careful consideration. This paper contains a description of the engineering features as worked out for electrified suburban lines operating on 1500-volt and 3000-volt systems. The control circuits have become very generally standardized at 32-volts, which is also well adapted for interior illumination and headlights. A motor driven generator supplies 3- to 5-kw. power per unit for control lights and battery charging. Such devices as heaters and motor-generator sets, requiring a considerable amount of electrical power, are necessarily constructed to operate at trolley potential. On the 1500-volt system, the compressor can be operated directly from the line potential while on the 3000-volt systems, a double commutator motor driving the generator supplies a 1500-volt source of power for the compressor."
"A 1000-kw. 625-volt automatic mercury arc rectifier substation, installed by the Union Railway Company of New York, in May, 1929, is described in general in this paper together with the account of the automatic and remote control features of the substations. The principle reasons for the adoption of the mercury arc rectifier are mentioned and operating and performance data for the first ten months' operation are presented."
"A Lifetime's work has been primarily with students of electrical engineering, and close connection has been enjoyed with many of them, not only immediately, but frequently for many years after graduation from college. It is natural, therefore, that it is counted a high privilege to have been brought closely into touch with their problems and their aspirations."
"Much has been published lately on the subject of armature reaction, and the designer is now able to predetermine performances with a considerable degree of accuracy; but many of the assumptions made for the purpose of obtaining a mathematical solution to a difficult problem have tended to obscure rather than elucidate the physical conception of armature reactance. This may be of no serious importance when dealing with standard types of design, but in the development of new ideas or in making calculations on abnormal designs, a clear conception of the magnetic flux linking with the armature windings and so causing a reactive voltage is necessary to the development of new formulas or the intelligent application of existing formulas."
"The phenomenon of dancing cables is discussed; the merits of different theories are considered, reference being made to the theory that vibrations of small amplitude but relatively high frequency travel along the line to points where the constants of the line change, as at dead-ending insulators, and there reflect and combine into slower waves of great amplitude. The suggestion is made that much experimental work should be done with regard to these theories before drawing any definite conclusions. Reference is made to Magnus Effect and to the “lift” of ice-coated cables in wind storms. This lift, perpendicular to the direction of the wind, is carefully considered, and diagrams show experimental values of this lift on models similar to the ice-coated cables. The diagrams indicate variations and reversals of this thrust due to small changes of angle of the specimen to the direction of the wind. The suggestion is made that these alternate lifting and depressing effects should be considered as the cause of some, if not a large percentage, of the phenomenal movements of ice-coated conductors in relatively light winds. As in most earlier reports and discussions there does not seem to be any remedy as a result of this study, other than the heating of the conductor electrically to such a temperature throughout sleet-forming periods that the sleet cannot form on the wires."
"The paper discusses the American end of the ship-to-shore radio telephone system and the connecting equipment on board the SS. Leviathan. There is given an outline of previous work in this field and of the technical problem involved in the use of short waves. The station facilities which have been provided for this service on the New Jersey coast are described also the equipment which has been developed for the ship. Finally, the results are given of the first trip of commercial service of the Leviathan."
"The first section of the paper contains a brief review of the general theory underlying the determination of extra copper losses in armature windings carrying alternating current. Simplified methods of calculation are then described. The second part extends the study of the inverted turn transposition to the special case of three-phase windings, with two phases connected in series to form a single-phase winding and the third phase left idle. Formulas and tables are presented to show what reductions in copper losses may be expected for this connection, and to aid in deciding what type of transposition is best for a given winding. The final section of the paper deals with the twisted lead transposition, and presents formulas and tables showing reductions in extra losses to be gained from this method of inversion and connection. Details of the derivations of the formulas and examples of the use of the twisted lead transposition are contained in appendixes at the end of the paper."
"This is a description of a large rural distribution system with some 4800 mi. of primary circuit. The history of the system is given from its inception as a few scattered extensions of town systems up to the present. The paper covers in detail the various forms of construction in use with the reason for their adoption. Comparison of lines are given with various span lengths and voltages. An 8000/4600-volt system has been adopted for part of the district and it is described in detail. In one area, a considable quantity of underground cable has been installed at a cost for single-phase not much greater than for an overhead line."
"Power requirements of the Commission's 25-cycle Niagara System are outlined. Preliminary studies in connection with the choice of transmission voltage, location of terminal transformer station, etc., are discussed, together with the technical studies involved in the design of a system for transmitting 260,000 hp. 230 miles at 220,000-volts, and transforming same at the receiving end, for interconnection with the existing 110,000-volt system. The Toronto-Leaside 220,000-volt transformer station is described, together with the 220,000-volt transmission system. The paper concludes with a résumé of operating experience on the 220,000-volt system to date, and an outline of the future development of the system as at present anticipated."
"Less than four years ago there appeared the following summary of protective relay practise for transmission systems: “Electrical faults on a transmission or distribution system consist mainly of short circuits and grounds. The protective scheme is primarily designed to operate on values of current caused by short circuits between phases…. If the neutral of the system is grounded, the method of grounding has an important bearing on the protective scheme. Where the neutral system is dead grounded, or grounded by means of a low resistance, the protective scheme designed to operate on short circuit usually also protects against grounds.”"
"The increasing demand for frequent and rapid transportation on both suburban and other railways has brought to the fore the multiple unit motor car. The steps taken in the development of the auxiliary equipment for the multiple unit motor coach are quite interesting, and have been made the subject of this paper. The first part of the paper is devoted to cars equipped with apparatus for converting the high-voltage d-c. overhead-line current to the voltages required for operating standard auxiliary equipment. The second part is devoted to auxiliary equipment suitable for operation on the higher d-c. voltages now being used in more and more electrification projects. Although this paper refers mostly to development work carried out in Europe, it is nevertheless believed to be of interest to American engineers as the basic principles underlying this development are also applicable to American multiple unit cars."
"Values of the primary transmission constants R, L, G, and C for open-wire telephone lines are presented, and the factors which affect these constants in practice are discussed. Consideration is then given to the constants which are of principal interest in telephone work, namely, attenuation, characteristic impedance, phase constant, and velocity of propagation. Data regarding these characteristics are given for the frequency range from 0 to 50,000 cycles."
"This paper presents the reasons and evidence which have influenced the authors to favor the proposed recommendations on relation of transformer insulation to adjacent line insulation set forth in a companion paper by Messrs. Montsinger and Dann. The paper first outlines the principal considerations which govern the determination of transmission line insulation on one hand, and transformer insulation on the other. It concludes that the line insulation is a service problem requiring a unique solution whereas the transformer insulation is a manufacturing problem requiring a standardized solution. True coordination of one with the other therefore seems impossible, indicating the need for protective measures at the point of contact. Considerations affecting the selection and characteristics of such protective measures are discussed briefly, and the reasons outlined for believing that at present service experience is a better criterion than research tests upon which to decide such selection. Twenty-five years' service experience on the system now controlled by the Buffalo, Niagara and Eastern Power Corporation, with protective gaps similar to those recommended as one of the proposed protective measures, is described, and conclusion drawn that the use of such gaps under suitable conditions constitutes a satisfactory protective measure."

"The paper discusses the American end of the ship-to-shore radio telephone system and the connecting equipment on board the Leviathan. The most suitable wavelengths for this service are in the short-wave range, but the use of these wavelengths complicates the problem, since different wavelengths are required according to the distance of the ship from shore, the time of day, season of year, etc. The problem on shipboard is further complicated by the fact that the transmitting and receiving systems are necessarily near together and special precautions are necessary to take care of interference from the radio telephone transmitter and the radio telegraphic services. In addition to interference from these sources, there is a background of interference in the ships' electrical equipment, all of which necessitates a much more powerful land station than is necessary on shipboard."
"This paper outlines a comprehensive plan for improved switching of long haul toll telephone traffic in the United States and Eastern Canada. A brief discussion is given of the methods of designing the toll plant to give adequate transmission efficiency for all connections established in accordance with this plan. This includes a new method of providing amplification at intermediate switching points replacing the cord circuit repeater method."
"A two-way television system, in combination with a telephone circuit, has been developed and demonstrated. With this system two people can both see and talk to each other. It consists in principle of two television systems of the sort described before the June, 1927, Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Scanning is by the beam method, using discs containing 72 holes, in place of 50 as heretofore. Blue light, to which the photoelectric cells are quite sensitive, is used for scanning, with a resultant minimizing of glare to the eyes. Water-cooled neon lamps are employed to give an image bright enough to be seen without interference from the scanning beam. A frequency band of 40,000 cycles width is required for each of the two television circuits. Synchronization is effected by transmission of a 1275 cycle alternating current controlling special synchronous motors rotating 18 times per second. Speech transmission is by microphone and loud speaker concealed in the television booth so that no telephone instrument interferes with the view of the face."
"In a previous paper presented before the June, 1927 Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the method of securing synchronization of television signals was described as employed in the Bell System Television demonstration of April, 1927. The present paper describes the development of a new control circuit which is in use in the new two-way television system between the Bell Telephone Laboratories at 463 West Street and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company building at 195 Broadway, New York."
"In this paper is described the speech transmission part of the two-way television system described in companion papers. The system is designed to produce the best possible illusion of face-to-face communication between speakers located at a distance. Some of the novel features of the system described include the use of distant pick-up transmitters and loud speakers concealed in the wall of the booth, also the use of heavy glass windows through which the scanning beam and the reproduced image are projected as a means of preventing the admission of noise into the booth."
"In the Bell System the general objective which has been set up for the transmitted frequency range for new designs of telephone message circuits is a range having a width of 2,500 cycles. extending from about 250 cycles to a bout 2,750 cycles. In determining the frequency range of such a circuit, the cutoff points are taken as those at which the attenuation reaches a value 10 db greater than that at 1,000 cycles."
"The transmission history of long distance circuits, and particularly long distance cable circuits, has been one of continually improving standards. It has also been one of continual reduction of circuit costs. These have resulted largely from new developments to which have been added economies res ulting from heavy growth and improved engineering."
"This paper shows that if, over its transmitting range, the phase shift, B, in radians, of a four-terminal network may be written B = a0 + a1ω (ω = 2πx frequency in cycles per second), there is no phase distortion if a0 = N, N being any integer. However, there is a delay, for any signal, given by dB/dω = a1 (seconds). If N is not an integer, there is a delay, a1, and in addition a distortion, which distortion, generally for speech and music, may be neglected. Typical phase characteristics for lines, filters and all-pass networks are shown. In general over their transmitting range, such phase characteristics which usually are curved, may be regarded as the sum of two characteristics, a straight line having a slope corresponding to the minimum slope of the original and which introduces a delay without distortion and a curved portion to which all of the distortion of the signal may be ascribed. Oscillograms are given showing the distortion for a loaded line and for band filters for a signal which is of the form y sin (ω0 t + θ) between t = 0 and t = T and zero for all other time. A description is given of the means employed for reducing the amount of phase distortion in telephone cable and in low-pass filters in circuits used for program transmission and regular telephone service. Also, phase distortion in repeaters and transformers is described. Brief reference is made to the problem of phase distortion in telegraph, picture transmission, and television circuits."
"This paper deals with the measurement of phase distortion or delay distortion and is particularly concerned with measurements on telephone circuits. For this purpose, use is made of a quantity defined as “envelope delay,” which is the first derivative of the phase shift with respect to frequency. Various methods for measuring this quantity and the principles on which they are based are discussed, the details of the measuring circuits being omitted and sources of further information referred to when possible. Data are included which give the measured envelope delay-frequency characteristics of several kinds of telephone circuits."
"This paper discusses the effects of the type of phase distortion found in low-pass filters and the loaded line on telephone quality. The effects are ascribed to three factors; the first involves the slopes of the phase characteristic at various frequencies in the range of interest, the second involves the intercept values on the phase shift axis of the tangents to the phase curve, the third involves the interference caused by portions of one sound overlapping portions of a succeeding sound. The first factor appears to be the one of most importance."
"The rapid growth of the telephone cable network in this country has made it desirable to develop a system whereby this network may be utilized to transmit programs for broadcasting stations over distances upwards of 2,000 miles. Such a system has recently been developed and given a trial on a looped-back circuit 2,200 miles long with very satisfactory results. It transmits ranges of frequency and volume somewhat in excess of those now handled by the open-wire circuits which are used for program work, and also in excess of those handled by present-day radio broadcasting systems when no long distance lines are involved. The paper deals first with the transmission requirements of broadcasting systems and then gives a description of this new cable system."
"Borkhausen Effect II. Determination of the Average Size of the Discontinuities in Magnetization1. R. M. BOZORTH and J. F. DILLNGER. When the magnetic field-strength acting on a ferro-magnetic material is changed, the magnetization changes discontinuously (Barkhausen effect). These discontinuous changes have been examined in 1 mm. wires; an expression is derived and experimental arrangements are described for determining their average size for a given material in a given state of magnetization."
"This paper presents the results which have been obtained up to the present time in developing telephone communication in the United States of America, this development having been worked out in a form to meet the particular conditions which present themselves in that country. The paper first deals with a brief description of the general structure and organization of the telephone communication system giving the organization of the Bell System which handles the greater part of the telephone service of the country and the reasons for and advantages of this organization. In this connection some figures are presented with respect to the technical personnel who are continuously engaged in studies to develop the art and to provide new methods and facilities for improving the service."
"In this paper the structure and nature of the constituent troostite (found in hardened steels) is discussed. High power metallography was first applied to this problem about six years ago and the early results were presented in an address before the Franklin Institute."
"This paper is a brief discussion of recent developments in American practice concerning radio broadcasting transmitters. Descriptive material and photographs pertaining to several new commercial transmitting equipments are included. Reference is also made to the more important aspects of the related transmission problem. On account of the scope of the subject, the treatment is necessarily superficial, but it may serve to indicate the present status of the transmitter art and its relative position with respect to the industry as a whole. A short bibliography containing some of the more important recent contributions to the subject is attached as an appendix, to which reference may be had for more detailed information."
"The interconnecting of radio broadcasting stations by special telephone lines for the simultaneous broadcasting of radio programs began on a commercial basis in 1923. Today well over 30,000 miles of program transmission circuits are in use in the United States and transcontinental broadcasts by means of such wire lines are a daily occurrence. The paper first states the radio limitations which make wire lines necessary for broadcast coverage of large nations. A map and data are given showing the present broadcasting chains in the United States and indicating the extent of their use. An explanation is given of why program transmission circuits must have transmission characteristics materially different from message telephone circuits and a brief discussion of some of the important transmission characteristics of such circuits, including particularly “frequency range” and “volume range.” The present chains in the United States which are made up almost entirely of open-wire circuits on a voice-frequency basis are briefly described. The manner in which these chains are tested and the way control is exercised are also indicated. To exercise this control requires an elaborate network of telegraph wires now aggregating over 40,000 miles and a corps of special men over 300 in number."
"This paper briefly discusses the following topics: (1) the asymptotic solution of operational equations; (2) Bromwich's formulation of the Heaviside problem, and its relation to the classical Fourier integral; and (3) the existence of solutions of the operational equation. The paper closes with some general remarks on the interpretation of the operator and the operational equation, emphasizing the purely symbolic character of the latter."
"In this article certain of the simple and familiar phenomena of optics and of electronics — for instance, refraction at a boundary between two media, and diffraction by a grating — are interpreted by both of the theories, undulatory and corpuscular, which have so often been condemned as incompatible with one another; the attitude being, that the theories may be brought into concordance by modifying one at least in ways which, extraordinary as they seem, do not quite destroy its character."
"The paper contains the results of a theoretical investigation of wave propagation along a pair of wires that are “loaded” by enclosing each wire in a continuous sheath of magnetic material. The results of greatest practical interest arc certain approximate formulas that are sufficiently simple to be adapted to engineering design studies, while having a high degree of precision for all practical dimensions and frequencies."
"The vibration in the larynx is caused by an automatic modulation by the vocal cords of the air stream from the lungs. Analytically the mechanism is the same, and physically, closely analogous to that of the vacuum tube oscillator. It depends principally on the resonance of the vocal cords, the modulation of air friction in the glottis by their motion and the attraction due to constriction of the air stream between them. When these forces exist in certain relative proportions and phases, sustained oscillation as in singing takes place. The whole mechanism may be represented analytically by force equations, from which conditions for accretion or subsidence of the vibration or for sustained oscillation may be easily deduced. These equations also show the analogy with other types of oscillating systems."
"Note on the Effect of Solar Disturbances on Transutluu tic Radio Transmission1. Clifford N. Anderson. In 1923 when the relation between abnormal long-wave radio Taransmission and solar disturbances was first noted, the outstanding abnormality was the great decrease in night time signal field strength accompanying storms in the earth's magnetic field. There was a slight increase in daylight signal field but this was distinctly secondary to the effect upon night field. Previous to 1927, data on signal fields were limited to one set of measurements a week, and although daylight signal field strengt hs were higher during periods of increased magnetic activity, it was somewhat difficult to determine the effect of individual storms. The present notes show the effects of individual storms of 60-kc transatlantic radio transmission and also give some indication as to their effect on short-wave radio transmission."
"An account is given of the activities of the Chemical Department of the Bell Telephone Laboratories. In the Laboratories chemists act chiefly as advisers and critics. They concern themselves with such problems as the theory of chemical structure as related to dielectric properties and simultaneously attack the task of making an improved substitute for gutta-percha which renders possible a transatlantic telephone. They are interested in the colloidal structure of cotton and silk and the influence of moisture and electrolytes on their insulating properties. The dispersion hardening and fatigue resistance of lead and its alloys, the fabrication of platinum-alloy vacuum-tube filaments, and of new magnetic materials such as permalloy and perminvar have required their attention. The corrosion of cable systems is due largely to stray currents but is strongly influenced by chemical factors. Other underground corrosion, and particularly the slower and more insideous corrosion and tarnishing of indoor telephone apparatus, have justified a broad program of investigation of the corrosive factors involved in ocean, earth, and atmosphere. Related to these studies arc those of protective finishes, whether metallic coatings or organic paints and lacquers. The permanence of a great variety of materials must often be predicted as best it may without the test of service life. This interest in permanence is reflected in a program of experiments in preservation of telephone poles."
"This is a report of the Joint Subcommittee on Development and Research, National Electric Light Association and Bell Telephone System. It was prepared by the Chairmen, respectively for the Bell System and the N.E.L.A., of the Project Committee assigned to this study. The report reviews the history and present trend of the design of telephone transmitters and receivers, particularly from the standpoint of their response frequency characteristics, and discusses the possibility of obtaining a reduction in the effect of line noise by shifting their points of maximum response. It is concluded that no advantage from this standpoint is indicated inasmuch as it has been found that the distribution with frequency of the extraneous energy on telephone toll lines is approximately uniform over the more important portion of the frequency range. It is further stated that the present trend in improvement of the response characteristics of transmitters and receivers is in the direction of reducing the difference between their maximum and average response."
"This paper describes some of the results of the work of the Joint Development and Research Subcommittee of the National Electric Light Association and Bell Telephone System on the mutual impedances of ground-return circuits. The first part of the paper deals with some experiments which were performed to establish an experimental background for the testing of theoretical ideas. Different theories, one involving an “equivalent ground-plane,” a second a d. c. distribution in the earth, and a third an a. c. distribution in the earth, are discussed in the light of the experimental results. While none of these is adequate to explain all the observed phenomena, each has a field in which it can be made useful. The second part of the paper is devoted to a description of practical means for predetermining the mutual impedances of power and telephone lines. This involves an experimental determination of a curve of mutual impedance as a function of separation in the region of the proposed exposure and the calculation of the overall mutual impedance between the proposed lines from this curve and the dimensions of the exposure. The results of trials of this method in two locations are given which indicate that itshould be of sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes."
"This paper describes a survey made to determine the range of magnitudes of room noise present in telephone locations. Measurements were made in a total of 250 locations in New York City and environs, distributed among businesses and residences in accordance with telephone traffic distribution. In each location, measurements were made by a marginal audibility method using the human ear as a part of the measuring device, and by a visual indicating meter. A brief description is included of the apparatus employed with each of these methods. Results are presented for measurements made in various classes of rooms, under winter and summer conditions."
"This article deals with a couple of aspects of one of the amplest questions of modern experimental physics: the question of what happens when an electron (more generally, an electron or a proton or a charged atom of any kind) collides with an atom or a molecule. It is well known, of course, that if the electron has energy enough, it may excite or ionize the atom. There are many different modes of excitation, and often several of ionization; the variety of possibilities is wide. If any of them occurs at an encounter, the electron loses energy and speed, and may suffer a change in the direction of its motion — a “scattering,” as this is called. Even if it loses no measurable amount of energy at a collision, it may be “scattered,” that is to say, deflected. The scattering and the energy-losses of the electrons are studied both on their own account, and because of the light they shed on what is happening to the atoms."
"This paper discusses the major factors contributing to the (total) leakage conductance of telephone line insulators, especially at carrier frequencies up to 50,000 cycles. The influence of both the design and material of the insulators and pins on each factor is discussed and illustrated by test data. The electrical performance of three different designs is analyzed to illustrate, in a general way, the relative importance of the several factors."
"Values of the primary transmission constants R, L, G, and C for open-wire telephone lines are presented, and the factors which affect these constants in practise are discussed. Consideration is then given to the constants which are of principal interest in telephone work, namely, the attenuation, the characteristic impedance, the phase constant, and the velocity of propagation. Data regarding these characteristics are given for the frequency range from 0 to 50,000 cycles."
"This paper deals with a mathematical discussion of induction due to transient currents of the forms I = sin ωt and I = e−βt. Formulas and curves are developed for the calculation of the induced voltage in exposed telephone lines due to currents of the above types."
"The present importance of wave filter impedance correction arises chiefly from its relation to crosstalk in carrier systems. Briefly, it appears that line transpositions, an effective remedy for many types of crosstalk, are less satisfactory when directed against the so-called “reflected near-end crosstalk” and “reflected far-end crosstalk” produced when waves reflected from the junctions between lines and repeater equipment of carrier systems induce currents in neighboring systems. The expense of the elaborate transposition scheme necessary for a substantial reduction in these types of crosstalk makes it desirable to diminish the amplitude of the reflected wave as far as possible by the improvement of the impedance match between lines and repeaters. A detailed study shows that this is most conveniently done by terminating the filters in the repeater by sections whose image impedances at one end match the main body of the filter, while at the other they approximate constant resistances, matching the terminal impedances. The development of appropriate filter terminating sections has passed through a number of stages. The earliest filters gave reflection coefficients as great as 50% to 60% in the useful transmission band. The invention of “m-derived” and “x-terminated” filters, plus a number of more or less empirical schemes, made it possible to obtain reflection coefficients ranging from 10% to 15% in the useful band. Recent progress has resulted chiefly from the development of a series of sections, the simplest of which is equivalent to the m-derived type, while the others, of progressively increasing complexity, give progressively better approximations to the ideal characteristic. The use of the more complicated sections has made it possible to reduce filter reflection coefficients to the order of 2%, or even less. At present the chief limitation appears to be the difficulty of manufacturing filters with sufficient precision to allow the theoretical characteristics to be realized. The paper is illustrated by figures showing the various stages of this progress as they are exemplified in actual designs."
"This paper gives a theoretical treatment of some recently developed wave filter terminating sections whose application is discussed in the accompanying paper on “Impedance Correction of Wave Filters.” The sections consist primarily of non-recurrent ladder networks which operate, over the transmission bands of the associated filters, as transformers whose ratio varies with frequency. The transformation ratio of the network is specified, as a function of frequency, by a power series containing a limited number of terms and the design procedure therefore depends upon the construction of power series approximations to the ratio between the resistance of the filter proper and the desired resistance. A separate network is added to secure control of the reactance component. An increased number of terms in the power series, and therefore an improved approximation to the desired transformation ratio, can be obtained by increasing the number of branches in the network. The method thus leads to a series of sections of progressively increasing complexity and with progressively improving impedance characteristics. By an inversion of the analysis a second series of sections can also be obtained. The paper is chiefly devoted to a discussion of these two series of filter sections, but other possible applications of the method are also described briefly."
"A Space-Time Pattern Theory of Hearing.1 HARVEY FLETCHER The pitch of a tone is determined both by the position of its maximum stimulation on the basilar membrane and also by the time patternsent to the brain. The former is probably more important for the high tones and the latter for the low tones. The loudness is dependent upon the number of nerve impulses per second reaching the brain and possibly somewhat upon the extent of the stimulated patch. The experience called by psychologists “volume” or “extension” is no doubt identified with the length of the stimulated patch on the basilar membrane. This extension is carried to the brain and forms a portion of excited br ain matter of a definite size. It is then this size that determines our sensation of the “volume” of a tone. The low pitched or complex tones hav e a large “volume” while the high pitched tones have a small one."
"The subject of engineering materials is one of increasing importance, as is evidenced by the expenditure of over a half billion dollars annually in new construction by the Bell System. This has led to the concentration of the research and engineering work on materials in a group devoted particularly to this field of activity. Studies of the chemical and physical properties of materials must be combined by the materials engineer with a knowledge of the operating requirements of telephone apparatus. The paper covers broadly the materials used in communication engineering and gives instances in which the needs of the telephone plant imposed requirements which were not satisfied by commercially available materials. Some of the instances cited are phenol fiber having improved resistance to arcing for use in sequence switches; a composite molded plastic for use in terminal strips; textile materials for central office wiring treated to improve their electrical insulating quality and non-ferrous metals of more uniform characteristics. Problems involving the use of duralumin for radio broadcasting transmitters and the light valve used in sound pictures are also described. Particular emphasis is laid on the benefits resulting from the continuous research in magnetic materials which have produced successively — powdered electrolytic iron cores for loading coils, permalloy, and recently perminvar. Summing up, the work on materials has resulted in benefits along two general lines: 1. Improvement in quality of commercial materials. 2. Discovery or development of valuable new materials."
"The discussion relates to the transmission problems involved in short-wave radiotelephony over long distances and the transmission bases for design of the systems used in commercial transatlantic service. Choice of operating frequencies, amounts of transmitter power, directive transmitting and receiving antennas, automatic gain controls in receivers, and voice-operated switching devices are all factors which may be invoked to aid in solving these problems. The way in which they have been applied in the transatlantic systems and the results which have been obtained are set forth briefly."
"The application of short-wave radio transmission to transoceanic telephone circuits is developing apparatus and stations designed specifically to meet the needs of these services. This paper describes from the radio point of view the important technical features and developments incorporated in the new transmitting and receiving stations of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company located respectively at Lawrenceville and Netcong, New Jersey, and it outlines some of the radio problems encountered in the station design."
"This paper presents data concerning the vocabulary and the relative frequency of occurrence of the speech sounds of telephone conversation. Tables are given showing the most frequently used words, the syllabic structure of the words, the relative occurrences of the sounds, and, for each vowel, the percentage distribution of the consonants which precede and follow it. Comparisons are made with the vocabulary and relative occurrence of speech sounds in written English."
"This paper gives a simple theorem determining relative transmission efficiencies in a two-way transducer, and showing that the conditions for equal efficiencies of transmission in the two directions are simply those for maximum output and maximum reception of energy. The theorem is then applied to radio communication and a second theorem stated and proved by which the ratio of the transmitting efficiences of any two antenna systems is expressed in terms of their receiving efficiences. The paper closes with a mathematical note on a generalization of Rayleigh's Reciprocal Theorem."
"The approximate equivalent electrical networks of acoustic filters are developed in this paper, from the lumped-constant approximation networks for electric lines. In terms of this network, design formulæ have been developed for all single band pass filters. It is possible, from these formulae, to determine the physical dimensions of an acoustic filter necessary to have a given attenuation and impedance characteristic."
"The subject of this article, the ionization of gases by ultraviolet light, is a narrow but singularly inviting department of modern physics. The obstacles to experiment are so great that they are only now being overcome by the latest improvements in laboratory technique; nearly all the valuable data are of recent acquisition, and the period of discoveries is not yet past. Some of the results afford excellent confirmation of present atomic theory; others are still obscure and challenging."
"This paper deals with the position of equilibrium of a loop of wire in a steady transverse wind and with the swinging of such a loop in one or more gusts of wind. In the first part, the loop is assumed to be inelastic and to swing as a rigid body. Under these conditions, nomograms are given from which may be read the deflection of loops of wire .104′′ or .165′′ in diameter as a function of steady wind velocity. The maximum additional swing of such a loop with a single gust and with a succession of gusts of given peak velocities may also be read from the nomograms. A chart is also included giving the effect of wind velocity on the sag of .104′′ and .165′′ hard drawn copper wires at tensions and span lengths common in the telephone plant."
"That we cannot make all pieces of a given kind of product identically alike is accepted as a general truth. It follows that the qualities of pieces of the same kind of product differ among themselves, or, in other words, the quality of product must be expected to vary. The causes of this variability are, in general, unknown. The present paper presents a scientific basis for determining when we have gone as far as it is economically feasible to go in eliminating these unknown or chance causes of variability in the quality of a product. When this state has been reached, the product is said to be controlled because it is then possible to set up limits within which the quality may be expected to remain in the future. By securing control, we attain the five economic advantages discussed in Part III."
"The suggestion is made that the sound damping material in an auditorium should be such that the loudness of tones will decay at the same rate for all frequencies. To attain this the reverberation time at 80 cycles must be twice what it is at 1000 cycles. The change of optimum reverberation time with volume is shown to be derivable from a single hypothesis."
"Phenomena in Oxide Coated Filaments1. J A BECKER. A theory of the changes in activity in oxide coated filaments is proposed. From a comparison or the behavior of these filaments and filaments with composite surfaces such as thorium on tungsten, ciesium on tungsten, and caæsium on oxygen on tungsten it appears probable that oxide coated filaments owe their high activity to adsorbed metallic barium. The changes in emission from a coated filament produced by changes in plate potential and by currents sent into or drawn from it, are ascribed to electrolysis of the oxide. When electrons are sent into a coated filament barium is deposited on the surface and the activity increases until an optimum is reached beyond which the activity decreases, When current is drawn from the oxide, oxygen is deposited on the surface. If the oxygen is beneath the adsorbed barium, it increases the activity: if it is above the barium, it decreases the activity. Both barium and oxygen diffuse readily from the surface into the oxide and vice versa. This theory i tested. confirmed, and exten ded by numerous experiments."
"The Society of Motion Picture Engineers was founded in the year 1916 by Mr. C. Francis Jenkins for the purpose, as expressed in the Constitution, of “advancement in the theory and practice of motion picture engineering and the allied arts and sciences, the standardization of the mechanisms and practices employed therein, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge by publication.” From its inception, the activities of the Society, including the proceedings at the semi-annual conventions, have been recorded in the Transactions. The initial amount of published scientific data was of very modest dimensions, in 1920 the size of the Transactions had increased to 240 pages; in 1924 to 508 pages; in 1927 to 768 pages; and in 1928 to 1200 pages. Up to this period, the engineer had been regarded by many motion picture executives as a being very much apart from the industry and, in fact, one of the outstanding executives admitted at a banquet tendered by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to the Society in Hollywood in 1928, that previous to that occasion he had not even heard of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers."
"At various times during the past six or eight years it has been suggested that the Society of Motion Picture Engineers should publish a monthly journal in lieu of its semi-annual or quarterly Transactions. The Board of Governors has discussed this proposal from time to time but not until recently has it seemed wise to commit the Society to an undertaking involving the necessarily increased financial burden. Within the last year or so, however, the membership has increased to such an extent that the Society's income is appreciably enhanced. About a year ago, President Porter appointed a committee to consider the desirability and feasibility of the Society undertaking the publication of a monthly journal. The committee was instructed to report its findings to the Board of Governors in order that that body might take some definite action on this subject. The personnel of the committee appointed was as follows: Messrs. P. M. Abbott, J. W. Coffman, W. B. Cook, W. C. Hubbard, P. A. McGuire, H. T. Cowling, and L. A. Jones, Chairman."
"In selecting this subject I may be taking many of you over familiar territory. Nevertheless I have chosen “Sound Motion Pictures in Europe,” because I regard it as the outstanding problem confronting American exporters of motion pictures today."
"It has been claimed that there is only one standard of measurement which is common to all nations of the earth. That measurement is the width of a piece of standard theatrical size motion picture film."
"Since the birth of the motion picture some thirty years ago there have been discussions from time to time concerning the most satisfactory shape of the picture area. In the early stages of development several different shapes and sizes were proposed and tried experimentally. Using the ratio of width to height as a specification of the shape of the rectangle, we find among the very early productions values of this ratio varying all the way from 1.25 up to 2.0. Practice finally crystallized, however, and a rectangle having a width of four units and a height of three units (R = 1.33) was adopted as standard. This continued as almost universal practice until the advent of sound which, in the case of sound-on-film positives, necessitated the narrowing of the available picture area in order to provide space for the photographic sound record. If the height of the positive image is maintained at its old value, that is, four perforations less the necessary allowance for frame line, the resultant positive picture area has a ratio of approximately 1.15."
"The employment of film wider than the standard 35 mm. seems imminent. No one can say whether we will have to deal with one size or several, but, however that question may be settled, the difficulties encountered in designing adequate optical systems are of the same kind in all cases but differ in degree with the variations in width of film and size of projected image. It seems probable that they are of sufficient interest to this Society to justify a brief statement of them and of the degree to which we have been able to meet the requirements."
"Modern motion pictures, and especially motion pictures synchronized with sound, have of late brought about a new problem bearing within itself as far reaching consequences as any problem the industry has had to face since its advent. We refer to the obviously insistent demand for a complete departure from old established standards and the creation and establishment of picture images of more appropriate size and proportions."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the fundamental basis of sound recording as applied to motion pictures and to give certain results which have been obtained by the use of these principles in the actual production of pictures for release. The quantitative methods of applying the material have not been completely worked out and the work described is therefore largely of a qualitative nature. Some indication has been obtained, however, regarding the approximate magnitude of the more important factors."
"A year ago Dr. Paul E. Sabine presented a paper before this Society on “The Acoustics of Sound Recording Rooms.” I must refer you to Dr. Sabine's paper for a fuller discussion of the fundamental principles of auditorium acoustics, but wish to review one aspect of the problem. The most common fault of auditoriums is excessive reverberation. This can be cured by the introduction of sound absorbing materials. On the other hand it has been possible to carry this process too far and obtain a room with too little reverberation."
"Recently much concern was aroused among Hollywood studio technicians by the fact that in some theaters the heads and feet of characters, important words in titles, and other vital elements of the picture were being cut off in projection of sound-on-film pictures."
"The advent of sound pictures is, no doubt, the chief single cause of the practical importance now conceded to acoustics. The science of acoustics is being greatly extended and altered by this most popular diversion."
"There are at the present time two types of loud speakers generally available for use in theaters, the horn type and the free radiator baffle type. Although these two types as usually used in theaters are similar in that they employ moving coil driving elements, they differ materially in their performance characteristics, and for theater purposes where large sound powers are required these differences become very important. Some of the inherent characteristics of these two types of loud speakers are discussed in a general way in the following paragraphs and the effects of these characteristics upon the requirements of theater systems are illustrated."
"Much has been said about the conflict, real or apparent, between science and religion. We also hear of bickerings between science and art. It would seem that Lady Science, to whom we all profess devotion, has her very feminine moments devoted to spying upon her sisters, whom she scandalizes by broadcasting the intimate items she discovers by such investigations."
"The various methods and general principles involved in the recording of sound by photographic methods are too well known to require detailed description and discussion. The methods at present in use commercially may be divided broadly into two classes: (1) The variable density type, and (2) the variable width type. The former may be subdivided, with respect to the method used for obtaining the variable exposure, into (a) those using the “light valve,” and (b) those employing a “flashing lamp.” In variable width recording the film is moved at a uniform linear velocity past a slit, or an optical image thereof. By suitable means the transverse length of this slit image is so modulated that the exposed area varies in lateral dimensions giving a sound record of the so-called “saw tooth” type. 9t any point within the exposed area the exposure incident on the photographic material is constant, both factors of exposure, namely, intensity (I) and time (t), being constant. This statement requires some modification since with the film moving continuously in one direction past a slit of finite width and the boundary of the illuminated area moving in a direction perpendicular to that of the film there must be a narrow envelop in which the t factor of exposure varies to some extent."
"The advent of sound in the motion picture field and the growing popularity of color productions, as well as the imminent changes in the size of motion picture film, have raised many new problems throughout the industry from the standpoint of the producer, the laboratory, and the manufacturer."
"A great deal of the equipment now used in the recording of sound pictures is highly unreliable and full of trouble."
"The most important items of progress during the past six months have been the extensive use of all-color sound pictures, or pictures with extensive color inserts, and several demonstrations of enlarged projected pictures by the use of film wider than 35 mm."
"Practical experience has shown that with newly processed motion picture positive prints it is necessary to apply some form of lubricant to the film surface in order to facilitate the passage of the film through the projector. Sound record prints require similar lubrication in which case it is very necessary that the applied lubricant should not be the cause of extraneous noise in the projector-reproducer mechanism."
"The amount of light used at the aperture plate of the motion picture projector has steadily increased until at the present time only the high intensity are can furnish the light concentration necessary to satisfy the demands of the larger theaters. Recent changes which have been made and rumors of others about to occur in the motion picture industry have again emphasized the constant demand for more light on the screen of the theater. It therefore seems desirable to call attention to certain characteristics of high intensity arcs which may help in the solution of the ever present problem of increasing the useful light."
"In the operation of a vast chain of theaters catering to almost seven hundred thousand patrons daily, with over ninety per cent of our theaters equipped with sound installations, our organization is in a position to study the requirements and reaction of the general public in the acceptance of the sound motion picture. I am glad to have this opportunity to make a few observations on this absorbing subject."
"The usual method employed in designing an optical system seems to consist in assembling a collection of lenses and trying them in various combinations and positions until either the patience of the experimenter is exhausted or an optimum condition seems to be reached. This criticism does not apply, of course, to the optical systems of telescopes or microscopes, but rather to systems like that of the motion picture projector where it is relatively easy to obtain satisfactory definition in the image but difficult to secure enough illumination on the screen. Curiously enough, this unsystematic method of design procedure seems to be peculiar to optics, and is certainly due in part to a lack of knowledge concerning the performance that could be expected of an ideal optical system. In other branches of physics, such as heat, for example, there is the well-known and widely employed concept of thermal efficiency. Every heat engine or other piece of thermal equipment is rated by the closeness of its approach to the performance of an ideal apparatus which is assumed to operate without losses. In a previous paper, the present author has attempted to establish a similar basis of comparison for optical systems based on the conservation of energy principle. The purpose of the present paper is to apply the results to motion picture projectors."
"It is hardly more than a year since sound pictures took their place as the major part of studio production programs. In that year an enormous amount of progress has been made, alike in the artistic utilization of the new form, and in the technic of its operation. Studio personnel has grown increasingly familiar with the sound device, and this familiarity has resulted in the overcoming of many of the obstacles which the coming of sound was thought to have placed in the path of true screen technic."
"The word “illusion” is one of the most patient and long-suffering in common usage. It is a favorite with the official propagandists of the film industry, sharing honors with the appellations, “box-office appeal” and “sure-fire smash.” We have many “illusions” in our industry, but the one for which we all strive is the “illusion of reality,” which is also the ultimate goal of all other forms of synthetic entertainment. Motion pictures, with or without sound, constitute a medium of expression, and accordingly must be governed by certain fundamental rules."
"Footage numbering has been used on the edge of motion picture film for some time, and has proven to be a great aid in cutting and assembling silent pictures. With the introduction of sound, a separate film is used for the sound track, and it is very desirable for cutting and matching that the sound track bear the same numbers along its edge as does the picture negative. The device, which I am about to describe, numbers both films in the camera while the picture is being made, thus substituting for the present numbering system a different one better adapted to sound pictures."
"The ordinary applications of incandescent lamps in lighting our homes, offices, and cities seldom bring to our attention or consideration the quantity of heat which is produced as a necessary consequence to the light emitted by incandescent tungsten. However, in certain special applications of high intensity illumination, such as the lighting in motion picture studios and the projection of motion picture films, the intense heat not only is brought to our attention, but is impressed on our minds through physical discomfort."
"Radiomovies for entertainment in the home have progressed rather satisfactorily during the year. Our audience on 46 meters has grown in a year to some 18,000 or 20,000. To distinguish them from the radio fan with a set which covers only the entertainment band from 200 to 550 meters most of this audience are known as amateurs."
"A splice in motion picture film which bears a sound record usually introduces extraneous noise in the reproduced sounds unless some means is taken to obscure it. Rapid variations in light transmission of the sound record area are productive of sound and the reproducing equipment is, of course, unable to distinguish between the record proper and such extraneous variations."
"Ever since the beginning of photography, the judging of light value has been one of the great problems, to the photographer or camera man. In many cases in the past as now, the person responsible for taking of pictures is required to judge light values using his naked eye as an indicating means. His accuracy or ability to do this is the product of his appreciation and his experience as received through this natural indicator. The unassisted eye at its best is considered unstable with a possible error of 100 percent or more from day to day when used as a light intensity measuring instrument. It is unreasonable to expect that two or more men would come very close in a simultaneous check. In order to assist the eye in measuring light and to obtain consistent results, several types of photometers have been developed. In most cases, these instruments are rather awkward to use because they require a comparatively slow process of matching of light intensities, to obtain a reading. Therefore, they might be classed as laboratory equipment, from a studio standpoint, rather than practical and portable direct reading indicators."
"In the operation of motion picture projectors, where the film is synchronized with sound recorded on a disk or on a film, the standard speed of the projector is 90 feet per minute or 24 frames per second."
"At the May, 1924, convention of the Society, a paper was presented by Mr. J. A. Ball on the subject “Theory of Mechanical Miniatures in Cinematography.”1 This dealt with the relation of length and time as seen from the motion picture standpoint. It is the purpose of this paper to revive this subject with the hope of making clear some points which may have been vague to many at the time."
"Before describing the actual applications of flexible drive shafts to motion picture equipment, it might be well to give you as briefly as possible a general description of flexible shafts and their characteristics. Although there are over thirty million feet of flexible shafting used yearly in practically every type of industry in this country, engineers as a whole are not generally familiar with the technical characteristics of this product."
"The fine grain borax developer formula, originated by J. G. Capstaff and R. A. Purdy, was presented to the trade in the Eastman Duplicating Film booklet issued in January, 1927, and has since been widely adopted."
"The large electric utilities of today are interested not only in the kilowatt hour sales, but also in the most efficient use of that energy by its consumers. The Department of Water and Power of Los Angeles endeavors to identify itself with the industries it serves by coöperation with its consumers to the fullest extent. This department has established very low rates for energy and also has assisted in solving technical problems which arise in the utilization of that energy."
"The lighting industry from its earliest beginnings to the present time has been under a peculiar handicap because man's best efforts in the production of light have always yielded results different from the light of nature under which mankind has developed. It is no mere accident that the human eye is most sensitive to those rays of the sun that are received most abundantly at the earth's surface. This condition may be looked upon as a natural result of evolution and, if the facts were otherwise, it would be a matter for profound speculation. But while the eye has adapted itself to the light of the sun, there are other natural and artificial factors to be considered."
"It is necessary that photographic films be thoroughly washed after fixing; otherwise, if any appreciable quantity of sodium thiosulfate or other sulfur-containing compounds remain in the film, sooner or later they react with the silver image to form silver sulfide with the result that the image becomes brown, and it is said to have faded."
"The Bell & Howell Company has recently brought out a new model 16 mm. camera, which is known as the Filmo Model 70-D. It presents such a departure from the Design 70 models, that it is not expected to supplant them but is considered as an entirely new member of the Filmo family."
"A leading figure in the industry was addressing a meeting of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. “I agree with the previous speakers,” he said. The first rush of talking picture production is settling into a longer and steadier stride. We have revolutionized a great creative art and business to the end that it shall be a more expressive art and a better business. New methods to use new machines to secure new effects were thrust upon us hardly more than a year ago. It was the work of a good many days and nights as well to get on friendly terms of acquaintanceship with them."
"In a previous report, the Theater Lighting committee's preliminary survey of lighting conditions in theaters was described and the plans for a more extensive survey discussed. It was first thought that it would be desirable to obtain data in a relatively large number of theaters, getting as complete information as possible, including phases not embraced in the preliminary survey, and a complete test outline was worked up."
"In its initial report to the Society last Spring the Projection Committee stated that the ventilation section of the report was far from complete, but promised to go more thoroughly into the matter in the succeeding six months."
"The second meeting of this season, held in the new factory of the Mitchell Camera Corporation on Thursday, February 27, 1930, was called to order by Mr. Peter Mole, Chairman of The Pacific Coast Section, at 8:30 p.m."
"Arrangements for the Spring meeting of the Society to be held at the Wardman Park Hotel, Washington, D. C., have been announced by the Chairman of the Convention Committee, Mr. W. C. Kunzmann."
"Recent fires both in the East and in the West have more than ever attracted the attention of the various fire underwriters and fire prevention bureaus to the necessity of formulating rigid and definite requirements in connection with the vast amount of electrical work now being installed or contemplated in the studios, laboratories, film exchanges, and theaters."
"The fundamental requirement of a silent cover—“bungalow,” or “blimp,” as it is colloquially called—is that the device shall effectually keep the camera noise from getting out on the set. In general, it can be said that any device which lets camera noise be heard by a person of normal hearing standing more than four feet from the camera in an absolutely silent room, is not sufficiently quiet to cover all conditions. This is the fundamental consideration; all others, while they may be of major importance, are secondary to this."
"It has been pointed out by one of us1 that many of the commonly accepted theories regarding the mechanism of speech production are erroneous. Heretofore, visual observation of the laryngeal cavity by means of special instruments supported by the evidence of X-ray pictures during phonation has been utilized in these studies. In the present paper we describe a new method of approach, a method which, when it is perfected, promises to be most valuable both in the continuance of the studies and in the presentation of findings to an audience. The motion pictures which have thus far been made, though their photographic quality is in no wise as good as we believe we can obtain, nevertheless indicate clearly the possibilities of the method."
"In presenting this paper to you, we are fully conscious of the fact that some of the apparatus which will have to be used in connection with our idea has not yet reached the final stage of development. Thus far, we have produced operative apparatus only, but rapid improvements are being made, and we are assured by those immediately concerned that this improved apparatus will be available very shortly."
"In considering the relative merits of sound-on-disk versus sound-on-film, there are a number of factors which must be weighed. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods must be considered from a standpoint of sound quality, operation, and cost; and each factor must be considered practically as well as theoretically because we all know that the indications of theory are not always realized in practice."
"From the beginning of the motion picture the possibilities of its application to the field of medicine as an educational medium and a means of satisfactory record has been well recognized by the motion picture profession. Because of this current feeling there has been a constant effort to produce satisfactory pictures. Medical motion pictures invariably deal with a specific type of subject in which the emphasis lies in detailed structures, which as a rule depend on differentiation of fine color gradations for their successful interpretation. Unfortunately these predominant hues are found in the red end of the spectrum, that portion which the earlier photographic materials were unable to record correctly. This situation, together with the fact that photography on 35 mm. film is expensive considering the small distribution and limited use to which medical films are subject, tended to discourage the progress of these pictures."
"The origin of the distortions which occur in the photographic sound recording process may be classified in four general groups, namely, electrical, optical, mechanical, and photographic."
"The notes and information which follow treat very briefly the activities in the sound film industry in France for the late months of 1929 and the early part of 1930. This information is followed by descriptions concerning some innovations in motion picture apparatus, both planned and effected in France during these months. Only the most interesting of these will be described."
"At the present time the production of motion pictures in Austria is limited by lack of financial support. In Vienna, the center of the Austrian film industry, there were several important studios before the war, while now there are but four. Three of these are in current use and are very well equipped. They are not used by one company alone, but are rented to different ones in turn. The fourth studio, which is better equipped than the others, is not in use at present. It has been purchased by an English company, has been rebuilt for sound work, and production is scheduled for an early start."
"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to bring to you tonight the greetings and the congratulations of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood and to congratulate you on the tremendous strides of achievement that you have been responsible for within the last two years."
"In the early days of motion pictures, projection objectives were supplied in a series of focal lengths which differed from each other by only an eighth of an inch. The burden of making and carrying in stock so great a variety of focal lengths became oppressive for both the manufacturer and the dealer and, in consequence, the Society at its Chicago meeting in 19171 adopted as standard a series of focal lengths in which the interval between numbers was a quarter of an inch. This practice has been followed up to the present day. The only further attention given by the Society to the subject of projection lens focal lengths consisted in adopting a standard permissible tolerance of plus or minus 1 per cent.2"
"At the mention of photo-electric cells, the mind usually visualizes a glistening silver bulb that serves the magical purpose in sound projection heads of converting a varying light beam into electrical impulses that eventually reach the audience as intelligible sounds. This electrical eye finds in the flickering light beams from the celluloid ribbon, voice, music, a pistol shot, or the murmur of the sea. In visualizing this every-day magical device, we neglect to include other types of photo-electric cells that have in the distant past and may in the near future have an important bearing on the development of sound picture systems."
"The accumulation of valuable original negatives and master positives by the Eastman Kodak Company and the Eastman Teaching Films, Inc., during recent years has necessitated the construction of a suitable depository for this film."
"Mr. Roebuck, in 1918,1 and Mr. J. G. Jones, in 1923,2 presented to this Society papers in which the all-important matter of film sprocket design was discussed and formulas given which served as a basis for the calculation of the diameters of the film sprockets; the pitch, thickness, height, and shape of the sprocket teeth to permit the accommodation of a chosen range of film shrinkage."
"In the design and selection of a suitable screen for use in sound picture systems, it will generally be recognized that the problem may be treated under two general headings, namely, that relating to the optical properties and that relating to the acoustic properties."
"“There are,” said Mark Twain, “three sorts of prevarication—plain lies, damn lies, and statistics.”"
"The dependence of the optical density of developed photographic materials upon the method of its measurement was first demonstrated by Callier.1 He discussed the effect of light scattering by the photographic image and presented data which seemed to justify the empirical relation: $D||\\, = QD\\parallel\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!-$ where $D||$ (specular density) is the value obtained with the developed image in a specular beam, $D\\parallel\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!-$ (diffuse density) the value obtained with diffuse illumination, and Q a constant factor greater than unity."
"In the production of talking motion pictures, it is generally advisable to depart as little as possible from the technic that has proved so successful in making silent films. We are interested in obtaining moving “talkies” and not the “talkie stills,” which were only too evident in some of the earlier efforts. This effect may be secured partly by the use of sound pick-up devices, which permit an actor to move about the set at will, and partly by having stages and sets of little or no reverberation."
"In a previous communication1 J. G. Jones described a machine for applying a thin line of paraffin wax along the edges of motion picture positive film to serve as a lubricant and facilitate the passage of newly processed or “green” film through the projector. The wax was applied by means of two thin steel disks which dipped partly in a pan of melted wax fitted with an electric heater, while the film was led over these disks emulsion side down."
"Before consistent faithful reproduction can be accomplished with the variable density system of recording, it is necessary to determine the proper exposure range and development of both the negative and the print. Predetermined characteristics have proved a help in determining these factors."
"As many of the members of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers are aware, the Jenkins Laboratories have been broadcasting radiomovies from 8 to 10 p.m., E. S .T., every evening, except Sundays and holidays, for nearly two years."
"At a recent meeting of the Board I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Hickman to report on the urgent problems which have arisen since local sections have been formed within the Society."
"In the latter part of 1929, the Board of Directors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, acting at the suggestion of the Producers' Branch, launched two major projects for the general technical benefit of the production industry. The first of these projects was the establishment of a school for the education of studio personnel in the fundamentals of sound recording and reproduction. The second was the organization of a Producers-Technicians Committee for the conduction of a group of new technical activities."
"The history of the motion picture business is a history of unexpected accomplishment and unrealized opportunity. Its success has ever been greater than anyone expected it would be; its influence has gone far beyond the wildest hope of even its most enthusiastic visionaries. Its success, in short, has been too good to be true."
"The desire to reproduce motion in pictures, for the purpose of study and analysis, is the origin of the great motion picture industry. The stroboscope, as you know, was one of the early and rather crude instruments developed for motion study, and, strange as it may seem, its basic principles are still employed universally wherever motion pictures are shown. I refer particularly to the picking out of portions of a complete action by the shutter mechanism of the motion picture camera, and the presentation, through the medium of an intermittent mechanism, of these same portions of action on the screen of the theater. Such a recording and reproducing system, involving intermittent film movement, must necessarily fall far short of the ideal for the following reasons:"
"When sound motion pictures were first produced in the Hollywood studios, the sets were small, and no great difficulties were encountered in concealing microphones within the set, so that sound could be satisfactorily picked up."
"Though there has been considerable progress made in silencing the movements in motion picture cameras, there are not at present available many cameras sufficiently silent, so that they may be used without the additional sound-proofing of a camera booth, or with what we term a “blimp” or “bungalow” camera housing."
"The proper regulation of volume or apparent loudness is essential to good reproduction of sound. This is particularly true when the sound forms a part of a sound picture, as the success of the latter in producing an illusion of reality is greatly affected by sound volume. If the recording has been well done, and if the theater apparatus is in good condition, the picture may still be poorly shown if the sound volume is improperly handled. This is clearly a matter of showmanship, and must be studied as such. The definition of suitable volume is simple. It is the volume at which the desired illusion is obtained. The illusion of reality which results from such a combination of sound and scene is such that little imagination is required to think of the scene as being real. The attainment of this result is the goal of all sound picture productions."
"In investigating the behavior of electro-mechanical systems the method which invariably seems to be readily applicable is that of measuring the effect by a disturbance of known character and magnitude applied to the system. Sometimes it is far more simple and economical, especially when we are concerned only with qualitative measurements, to observe not the final effect but the reaction of the system to the flow of energy supplied by the source."
"The most significant events of progress for the fall and winter of 1929–30 have been the increased production of feature pictures combining sound and color, and the marked improvement in sound quality and in picture artistry. The technical quality of color pictures, however, still leaves much to be desired and further improvements must be made before the full benefit of color will be realized."
"In a previous paper, the results of an extended investigation of the properties of fixing baths compounded with potassium alum were given.1 In the present paper, the results of a similar study of stop baths and fixing baths containing chrome alum will be outlined."
"In order to establish harmonious and profitable relationships with a new element of individuals among students of science, it is essential to know something of their origin, their habits, ambitions, and ideals. At this particular crossroads in the progress of your industry I make your acquaintance as a member of a profession which, by the assistance of the modern allied sciences, has been able to merge out of an age of mysticism, sorcery, and ignorance."
"This is intended to give a general picture of the part played by the Western Electric sound recording system in connection with the production of talking motion pictures. It is not proposed to introduce any new material but an attempt is made to trace the sound, with particular emphasis on sound recorded on films, from the time it originates in the studio until it is finally ready for theater projection. Some of the many details which are necessary and which must be properly correlated in order to produce a satisfactory product are discussed."
"The photo-chemical action of light on the photographic plate depends on the light intensity and on the length of exposure, other conditions being constant. The brightness of the photographic image is proportional to the square of the ratio of the radius of the entrance pupil to the focal distance, or to the square of the relative aperture, which latter may be expressed by 1/n, where n = f/d (d is the diameter of the entrance pupil). The illumination afforded by a photographic objective is determined by its relative aperture, on purely geometric considerations. In this expression of the relative aperture, there is no factor expressing the light losses in the lens which decrease the effective illumination of objectives; for example, the losses caused by reflection at the lens surfaces, by absorption in the glass, and by absorption in the cementing material. If we designate by I0 and I the intensities of illumination before and after passing through the objective, the true, effective brightness of a photographic objective is more accurately given by the expression."
"My task cannot be completed in the space at my disposal, nor could it properly be accomplished in six times the space. I propose therefore to confine myself to dealing with the essentials of present day cameras, i. e., the feed and take-up sprockets, the take-up tension, and the intermittent motion. To these points I shall particularly direct your attention. The present day camera, with its reversing gear, method of focussing, changing of lenses, diaphragms, fades—hand and mechanical—high speed fittings, speed indicators, air drives, etc., has now become so complicated an instrument, that a book could be written on any one of its features. In the first days of the industry the progress of the moving picture was much handicapped by the want of accurately perforated film, nevertheless the pictures, unsteady and flickering, were, on their introduction, so much of a surprise to the public, that the production of pictures of any kind was considered of more importance than the production of good pictures. Money could be made quickly by those in the know, and much more attention was paid to the money-making side of the business than to the technical problems involved in the improvement of the product. I am sorry that after thirty years of work, in many corners here today, the taint still remains. We, in this country, have suffered badly in consequence. Neglect of the technical side was the direct cause of a great portion of the trade going away from this country. May I express the fervent hope that the establishment of this Section of the Society may be an important factor tending to remedy this defect."
"Dimensions of Newly Cut and Perforated Film."
"The ultimate goal in theater reproduction of sound motion pictures is the complete simulation in each part of the theater of the sound originally impinging upon the pickup microphone. This goal is at present far from having been achieved, one of the weakest links in the chain between sound striking the microphone and the sound impinging upon the ear of the auditor being the loudspeaker."
"The continuous projector described briefly in Volume XII, Number 36, of the Transactions under the classification, “Symposium on New Motion Picture Apparatus,” is essentially a precise optical instrument requiring a higher degree of accuracy in manufacture than is customary in optical work. The lens wheels, shown in position in the mechanism (Fig. 1), are the essential and characteristic elements of this projector. In order that the screen image may possess the critical definition and the steadiness essential to good projection and may also have, to the fullest extent, the peculiarly pleasing qualities this system of projection is capable of producing, it is essential that the lens wheels be accurate."
"One of the most important of the problems which arise in the photographic recording of sound is that of defining for the film laboratory workman the procedure by which he will obtain the most satisfactory results. This problem as it presents itself in the case of the variable density record has been the subject of several papers which have been read before this Society. The purpose of the present paper is to present an analysis for the case of the variable area record."
"The earlier workers who recorded on, and reproduced from film will no doubt recall the poor high frequency response obtained. It has never been particularly difficult to obtain fair reproduction between the frequencies of 1000 and 2500 cycles from phonograph records, but many of the early film reproducers suffered severe losses in even this restricted range. It was soon found that the width of the beam of light which fell on the film played an important part in the reproduction of the higher frequencies. It was obvious that if the thickness of this beam of light should happen to be an integral number of wave-lengths of the recorded signal, no sound corresponding to that wave-length could be reproduced. It was also recognized that this effect was present in recording as well as in reproducing. Moreover, it is evident that this effect is oftentimes made more serious by the lens system. In order to explain the aperture effect, it is desirable to examine the complete process of recording and reproduction by means of a rectangular beam of light whose thickness in the direction of film travel is small. A little consideration shows that the same reasoning applies to both systems of recording under certain assumptions. For simplicity, the variable amplitude system will be examined. It will be evident that the ideal aperture is supposed to measure only the amplitude of the wave. In so far as area is involved, distortion results. This is mentioned because sometimes this system is called variable area recording. It is more correctly called variable amplitude recording."
"In certain types of optical motion picture printers, it is desirable for the film, in its printing position, to be curved along its length. With certain pull-downs, for example, it is almost essential that a curved gate be used; and in some cases it is possible, by using curved gates, to dispense with pressure pads and thus avoid the difficulties attendant upon accumulated dirt, grease, and emulsion."
"The desirable properties of chrome alum fixing baths are analogous to those of potassium alum fixing baths as outlined in a previous paper.1 A satisfactory bath should have the following properties: (1) It should fix the film sufficiently rapidly and should have a fairly long fixation life; (2) the bath should harden the film to a sufficient degree and should maintain its hardening properties either with or without use; (3) it should not sulfurize prematurely at temperatures below 85°F.; (4) the propensity of the bath to deposit a sludge on the addition of developer should be a minimum; and (5) there should be a minimum tendency to produce blisters even when used in conjunction with a strongly alkaline developer."
"Reproduction of speech and music with motion pictures is intended to augment enjoyment derived by theater audiences. Of the factors which contribute to ease and pleasure of listening to reproduced sound, the quantity (loudness) of sound available to listeners ranks in importance with the quality of reproduction. Quality is of little avail when satisfactory loudness does not accompany it, and increase of loudness cannot compensate for quality that is poor. Sensation level influences intelligibility and naturalness of speech and music and, therefore, must be considered an important element in the promotion of satisfaction with sound picture presentation in theaters."
"In the process of recording sound on film by the variable area method, it is necessary to modulate a narrow beam of light in such manner that its length at any instant is directly proportional to the sound pressure on a microphone diaphragm. This result has been successfully accomplished in four steps as follows: (1) A microphone converts the sound energy into electrical energy. (2) An amplifier makes it possible for the microphone to control a relatively large amount of electrical energy. (3) A galvanometer converts this electrical energy into mechanical energy in the form of rotational vibrations of a small mirror. (4) An optical system enables the mirror to control the length of a small beam of light which is focused upon the film. This paper is concerned with a description of several types of galvanometers used in this process and a discussion of factors in their design."
"At the fall meeting in 1927 a paper on Micro Cinematography was given in which the usefulness of the motion picture not only for the demonstration of microscopic phenomena but also its application in medical and biological research work was described."
"So far as I am aware all the thousands of engineers who are engaged on television development are working on the same method of analysis and synthesis."
"The following notes are intended to give a brief description of methods of incandescent lighting employed in British studios with particulars of the theory and design of some of the apparatus used, showing how this apparatus differs from Continental and American practice."
"The addition of sound to motion pictures has introduced many new problems in acoustics which have heretofore been subjected to but meager quantitative analysis. Judgment of “good” or “bad” acoustics has been based on the results of direct listening rather than on those of sound recording. A room or sound picture set may be acoustically good for binaural listening at a given place but may not be good for recording with a microphone placed at that particular position. One reason is that when one listens to a sound he uses two pick-up devices, the two ears. Any distortion of the sound at one ear may be balanced by that which the second receives. In the case of recording we use a single pick-up device, a microphone, which sends on to the sound record any distortion which may be present at the point where it is placed. Due to the fact that the ears add sound effects without reference to phase while multiple microphones combine amplitudes, the use of two microphones does not accomplish the balancing process obtained by the ears. Distortions of the sound field at the position of the microphone should, therefore, be avoided. If a sound record is to give a satisfactory reproduction of the original sound, the microphone must be placed at a point where the intensities of all the frequencies bear the same relation to each other that they did near the source.** Any departure from this relation results in distortion. One of the main causes of this type of distortion is the interference at the microphone of two or more sound waves coming from the same source by different paths. While this phenomenon is not novel, the character and extent of the distortion which it introduces in sound picture recording has not been fully appreciated. Recent experiments carried on in the Bell Telephone Laboratories have shown that this distortion is responsible for a hollow unnatural quality when it occurs in sound picture records."
"The use of motion pictures for purposes of instruction had received the serious attention of educators prior to the advent of sound pictures, and collections of motion picture films on a wide variety of instructional subjects had been made by government organizations and private institutions in this country and abroad. The recording of current events in newsreel form and films illustrating industrial processes are popular types of such pictures. Additional subjects prepared specifically for instruction in public schools and in advanced institutions of learning were also available."
"However simple a piece of apparatus the phonograph needle appears to be, as a necessary link in the chain of reproducing equipment it must be as strong qualitatively as every other link, or the elementary principles of design are violated. One needs to calibrate only a few kinds of phonograph needles to find that quality of sound which has been achieved at the cost of thousands of dollars can be considerably impaired by using an improperly designed needle costing only a fraction of a cent."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe and demonstrate an improved synchronizing apparatus for 16 mm. films with disk records which in general may be attached to any 16 mm. projector without any change being required in the projector itself."
"The papers committee asked me to outline the results of my observations on the proper method of maintaining correct screening continuities and synchronization in the handling of sound film in exchange operation. I have also been asked to state my opinion of the effect that dirt, oil, and scratches accumulated in average projection runs on sound track prints have on sound reproduction."
"Before speaking about the Soviet cinema and the Soviet cinema industry, I want to say a few words about the cinema of pre-revolutionary Russia."
"Architectural acoustics was placed on a scientific basis by the late Professor Wallace C. Sabine of Harvard University. Almost his first step was to establish experimentally the facts that “the duration of audibility of the residual sound is nearly the same in all parts of an auditorium;” that it is “nearly independent of the position of the source;” and that “the efficiency of an absorbent in reducing the duration of the residual sound is, under ordinary circumstances, nearly independent of its position.”1 As his statements imply, Sabine certainly did not expect these principles to hold under all conditions. But since he calculated the reverberation time from the time required for the sound to decay from its initial intensity to the threshold intensity his method could not bring to light the presence of more than one rate of decay, and thus he may not have been aware of this added exception to the idealizations he proposed."
"The motion picture industry has passed through approximately three decades of growth—the first twenty years represented a period of continuous litigation over patent rights and licensing agreements. The next ten years, which would take us up to the entrance of sound pictures, was a period of tremendous expansion and growth unfettered by injunctions or restrictions."
"Last year, at your convention held in Toronto, I had the privilege of outlining to you in some detail the development of the sound film abroad. On that occasion, I tried to give you some approximate idea of what the potentialities of the foreign sound field were on the exhibition side, through a presentation of estimates of the number of theaters wired. I also endeavored to indicate what European producers were doing in the way of sound film production. It is my intention to pursue this thought today, stressing new conditions created by the displacement of silent by sound films, which in my belief are already beginning to create a severer competitive situation for American pictures abroad. And it is my further purpose to outline in a general way what our major film companies are doing, in an endeavor to retain their hold in the non-English speaking markets"
"Throughout the spring and summer of 1930 a gradual increase was noted in the efforts to establish the sound picture as a medium of good entertainment and lift it out of the realm of pure novelty. Many of the problems which faced the director and cameraman have been solved, and it has been possible for them to give more attention to the artistic and dramatic phases of the picture. Installations of unsatisfactory sound equipment made during the past two years in the studios and theaters were rapidly being replaced by standard reliable apparatus."
"The moving picture is a modern industry, not only in being contemporary, but in conducting its business along the most enlightened and up-to-date lines. When the time comes, and it will, that ushers in the next development of the motion picture art, the leaders of our industry will again be prepared to startle and please millions of patrons with added improvement. Instead of being off-guard when sound came, the industry, in a large degree, was acquainted with its findings as well as with its flounderings. The experiments and conclusions of engineers, producers, distributors, and managers form a body of fact which has been of great advantage to all of us."
"The value of the X-rays in the study of medical and surgical problems would be greatly enhanced by the addition of cinematography and, in fact, many medical men impatient with X-ray stills—at best records of single phases only—have begun to ask for new methods of attack along cinematographic lines; in short, for “moving pictures” of the internal organs of the body at work, e. g., the heart beating, the digestive tract dealing with food, and so on."
"This committee was organized in January of this year and a report of the meetings held during the spring was presented at the Washington meeting of the Society in May and appeared in the August, 1930, issue of the Journal. As indicated in that report, the work of this committee may be summarized under the following headings: Preparation of Booklet, Nomenclature, Standard Practice, and Wide Film Dimensions."
"We have had to alter our conception of the application of the non-professional projectors employing 16 mm. film. It was formerly felt, that due to inherent limitations in illumination, these small units could only be recommended for use before a handful of people. However, due to their portability, comparatively low cost, and low film cost, they have become increasingly popular. While one of their major applications is in the home, they have become an important sales aid in the business field and find increasing use in the school classroom."
"A motion picture sensitometer, commonly called a “timer,” is a device for making a series of single picture frame trial exposures through a motion picture negative which exposures correspond to those given by the various steps on the printer. The exposed film is then developed and the correctly exposed picture frame selected by judgment. The exposure which this frame received indicates the correct exposure to be used in the printer."
"An analysis of the requirements for maximum efficiency in 16 mm. projection reveals a number of interesting problems. As we are here considering an instniment suitable for business, educational, and entertainment purposes and not merely a plaything for amateur chemists, satisfactory projection must give a good account of itself with respect to the following major operating factors, viz., illumination, good projection, and ease of operation."
"The two characteristics of the thermionic amplifier tube which have given it unique supremacy over any other amplifying device have been its ability, first, to amplify signals without appreciable distortion, and, second, to amplify signals without requiring any appreciable energy from the signal source. The latter feature is due to the ability of the grid to control the flow of electron current from the filament to the plate without taking any material current itself. When the grid potential is more negative than that of the filament, no electron current flows into the grid, but when the grid potential is positive, part of the electron stream enters the grid. Consequently, in order that no appreciable energy shall be consumed in the grid circuit, amplifier tubes have usually been operated with their grids more negative than the filaments."
"In the photographic reproduction of sound there are unavoidable losses related to the speed with which the film is moved. For high quality reproduction, these losses must be reduced to within tolerable limits. In the first place, it is not possible to lay down on the sound track a line of light which is infinitely narrow. Furthermore, it is difficult to adjust the line of light so that it is normal to the direction of travel of the film. The first of these losses results from what may be called the image width effect and the second the azimuth effect. The following discussion chiefly concerns the variable density method. It also applies to the variable area method so far as the image width effect is concerned, but does not apply strictly as regards the azimuth effect."
"The working principle underlying the two-color process known as Koduchrome is the use of a tanning bleach for treatment of the duplicate negative, which removes the negative image and differentially tans the area where the image existed. When the film is treated subsequently with dyes capable of dyeing soft gelatin, a positive dye image is produced.1"
"The successful operation of a motion picture laboratory depends very largely on its ability to produce prints of uniformly good quality. Such prints can be produced only by maintaining constant the various factors which control the exposure and degree of development of the image, and of these the developing power of the developing solution is, perhaps, the most dacult to control."
"Having been requested by the Papers Committee to report to the Society on any new apparatus placed on the market by our company during the past year, I shall give you in as few words as possible a description of two pieces of equipment recently developed which are now replacing a great deal of the older equipment installed. These two units are the Super Simplex mechanism and the new rear shutter assembly for the old type Simplex mechanism."
"A recorder embodying certain new principles in its design and operation has recently been adopted by RCA Photophone, Inc. It is designated as Type PR-4. The optical system has been redesigned and a number of improvements made, especially in the direction of providing better facilities for adjustment. The sound record produced is of the variable area type which has been used from the beginning by this company, and which has given excellent results. It is, however, in the means employed for providing uniform movement of the film past the point where the recording is done, that the new recorder differs most radically from its predecessors."
"Practically any mechanism used for moving film intermittently in motion picture apparatus can be run at a speed a great deal higher than the normal operating speed of intermittent printers without damage to the film. The time occupied for the actual movement of the film in an intermittent printer is time lost, of course, from the useful part of the shutter cycle; that is, during the movement of the film there can be no exposure. It would be advantageous, then, if the shutter cycle could be reapportioned, allowing more time in the useful part of the cycle by speeding up within the permissible limits the movement of the film."
"The cleaning and processing units discussed in this paper have been demonstrated at a previous Society meeting, and a detailed description of the various cleaning processes at this time would be merely repetition. This paper will therefore treat only of the improvements effected in these units which contribute to a marked increase in operating efficiency."
"“Brownian movement” is the term applied to the peculiar spontaneous movement which is inherent with small particles in suspension in a fluid or colloidal solution. Without digressing to give any further explanation regarding this phenomenon, let us consider a specific example of research work which necessitated taking motion pictures of such particles."
"One of the questions confronting a photographer which must be answered each time before he starts taking is “What exposure is to be given?” This question must be answered so frequently in actual motion picture work that a quick and easy method is needed to give the answer. The experienced photographer is fortunate, for he is able to judge the best exposure after inspection of the subject or its image on the ground glass of the camera. Persons with the ability to do this, in most cases, are not interested in other methods, and this paper is not for them. The man, however, whose subjects vary from insects to studio sets may find that it takes a long while to gain the ability to judge exposure by inspection. Moreover, the accuracy of the exposure determination needed varies greatly from time to time. The man, who either is inexperienced in photography or is working in some field new to him, must seek to determine his exposure. For work in the field with daylight illumination an actinometer may be useful, but it is of little value in the studio. Various optical methods may be useful in the studio including the use of a photo-electric cell for measuring the total illumination reflected toward the camera. Their chief qualification is often the speed of the determination. They may not be practical under all conditions since the range of any one instrument is usually limited. The exposure value must allow for the degree of the close-up, all the way up to the high magnifications obtained with a microscope. The range of illumination included between that used for the cinematography of growing plants and that required for some miniature work is enormous. Moreover, it may not always be satisfactory to use the value of illumination obtained by integration of the whole field. The background may form a large fraction of the area, and yet its rendering may be unimportant."
"When series are generators were introduced and used successfully in theaters, the projection requirements were relatively simple. The projection room equipment usually consisted of two projectors with vertical carbon lamps with the addition in some instances of a spot lamp requiring the same amount of current as the projectors. Arc controls first introduced and used were mostly of the intermittent type using a voltage relay, the coil of which is connected across the arc, in connection with an operating motor. The operation of these lamps was successful with the series arc generators, and as no ballast resistance was used in the projection arc circuit a maximum converting efficiency from alternating current supply to direct current for the lamps was obtained."
"There has been a long-felt want in the whole photographic field for an exposure meter that is fundamentally a scientific instrument, but one which has been refined to the point of practicality in the field, for the cinematographer or photographer-in other words, an instrument designed in accordance with scientific knowledge of light measurement, but one of simple operation and compact design."
"Shortly after the organization of the committee, early in 1929, two meetings were held at which the program of the committee was discussed at considerable length and definite steps were taken to obtain answers to some of the questions involved."
"The demand for motion pictures in color which began in the summer of 1929 continues without abatement. It is reported that some of the larger producers would willingly change back to the black and white pictures but say that the demand for color pictures by the public is so insistent that they do not dare to change. The reason for such statements is based on the fact that the cost for color prints is such a great item."
"Since the last report of the committee, contact has been established with the Screen Illumination Committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The chairman of the Academy committee, Mr. Huse, is also a member of the Theater Lighting Committee. Several conferences were held between Messrs. Huse and Parnham during the latter's visit to the coast this spring, to coordinate the common activities of the two committees."
"The standards in this section apply to: transformers (Exclusive of instrument transformers, auto transformers used as part of auto starters, rectifiers, special testing, series street lighting, sign lighting, ignition, and radio transformers and all small transformers used for special purposes.) Standards for instrument transformers and for constant-current transformers are the subjects of separate sections, voltage regulators (Exclusive of devices for controlling the voltage of generators) and reactors."
"The following Standards cover switchboards and switching equipment not specifically covered elsewhere as apparatus. These Standards do not apply to industrial control equipment or communication switchboards and switching equipment."
"This Section of the A. I. E. E. Standards, \"Insulator Tests\" is a revision of a former A. I. E. E. Standard No. 41, entitled \"Insulator Test Specifications\". The work of revision was handled by a Sectional Committee organized under the procedure of the American Standards Association. It has received approval as an American Standard through presentation to the American Standards Association under the joint sponsorship of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association."
