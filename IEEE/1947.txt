"A review of the radar duplexer and receiver, as developed during the war, is presented. Attention is devoted to the principles of operation and typical circuit arrangements employed in the duplexer, the crystal converter, the local-oscillator injection circuits, the intermediate-frequency amplifier, and the automatic-tuning unit. Emphasis is placed on methods found advantageous in the 1-centimeter and 3-centimeter wavelength regions. The interrelation between the various receiver components in determining the over-all receiver noise figure is shown analytically, and typical performance numbers are given."
"The attenuation of 1.25-centimeter radiation by rain was determined experimentally. The experimental setup consisted of an optical path of 6400 feet with nine equally spaced rain gauges. The techniques used made it possible to utilize both uniform and nonuniform rainfall rates. Drop-size measurements were also made but no conclusions could be drawn because of the wide scatter in the drop-size distributions obtained. If the maximum distance over which communication can normally be established is 100 miles, light to moderate rain will reduce the range to about 10 miles. The radiated power must be increased by 1020in order to re-establish communication over the 100-mile path."
"A new circle diagram is presented for systems having an isolated single resonant mode, in addition to frequency-insensitive structures of arbitrary complexities, and ending in an outgoing wave guide or other transmission line. The diagram is obtained from standing-wave measurements in the outgoing line performed at three or more frequencies near resonance. The diagram permits the mapping, in the complex plane of load impedances or reflection coefficients, of such contour lines as loaded-resonator Q, frequency pulling, and the circuit efficiency when the resonator is electronically excited. The proof of these relations, as given in Part II (to be published in a subsequent issue), rests on field theory and establishes in effect the use of general circuit methods in the realm of microwave applications."
"The donutron is an all-metal squirrel-cage magnetron. It is a multisegment magnetron with a single resonant structure. It is tuned by the relative axial displacement of alternate anode segments, through flexure of one wall of the cavity in which the anode structure is supported. During the testing of some sixty models, the operating efficiency and the output power have been increased to 40 to 50 per cent and around 50 watts, respectively (6- to 12-centimeter range). The best model to date tunes over a 1.5 to 1 ratio with power flat to 3 decibels. A single value of voltage and magnetic field is adequate for the entire tuning range. Of the various modes of operation, two are important, a long-wave tunable cavity mode and a shortwave resonant re-entrant-line mode. The former can be entirely suppressed and the latter enhanced by a special phase-reversing anode. In the line mode the highest output powers have been observed. In cold tests, modes around 4 centimeters as well as indication of even shorter resonance wavelengths have been found. A wide range of design parameters has been studied. Rieke diagrams have been taken for the best tubes."
"In the conventional power tetrode, when operating within the normal range of electrode voltages, changes in plate potential do not appreciably affect the total space current or its division at the grid plane. Furthermore, changes in grid potential, although affecting to a large degree the magnitude of the space current reaching the screen plane, do not alter materially the division of this current between screen and plate. Making use of these facts, and taking into account the effect of initial velocities of emission and contact potential, each electrode current can be expressed in terms of the 3/2 power of an equivalent voltage and an empirical function. These empirical functions can be plotted on a log-log chart in a manner that allows the complete static curve data to be easily determined for any grid, screen, and plate voltage within the normal operating range. Methods of determining experimentally the empirical functions at low power levels are described. A sample log-log chart and an explanation of its use are presented."

"Of recent years, an active debate has been carried on relative to the justification of work in the field of \"pure science\" as opposed to the desirability of endeavor in the domain of \"applied technology.\" One group of thinkers has felt that the pursuit of truth for its own sake was not only more satisfying intellectually and more stimulating to the dignity of the investigator but also, in the long run, more likely to benefit science, engineering, and society through the discovery of basic facts susceptible of many later useful applications. Other thinkers have insisted that \"pure science\" was nothing more than a meaningless exploration in a social and economic vacuum, and that it constituted a sort of cloistered and self-indulgent scientific \"doodling\" by the research worker and was thus unworthy of encouragement. Society, these thinkers proclaim, is entitled to ask the expensively trained investigator, using costly facilities and the help of his fellow workers, to produce results markedly slanted toward practically immediate and major social benefit. As correlative disputes, there have been argued such questions as the following. Should research be institutionally subsidized by government? Should the engineer enter the political and industrial-management arenas to preside, at least in part, over the social destinies of his mental products? Can and should a research or development worker become an industrial leader or a political figure of prominence? And so the conflicts rage. It is accordingly interesting to bring one viewpoint to our readers in the following forceful Guest Editorial by a leading engineer who is chairman of the Institute's Papers Procurement Committee and also vice-president of the Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corporation."
"This paper describes a method for obtaining an engineering solution for integrodifferential equations of physical systems using an electronic system. The components consist of standard plug-in feed-back amplifier units. As the interconnections are wires, resistors, and capacitors, no complicated mechanical layout problem is involved and a generally flexible analyzer need not be set up, for it is a simple matter to assemble the particular circuit for any system of equations for which solutions are desired. The system should, therefore, be of interest to those involved in a study of the dynamics of physical systems."
"The data on the transmission of 10- and 3-centimeter waves in low-level ocean ducts obtained by the Naval Research Laboratory expedition to Antigua, British West Indies, were analyzed by wave theory. The analysis was made for a distribution of modified index of refraction with height (shown by curve C′ in Fig. 1). Below the horizon, the 10-centimeter wave was found to propagate by the first normal mode with a theoretical decrement of 1 decibel per nautical mile, as against an observed value of about 0.8 decibel per nautical mile in the first 80 miles from transmitter. Theory vezified the observed constancy of decrement with height for this wavelength. Beyond 80 miles the observed rate of attenuation dropped to a low value of 0.2 decibel per nautical mile. This change of slope in the intensity curve is probably due to the emergence of scattered radiation after the direct diffracted beam had been depleted. With the exception of one point there is quantitative agreement between the observed and theoretical distribution of intensity with height (see Fig. 9) for the 10-centimeter wave. The 3-centimeter wave was found to propagate below the horizon by the first and second modes, with theoretical decrements of zero and 0.5 decibel per nautical mile, respectively. The latter agrees with the observed values at high elevations, but near the surface, where theoretically attenuation should be negligible, the observed rate of attenuation exceeds the theoretical value by about 0.3 decibel per nautical mile."
"Some practical aspects of microwave oscillators using disk-seal tubes are discussed. Typical design and performance data are given. A general small-signal oscillator theory is presented and applied to the re-entrant disk-seal-tube microwave oscillator. It is shown how information on frequency of oscillation, tuning, and frequency stability can be obtained."
"This paper describes briefly a number of radiating elements which have proved useful in the design of high- and low-gain omnidirectional antennas at wavelengths of 3 and 10 centimeters."
"A quantitative presentation is made of the data from a large number of tests on three types of gaseous voltage-regulator tubes, VR75, VR105, and VR150, from several manufacturers. The effect of several factors, such as time and temperature, on the voltage stability has been investigated, and an equivalent circuit of the tube was experimentally determined. These results are especially applicable where the VR tubes are used as a source of reference voltage, such as in a degenerative electronic voltage stabilizer."

"A derivation of the formulas available for the measurement of terminal impedances on transmission lines is given in terms of hyperbolic functions. The accuracy and usefulness of a number of different methods are considered. Results are obtained in a form suitable for convenient application to practical measuring problems involving standing-wave and resonance-curve methods."
"Possible methods of microwave power measurement are reviewed. The design requirements for bolometric wattmeters are outlined, and examples are given of bolometer elements that have been developed to meet these requirements. A recently developed bolometer element that may be used over an exceedingly wide band of frequencies is included. The results of experiments to investigate sources of error and to determine the accuracy of these wattmeters are summarized. These experiments indicate that, although serious errors are possible, proper usage will hold errors to within a few per cent."
"Design formulas and charts for the choice of inductances, Q's, and coupling coefficients of loop-antenna coupling transformers are given on the basis of signal-to-noise characteristics. A method of determining these values when a cable or other primary capacitance is present is also given."
"A new method of carrying on flying-boat hull design involves radio control of free-flight models. The scale factors of the models are such that severe weight and space limitations are imposed on the radio-control equipment, considering the complexity of control. Seven independent channels capable of simultaneous operation are needed. Five accomplish proportional positioning and two perform switching operations. A single radio-frequency carrier is used, amplitude-modulated by seven control tones. The factors affecting the positioning accuracy are discussed. A compensating circuit is described which corrects for variations in receiver output with charges of battery voltage and distance from the control station. Over-all positioning accuracy is plus or minus 4 per cent. Operating experience includes nearly 1000 test runs utilizing scale models of three different types of flying boats."

"For better or worse, a very large proportion of the technical radio terms used in all countries are taken directly from English or else translated literally from that language. The author presents a plead for some measure of agreement on the use of new words for describing new things. He cites as an example 'radar,' which an official United States publication notes has a radio echo inherent in all radar systems. But the word 'radar' is already being used here (under protest from some) to describe devices that make use of a triggered response instead of a natural echo. More loosely, it is beginning to be applied to any new radio positionfinding system. This is not just a plea for pedantic accuracy, and still less a diatribe against mere inelegance in radio terminology. It is a matter of more than domestic or even Anglo-American concern. We who share the English language have a world-wide responsibility towards other users of our radio jargon. At a time when the language of radio is, through its electronic off-shoots, encroaching on so many fields of human endeavor, it is worth while to take some pains to avoid ambiguity and confusion."
"The electronic devices used most extensively, recently, for the generation of centimeter waves are discussed. The physical form, operating capabilities, and the basic physical principles of operation of the triode, velocity-variation, and magnetron oscillators are presented. An attempt is made to show how these oscillators are related to one another. For a variety of reasons, particular emphasis is placed on the magnetron oscillator."
"A method of demodulation is proposed in which the output current of the demodulator is a linear function of the input voltage, while at the same time provision is made for producing the necessary product terms which will result in demodulation. Demodulation is brought about by integrating the product of the instantaneous value of the modulated wave by the instantaneous value of a wave having the same frequency and phase as the carrier. Where this method of demodulation is used it is proposed that two carriers in quadrature on the same frequency may be employed, reducing the bandwidth to that required for single-sideband transmission. It is suggested that the required linear demodulation characteristics may be obtained through the use of \"electron-coupled\" demodulators. Theoretical considerations indicate that, when demodulation of this type is employed, selectivity ahead of the demodulator may be dispensed with, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved, greater economy of spectrum space is obtained, the number of tubes required is materially reduced through the use of a common intermediatefrequency amplifier for a number of channels, and any impairment due to the instability of the carrier or oscillator frequency is reduced. As an example of the possible application of the principles outlined, a hypothetical eight-channel transmission system is described."
"General expressions are derived for the input admittance, conductance, and susceptance of a cathode-follower amplifier, and curves are given that show the effect of frequency and circuit parameters upon the input conductance and the effective input capacitance for typical values of plate resistance, transconductance, and interelectrode capacitances. The analysis shows that a capacitance shunting the load resistance of a cathode-follower amplifier may result in a negative input conductance. If the load capacitance is of the order of magnitude of the interelectrode capacitance or greater, this negative conductance is of the order of 5 × 10-4mho at frequencies at which ωCgkis of the order of 2 × 10-3mho and above. For typical values of Cgkthis value of ωCgkcorresponds to frequencies of the order of 50 megacycles and above. Negative conductance of this magnitude may readily cause oscillations in the input circuit unless preventive measures are taken. A number of such measures are discussed."
"An exponential transmission line is useful for impedance transformations over a wide band of radio frequencies. It is shown that a four-wire line of the \"side-connected\" type employing uniform conductors, and in which the rates of taper change only once along the line, may be designed to approximate closely to an exponential line. Design equations and charts are given which aid in determining the wire sizes, values of taper, and change in taper for building some of these transformers."

"The making of ultraspeed radiographs using exposure times of the order of one-millionth of a second requires the passage of electron currents approaching 1000 amperes. Such currents are supplied by an electron source utilizing field emission from a cold-cathode electrode which degenerates into a metallic arc in a high vacuum. The recording of such high-speed transients is briefly reviewed. The development of this equipment has been greatly accelerated because of the war. Illustrations showing its applications to various radiographic problems requiring short exposure times which have recently been released by the War Department are included; among these are radiographs taken at Frankford Arsenal and Aberdeen Proving Grounds of exploding shells and bombs, and at Princeton University showing the wounding mechanism of high-velocity fragments."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a quick, complete, and exact method of design and analysis of double- and triple-tuned band-pass amplifiers. The necessary small-percentage pass-band equations are derived giving the relationship between the circuit characteristics and the response characteristics. These circuit characteristics are: the resonant frequency f0, coefficient of coupling K, the circuit Q, and the input and output capacitances Cin, and Cout. The response characteristics are: the percentage bandwidth between peaks Δfp/f0, the peak-to-valley response ratio within the pass band VpI/Vv, the peak-to-\"skirt\" response ratio Vp/V at different skirt-to-peak bandwidth ratio points Δf/Δfpoutside the pass band, the circuit gain at the peaks, and the phase shift θ at any frequency. These design equations, extended to the case of one to eight cascaded stages, are incorporated in two sets of conveniently used nomographs, one for double-tuned circuits and one for triple-tuned circuits. Specific examples of the use of these nomographs are given."

"General formulas for the effect of electron beams on resonant systems in terms of frequency shift and change in Q are derived from the point of view of lumped circuits and from a general electromagnetic field standpoint. A way of introducing the electrons has been found which materially enhances their effectiveness in producing a shift of frequency in a resonant system. Measurements of the frequency shift produced by such an electron beam in a typical geometry were made which check well with values calculated from the general theory. Possible amplitude and phase distortions are calculated when such a beam is used to frequency-modulate a system, and these are found to be negligibly small, even for very high modulating frequencies. It is shown that this method of frequency control is ideally suited for frequency modulation or automatic frequency stabilization of continuous-wave magnetron oscillators using negative-grid-controlled electron beams for controlling the frequency of oscillations."
"This paper is based on a wartime requirement for a 25-watt, 4000-megacycle continuous-wave oscillator capable of electronic frequency modulation with a deviation of at least 2.5 megacycles. A satisfactory solution was found in the addition of frequency control to a continuous-wave magnetron by the introduction of electron beams into the magnetron cavities in a manner described by Smith and Shulman. This method is referred to as \"spiral-beam\" control. A brief account is given of the method of designing a continuouswave magnetron for the specified power and frequency. The problem of adding spiral-beam frequency control to this magnetron is considered in detail, and a procedure is presented for obtaining the optimum design consistent with negligible amplitude modulation and reasonable cathode-current densities. The unusual features of construction of this magnetron are described, including a method of mechanical tuning and the method of adding grid-controlled beams for frequency modulation. Performance data on the continuous-wave magnetron over a wide range of operating conditions indicate that the required 25 watts output can be attained at 850 volts with 50 per cent efficiency. Experimental results on \"spiral-beam\" frequency control demonstrate that the required 2.5-megacycle frequency deviation with no amplitude modulation can be achieved by electron beams introduced into two out of twelve cavities. A deviation of 4 megacycles is attained under conditions allowing some amplitude modulation. Still greater deviation is predicted by using more beams."
"The method of Smith and Shulman has been used for the frequency modulation of a 1-kilowatt continuous-wave magnetron. This tube is of the \"vane\" type, having twelve resonant cavities, and it is mechanically tunable over a range from about 720 to 900 megacycles by a cylindrical element which varies the interstrap capacitance. At the applied magnetic field required for frequency modulation without change in amplitude, 1 kilowatt output at 900 megacycles is obtained with an anode voltage of 2.5 kilovolts and an efficiency of about 55 per cent; the efficiency rises with decreasing frequency or with increasing magnetic field. At 900 megacycles, electron beams in nine of the magnetron resonant cavities give a frequency deviation of 3.5 megacycles (a total frequency swing of 7 megacycles) at an output of 1 kilowatt, rising to 4 megacycles at an output of 750 watts. The frequency deviation is reduced when the tube is tuned to lower frequencies. The modulator power required would be very low, since the grid-cathode capacitance of the frequency-modulation guns is small and the grids draw no current. It would be practicable to increase the frequency deviation of this tube by about 15 per cent through an increase in beam current, and by an additional 20 per cent through the use of eleven beams. A change in the type of beam cathode would effect an even greater deviation."
"Continuous recordings of field strength on 474 and 2800 megacycles, over a period of 13 months, revealed maximum values three to four times the free-space field at distances of 42.5 and 70.1 miles from the transmitting site atop the Empire State Building, New York City. Recordings on 45.1 megacycles during the same period, on a reduced schedule, did not exhibit the large variation found on the higher frequencies. Refraction was found to be greater in the summertime, the strongest periods occurring at night or in the early morning. Refraction greater than normal was not evident when the average wind velocity was above 13 miles per hour. A study of weather conditions during the periods of strongest refraction indicated that roughly 60 per cent of the gradients were of the frontal type, involving different air masses, and approximately 60 per cent of the gradients were higher than 100 feet above the earth's surface."
"The frequency spectrum produced by single-tone, two-tone, and multitone modulating signals in the case of amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and combined amplitude and frequency modulation are studied in turn. Amplitude, symmetry, and energy of sidebands for the different cases are considered. Extensive computations are made of frequency spectrums, and these are compared with actual frequency spectrums observed by means of a spectrum analyzer. The agreement between computed and measured frequency spectrums is very close."

"Part I discusses the general theory underlying the operation of radar beacons. The various components of a typical beacon, such as the receiver, discriminator, blanking gate, coder, modulator-driver, modulator, transmitter, stabilizing tuner, antenna, and monitor, are discussed in some detail. System considerations, such as the comparison of primary and secondary radar systems, delay in the beacon, factors governing the choice of beacon transmitter and receiver frequencies, system accuracy, duty cycle and traffic-handling capacity, and siting and range, are discussed. Part II considers the application of the radar beacon to identification, air and ground-controlled general navigation, air and ground-controlled precision navigation, collision warning, emergency rescue, field-strength measurement, and airport-approach control."
"The purpose and general nature of the receiving pattern are discussed. The results of calculations for the resistance and reactance of wide-angle cone antennas in free space are given. Several cone antennas in hemispherical enclosures have been measured and the impedance and phase-angle curves are shown. These results indicate that cylinders are more desirable than cones; therefore, two cylindrical antennas in hemispheres are tested. The results of investigation show that by making the antenna more slender and providing fine tips: (a) the radiation resistance is increased, (b) the rate of change of phase angle at resonance is increased, and (c) the resonant frequency is lowered."
"The plotting device described here serves as a computer for the angular position of load points in the Smith Chart for microwaves. By means of a simple mechanical arrangement the computation from measured standing-wave patterns is considerably expedited. The accuracy does not fall off as the distance from generator to probe increases, and in many such cases may considerably exceed that attainable with a slide rule. The gadget should prove useful where reflection measurements at variable frequency are repeatedly required as, for instance, in Q-circle and other resonance measurements."

"The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), the first electronic computing machine to be built, is a very large device (containing 18,000 vacuum tubes) compounded out of a few basic types of computing circuits. The design principles that were followed in order to insure reliable operation of the electronic computer are presented, and the basic types of computing circuits are analyzed. Most of the design work on component circuits was devoted to constructing reliable memory circuits (flip-flops) and adding circuits (counters). These are treated in detail. The ENIAC performs the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square-rooting, and the looking up of function values automatically. The units which perform these operations, the units which take numerical data into and out of the machine, and those which control the over-all operation are described. The technique of combining the basic electronic circuits to perform these functions is illustrated by three typical computing circuits: the addition circuit, a programming circuit, and the multiplication circuit."
"A method for the automatic frequency control of any type of tunable microwave oscillator is described. In this method a servomechanism is used which includes a wave-guide discriminator circuit, a mercury-contact relay, a 60-cycle amplifier, and a small two-phase induction motor. Tests made on a preliminary model of a circuit of this type used with a 4000-megacycle oscillator showed that a stability of 1 part in 50,000 was obtainable. The manner in which such a control system may be used in a microwave repeater is described."
"Two methods are presented for calculating the ideal performance of amplitude-variation-type harmonic amplifiers: (1), a slightly revised form of Terman's analysis, which is convenient for quickly obtaining approximate results, and (2), a graphical analysis which, while somewhat less rapid, is exact. In a frequency-multiplier stage the actual performance may come short of the ideal because of degenerative effects due to grid-plate capacitance and cathode inductance. In many cases, with power tubes, these degenerative effects are so great as to render the stage impracticable. The degeneration due to grid-plate capacitance may be thought of as an output loading effect which is proportional to the mutual conductance and the grid-plate capacitance of the tube and inversely proportional to the total capacitance in the circuit between the grid and the cathode. Inductance in the cathode circuit common to both grid and plate circuits has a loading effect on both input and output circuits which is proportional to the mutual conductance of the tube, the common inductance, the internal capacitance between the cathode and the input or output electrode as the case may be, and to the second power of the frequency. Circuit arrangements for overcoming these degenerative effects are discussed in theory and application."
"Trajectory equations are developed for accelerated electrons which enter a retarding, axially symmetric electrostatic field with a quadratic axial potential distribution. Neglecting space-charge effects of the electrons, such a field can be produced between two charged electrodes consisting of a cone and a hyperboloid. A focus criterion is established, and under these conditions the permissible angles of divergence and convergence which an incident electron may have and still be focused back through the entering aperture are determined. An equation for the transit time of the axial electrons in the reflector is derived. By proper adjustment of dimensions and voltages, various simple electrode shapes may be made to give an axial potential distribution which is nearly quadratic, and thus give comparable performances as electron reflectors."
"Equations and curves giving cutoff frequency and impedance are presented for rectangular wave guide having a rectangular ridge projecting inward from one or both sides. It is shown that ridge wave guide has a lower cutoff frequency and impedance and greater higher-mode separation than a plain rectangular wave guide of the same width and height. The cutoff frequency equation is fairly accurate for any practical cross section. The impedance equation is strictly accurate only for an extremely thin cross section. Values found by the use of this equation have, however, been found to check experimental values very closely. A number of uses for this type of wave guide are suggested."
"By local heating to temperatures below 573 degrees centigrade, localized twinning is easily produced in AT-CT-, and GT-cut quartz plates. This twinning is of the electrical or Dauphine type. Such twinning may result from manufacturing operations, but may be prevented."

"This paper investigates some basic principles in the operation of systems for magnetic deflection of television tubes. In the first part, the energy of the deflecting field is calculated for various deflection angles and beam voltages. It is found that sweep amplifiers are preferably operated with a positive rate of change of plate current. This causes a considerable plate-voltage drop, for which expressions are given. The efficiency of sweep generators is discussed and a method is indicated to determine the power dissipation in the sweep output amplifier. The second part deals with the transients during the retrace and their elimination. A theory is given for resistance damping. Practical results are presented for a special method of damping by secondary emission within the sweep amplifier. In part three, some basic forms of sweep distortion are discussed and means for their correction are indicated. Two characteristic distortions are found to be due to the resistive components of either the tube or the load. These distortions are of opposite sign. Nonlinearity of the tube characteristic is found equivalent to an emphasis of low-frequency components in the spectrum of a sawtooth wave. The fourth part describes a sweep circuit of improved efficiency. This circuit operates with power feedback and uses a diode as switching element. Flyback energy is rectified and the resulting direct-current power added to the plate power supply."
"An instrument which indicates the frequencies of the components in a periodic complex electrical waveform is described. The frequencies are displayed on four parallel linear scales on a cathode-ray tube. The scales can be set up, without frequency calibration and with an accuracy of 3 per cent, from design equations developed in this paper. The range of indication is from 1 cycle to 1 kilocycle per second. The performance is described, and limitations on the rate of sweeping the frequency bands and the effects of transients are discussed."
"A design is described for a broad-band coaxial water load suitable for use in ultra-high-frequency calorimeter wattmeters. The load utilizes a water-filled coaxial line as an attenuating section. The low input impedance of this line is matched to the standard transmission-cable impedance in a broadband matching section using a tapered dielectric composed of titanium dioxide. Several requirements influenced the design: the needs for broadband impedance characteristics, sturdy construction, small physical size, and for the ability to measure low powers quickly, being of prime importance. As a practical illustration, a brief description is given of a unit designed to operate in the 1000- to 3000-megacycle frequency ranges and the 5- to 150-watt power range."
"Six charts are given which may be used for designing cylindrical resonant cavities whose cross sections are circles, concentric circles, squares, or rectangles. A new method of representing multiple-resonance phenomena is used, to which the name \"mode lattice\" has been given. The mode lattice is an alignment chart which relates the size and shape of a cavity with resonant wavelength for a large number of modes. Points distributed on a lattice represent the modes. The equations involved, the method of use, and the special advantages of each chart are described, together with the method of construction. A set of equations has been derived for calculating the effect of small changes in dimensions or wavelength for resonators of all the above shapes."

"During 1945 and 1946 a completé sequential television system was constructed and tested. This was followed by the development of a simultaneous system, compatible with the present commercial monochrome television. This paper is the introduction to a group of two papers which describe the transmitting and receiving apparatus used in the simultaneous system."
"The technical development of the present flying-spot-type color-television pickup equipment is described. The use of a high-voltage kinescope with a short persistence phosphor, of the multiplier-type photo-tubes and dichroic filters, permit the construction of apparatus for flying-spot scanning of color slides and color motion picture film providing excellent color video signals. The circuit equalization for the phosphor persistence is described in detail. The use of the simple flying-spot scanner for studio pickup is described."
"Two possible types of transmission, the three-carrier system and subcarrier system, are outlined. Radio-frequency and intermediate-frequency receiving equipment is discussed for both systems. Several reproducing devices and the associated deflecting and video equipment for the trinoscope are described. The solutions of some problems encountered in registration are set forth."
"A new noise source consisting of a gas tube in a transverse magnetic field has been developed. Characteristics of the noise source are presented, together with some consideration of the problems in the amplification of noise. Typical noise-amplifier circuits are given for frequency bandwidths from 0.1 to 2.5 and 5 megacycles, respectively."
"A method is presented for calculating the ability of a communication system to transmit speech intelligibly in the presence of noise. The total speech arriving at the ear of a listener is determined by adding the orthotelephonic gain of the system to the speech spectrum which would be produced by a talker at the eardrum of a listener at a distance of 1 meter. The total noise arriving at the ear is determined in terms of its spectrum level from measurements of the noise pickup of the microphone and the acoustic attenuation of the earphone cushions. The area lying between the spectrum level of the peaks of the speech and the spectrum level of the total noise arrving at the eardrum when plotted on a distorted frequency scale determines a quantity called articulation index which can be correlated with articulation scores. Methods for determining the maximum gain permissible in the system are discussed. The validity of the method is established by comparison of calculated with carefully measured articulation scores."
"One-way radio propagation measurements on 9 and 3 centimeters between ship and shore, coupled with meteorological measurements on ship and ashore, were made in the Atlantic tradewind area off the east coast of Antigua, British West Indies, early in 1945. Persistent low-level ducts, averaging 20 to 50 feet in height, with an effective strength of 5 to 10 M units, were found to exist all the time. The height and strength of the duct appears to depend on the wind speed, low winds producing low ducts of moderate strength while higher winds result in higher but weaker ducts. Various antenna-height combinations were explored to determine the optimum heights for utilization of the duct. Very effective trapping was found on 3 centimeters, the optimum height being between 6 and 15 feet, depending on duct conditions. On 9 centimeters the degree of trapping was only partial, and the strongest signals were obtained with the highest heights available (46 feet transmitting and 94 feet receiving). Rates of decrease of signal averaged 0.85 decibel per nautical mile on 9 centimeters up to about 80 miles, and 0.45 decibel per nautical mile on 3 centimeters, for all ranges. Beyond 80 miles the rate of decrease of signal on 9 centimeters was much less, about 0.2 decibel per nautical mile. Rain squalls had no observable effect on the strength of received signals."
"This paper discusses the factors that must be considered in the design of an S-type noncontacting plunger, which will present an effective short circuit to the TEM-mode in a circular coaxial line over a frequency tuning ratio of 3 to 1 or more Since there are no sliding contacts, a coaxial resonator may be tuned an unlimited number of times with this type of plunger and still remain free from physical wear, \"finger noise,\" and mechanical hysteresis and drag. It was the use of this type of plunger that made possible the development of local oscillators which can be tuned an unlimited number of times over a microwave frequency range as great as 2 to 1. Subsequent Parts II and III of this paper will deal with the analysis and methods of controlling the parasitic resonances which may occur in a noncontacting plunger when the operating wavelength is less than the circumference of the outer coaxial line."
"A mathematical analysis of the mechanism utilized by the microwave reflex oscillator in producing high-frequency oscillations from a direct-current beam of electrons is presented. A simplified small-signal theory is postulated in which the electrodes are assumed to be ideal parallel planes and the electron motion is rectilinear, uninfluenced by space charge. The finite transit time of the electrons in traversing the modulator gap is taken into consideration. From this theory are derived expressions for the velocity modulation and the resultant current-density modulation of the beam by action of a retarding field. An equation is derived for the fundamental-frequency component of the current induced in the tank circuit. The necessary conditions for the self-starting of oscillations are determined, and the minimum starting current is given as a function of the tank-circuit characteristics and the optimum transit-angle values. Equations are derived for the rate of change of oscillating frequency with reflector voltage and beam voltage. To determine the amount of electronic tuning possible, calculations are made of the range over which the reflector voltage can be varied for a particular mode and oscillations maintained. An efficiency curve is given for the conversion of beam-current power to high-frequency power, and optimum efficiencies are calculated for conditions in which the amplitude of oscillation is small. Efficiency curves are also presented for the case of large amplitudes when the transit angle of the modulator gap is negligibly small."
"A wave-guide-to-coaxial-line junction having a better than 2-to-1 bandwidth with less than 2-to-1 voltage-standing-wave ratio was required in the design of microwave filters and receiver transmission systems. Several types of junctions satisfying these requirements were designed using simple transmission-line theory. One type designed for a standard wave-guide cross section has a bandwidth ratio of 2.7 to 1. The design method is presented in this report with a detailed description of a number of particular junctions. Some of these models are for use with very thin wave guide, which is ideally suited for wave-guide filters; some for use with the more usual rectangular cross sections; and one for use with ridge (\"loaded\") wave guide. The latter junction is capable of at least a 6-to-1 bandwidth."

"Proposed, is a method of rating microphones and loudspeakers whereby the over-all performance of a sound system may be determined by adding together the microphone and loudspeaker ratings and the gain of the interconnecting network. This sum gives the performance quite accurately for most systems. However, in some combinations of elements correction terms must be added. The formulas for these correction terms are derived. The proposed microphone and loudspeaker ratings have the additional usefulness of being in a form which permits the comparison of instruments of different impedances."
"In order to obtain the maximum benefits from the frequency-modulation system of broadcasting, it is necessary to give special attention to the selectivity and symmetry of the receiver intermediate-frequency-amplifier channel. Voltage feedbacks must be reduced to a minimum in order to obtain good results in mass production without resorting to some sort of stagger tuning. Selectivity and stability formulas, stabilizing methods, and methods of aligning double-tuned transformers are discussed."
"The limitations of the usual types of standard-signal generators are discussed and alternative generating schemes applicable to frequency measurements in the microwave region are analyzed. A secondary frequency standard is described which nakes use of a multiplier chain based on a stabilized quartz-crystal oscillator. The voltages at different frequencies are summed and applied to a silicon-crystal harmonic generator. It is pointed out that the silicon crystal is an excellent nonlinear element for the generation of harmonics in the microwave range. The result is an extremely wide output-frequency spectrum. In the particular frequency standard described, frequencies are generated to at least 10,000 megacycles. Identification of the harmonic frequencies is by means of a coaxial-line-type wavemeter, and detection is by means of a super-heterodyne detector. The standard has been successfully employed in the microwave range, being no more difficult to use than the conventional secondary standards used for frequencies below 50 megacycles."
"The function that determines signal-to-noise ratio is calculated for loop-coupling transformers. It is shown that the optimum signal-to-noise ratio obtains when the loop inductance equals the primary inductance. General expressions are derived for calculating the sensitivity for a 6-decibel signal-to-noise ratio, gain, and selectivity in loop-coupling transformers, when the condition of optimum signal-to-noise obtains. This expression for the sensitivity for a 6-decibel signal-to-noise ratio is also shown in a graph to facilitate the computations. The discussion is limited to the case in which circuit noise is the limiting factor for the sensitivity."
"A new-type oscillator is described which utilizes a simple resistance-capacitance feedback network with a single variable element controlling the frequency of oscillation. The design considerations outlined permit wide variations in frequency without excessive amplitude modulation or harmonic distortion. In principle, these common difficulties may be reduced to any desired minimum. This operation is achieved without the use of fiaters or limiter stages."
"A method of calibrating wavemeters in the microwave range is described in which the frequency of a calibrating oscillator having sufficient power to drive a wavemeter is continually checked against the harmonics of a crystal-controlled reference oscillator by visual means. The two frequencies being compared are separately heterodyned with that of a third oscillator, which is frequency-modulated. The modulation products then pass through a narrow-band receiver to an oscilloscope whose sweep is synchronized with the saw-tooth modulation voltage. Whenever the difference between the instaneous frequency of the modulated signal and the output of one of the generators equals the frequency to which the receiver is tuned, a pulse of energy is transmitted through the receiver and appears as a pip on the oscilloscope. Pips will appear corresponding to the moments when the instantaneous frequency is greater or less than that of each of the fixed frequencies. The oscillographic pattern then comprises two fixed pulses due to the reference oscillator, and another pair which can be shifted by changing the frequency of the calibrating oscillator. When the two pairs are superimposed, the frequency of the power oscillator matches that of the crystal harmonic. By superimposing the higher-frequency pulse of one pair on the lower-frequency pulse of the other pair, and vice versa, additional adjustments of the power oscilator can be made to differ from the standard by ± twice the frequency of the receiver."
"A graphical method of analyzing the performance of cathode-degenerated amplifiers and cathode-follower stages (triode, tetrode, or pentode) is outlined and illustrated. It is based on use of a curve relating grid-to-ground potential to the resulting plate currert, taking into account the effects of the voltage drops across cathode and plate resistors. This method yields complete performance data for the stage, unless reactive effects are encountered, and involves a minimum amount of plotting and computation."

"When two a-c fluxes, in quadrature, pass through a disk, driving forces and torques are produced. Theory is developed herein, and formulas and procedures are presented whereby the force or torque can be solved for, even when the fluxes are irregular as to area and distribution. As an example, the driving torque of a watthour meter is solved for. A chart for greatly facilitating the work is described. When a constant flux (or fluxes) passes through a rotating disk, a damping or braking torque is produced. With the aid of what may be a new concept, theory, formulas, and procedures are presented whereby the torque may be found, even though the flux (or fluxes) has an irregular area. To illustrate, the damping torque of a watthour meter is computed. The method can deal also with fluxes of non-uniform density. A chart is described which greatly reduces the work. When a disk with constant flux through it is moved translationally, damping forces occur. Curves covering a wide range are presented, by which those designing the damping for accelerometers and other instruments may design easily in direct fashion rather than by trial-and-error. For their benefit, this part of the paper is written so that it is complete in itself. For both driving and damping torques, reciprocity laws are proved; when needed, these laws greatly reduce the time required for a solution."
"The equations and equivalent circuits of all standard types of rotating electric machinery operating under arbitrary conditions may be derived as special cases of a single generalized rotating machine, the so-called primitive machine. This paper derives the steady-state equivalent circuit of the primitive machine having unbalanced rotor as well as stator. That is, the load or transmission line connected to a salient-pole synchronous machine is assumed to be unbalanced (due to faults, short circuits, and so forth), or the load connected to the slip rings of an induction motor is assumed to be unbalanced. The single-phase alternator, instrument Selsyns, and also sudden short-circuit studies are cases that require an infinite series of time harmonics in the stator and rotor windings in addition to the fundamental. It is assumed that these time harmonics are due to space waves with fundamental pairs of poles rotating at different speeds. The effect of the harmonic space waves is not considered. A paper by A. W. Rankin1 shows network analyzer studies made of the harmonic currents and torques of a single-phase alternator."
"Frequency error is an indicator of the amount of excess or deficiency of generation on a whole interconnection, and a frequency-generation line may be established for the whole or for any section which is separated from all others by tie lines over which control may be desired. Automatic equipment is available using these fundamentals under the name of load biased frequency control, which will make the required adjustments to generation to restore normal speed and tie line loadings with a minimum of false moves and by means of which each section will handle, in normal operation, only its own load changes, regardless of the speed of response of its prime movers to correcting impulses. Methods of automatic control by the selective frequency blocking system and the master flat frequency station method are examined and found wanting. The use of uncontrolled speed-sensitive governors with small droop is shown to be disadvantageous if operated in parallel with automatic bias equipment. Consideration is given to practical matters of operation, including an improvement in handling manual generation shifts, action of controller in time of trouble, effect of errors in determining the frequency-generation line, and desirable characteristics of governors."
"This paper reports initial work on an electronic method for operating several main aircraft engine driven alternators in parallel to supply the electrical loads of an airplane. This would make unnecessary any mechanical constant speed drive for each generator. An electronic frequency changer is associated with each alternator and the outputs of the changers paralleled at the load bus. Synchronization, load division, and provision for reactive power are discussed, and test data obtained from two 4-kva units are presented."
"Design considerations relating to the construction of a high performance servomechanism are discussed here. In particular, the improvement in performance that may be achieved through the use of lead networks* and the valuable guides to system synthesis afforded by sinusoidal analysis1-5 are demonstrated. Direct reference to an armature-controlled d-c motor system** designed by the author is made and its dynamic characteristics are considered in detail in order to show the correlation between theory and practice as applied to a servomechanism design."
"This paper describes an electric system for d-c generators used on aircraft that allows physical integration of all control elements normally associated with the control of the generator. The proposed system differs from the present system used by the Army and Navy primarily in that integration has been accomplished in addition to offering automatic control of the generator without a sacrifice in system performance. No attempt has been made to compare this system with present systems. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the individual control elements of the proposed system and to discuss their characteristics."
"The basic components of this instrument are (a). A large (35-pound) exciting coil with a pickup coil at its center. (b). An amplifier and integrating circuit. (c). A cathode-ray oscillograph. The instrument provides a convenient and rapid means of determining the magnetic properties of samples much smaller than can be used conveniently with the ballistic method. Absolute calibration provides greater accuracy and reliability than has been obtained previously in this type of apparatus. Phase errors are reduced to low values through the use of a compensated integrating network with absolute means of adjustment. This network provides a much higher output voltage than the usual circuit and thus makes practicable operation at the power line frequency and the consequent use of an exciting coil of sufficient size to minimize end effect errors and to allow operation at fields as high as 1,000 oersteds for long periods of time."
"This paper describes a method for calculating the speed-torque curve of a squirrel-cage induction motor when static capacitors are used to produce dynamic braking. The method is simple yet sufficiently accurate for the purpose of selecting equipment for any normal application. The advantages and disadvantages of this method of braking control are compared with those of other methods in use for squirrel-cage motors."
"Various methods employed in obtaining dynamic braking with a single d-c series motor are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the control of the dynamic braking contactors where braking is required on power failure irrespective of direction of rotation of the motor. The use of polarized spring-closing contactors offers a simple and reliable solution when ruggedness of the equipment is important. Methods of obtaining graduated dynamic braking automatically also are considered."
"Known methods of measuring Q in high Q resonant cavities, together with their accuracies and sources of error are discussed. For relatively low values of Q and of frequency, it is shown that band width methods are more accurate than decrement methods. For values of Q above 30,000 at frequencies above 3,000 megacycles the reverse is true. The significant feature of the present method, the wide range heterodyne decrement method, is that the accuracy is improved by observing the decay over a relatively long interval of time. An absolute accuracy of plus or minus three per cent and a relative accuracy of plus or minus two per cent are achieved. Design features and performance are discussed and constructional details are presented."
"Reduction of the initial and maintenance costs of the metering equipment required for the measurement of kilovolt-ampere demand has been an objective of the metering industry for many years. The development of a method of measuring polyphase ampere demand has made possible a simple and compact meter which registers kilowatt-hours and indicates maximum ampere demand. A good approximation of true kilovolt-amperes demand is then obtained by multiplying this maximum ampere demand by an assumed base voltage."
"The selenium-cadmium contact is a simplified version of the commercial selenium rectifier and is studied with the purpose of understanding the physics of contact resistance asymmetry. A theory by W. Schottky, which predicts the contact resistance at zero voltage and the course of this resistance with d-c reverse bias, is not adequate to account for the experimental data. An attempt is made to extend the theory by assuming a fraction of the bromine ions in the selenium to be free. Agreement with experiment is obtained for low voltages at a high temperature, but for high voltages at all the temperatures employed there is marked disagreement. The theory developed is sufficiently general to conclude that the contacts studied have either a polarizable layer less than 10-5 centimeter thick between the cadmium and selenium, or there is a mechanism of deactivation of bromine ions at higher voltages. The experiments do not distinguish between the alternatives."
"Aluminum alloy anodes have been used in approximately 1,000 installations of cathodic protection of steel water tanks using current from an outside source. From fundamental considerations it would be expected that the loss in weight per ampere hour of current passed from aluminum anodes would be less than one-third the weight loss from steel anodes. This addition, it was found that the aluminum anodes developed a more uniform attack than did anodes of steel or stainless steel. This is desirable because localized attack can result in early anode failure. The corrosion products from the aluminum anodes are white or colorless and adhere to the anodes. In the case of anodes of many other metals the corrosion products are strongly colored and fall off the anodes, thus discoloring or otherwise contaminating the water. Anodes of several aluminum-base alloys all have proved satisfactory in field installations. However, anodes of the aluminum-copper alloys (such as 17S-T or 24S-T) appear to be superior to anodes of unalloyed aluminum (2S) or to aluminum-zinc alloy anodes."
"The introductory review covers the major inherent and external regulating excitation systems which have been developed for use on Diesel-electric locomotives. A recently developed amplidyne excitation system using saturable core reactors and selenium rectifiers to obtain definite generator field and armature current limits is described in detail. Used in conjunction with a speed sensitive power plant regulator it provides complete and flexible engine control over its entire operating range of speed and power. Maximum flexibility of motive power is provided by safe and complete remote control which permits operating several locomotive units in multiple."
"This paper covers the general scheme and performance of a new dynamic braking system for heavy Diesel-electric road locomotives and a description of design features of the newly developed braking resistor unit."
"In the years 1945 and 1946 we have seen the completed development of new and larger Diesel engines designed specifically for use in main line Diesel-electric locomotives. Application of the larger electric transmission systems required for converting the engine power into tractive effort at the rail has presented new control problems, in the solution of which many new developments in circuits, apparatus, and manufacture have been made."
"This paper describes a new power plant regulating system which incorporates speed and load control, recognizes the ability of the engine, permits maximum utilization of the engine's power, and protects the engine from harmful overloads. The ability of the regulator to schedule permissible engine fuel as a function of engine speed allows it to be used with the latest type engines employing supercharger. The system permits remote and multiple-unit operation and provides a high degree of plant protection against damage because of failures."
"Several years of field experience with automatic circuit reclosers indicated room for worth-while improvements in the existing design. This earlier recloser incorporated time-lag tripping characteristics to allow co-ordination with other reclosers and with fuse links. the imporoved design helps reduce outage time by extending the range of co-ordination with fuses by means of high speed tripping and reclosing. This paper describes the new recloser and points out the application of its new features."
"Each type of local transit vehicle has its proper place in the picture of modern transit. This position is determined by sound economics, including complete depreciation on all equipment and facilities, The attractiveness of trolley coach service and its corresponding low operating cost enable this type vehicle to compete favorably with either the gas or Diesel bus even though new power and distribution facilities are required."
"Wood pole or structure fires of leakage-current origin have caused serious wood-member damage and service interruption. These fires often occur at the end of prolonged dry periods. Operating experience indicates surface tree carbonization on crossarms and pocket burninig at the crossarm-pole junction to be the two general types of burn damage. Pocket burning on some properties has been responsible for the larger part of the cases that required wood-member replacement. Laboratory tests conducted on approximately 200 specimens indicate that a coincident occurrence of dry wood and selective wetting of pole and crossarm surfaces by a light rain or fog, wind directed, which leaves a dry wood area in series with the leakage path, can result in a fire of a pocket type. This dry area, being high in resistance in comparision with adjacent series wetted-wood surfaces, results in a voltage concentration across the dry zone. If the dry zone is sufficiently short for a given circuit voltage, electrical breakdown occurs across the dry zone. This electrical breakdown being located favorably in dry wood and encouraged by a breeze may result in a pocket burn. Shunting devices which by-pass leakage currents around dry high resistance areas have proven successful in laboratory tests in eliminating pocket fires within the by passed zone."
"The PCC (Presidents' Conference Committee) car was developed about ten years ago as a result of a co-operative research program by the major transit operating companies and manufacturers. This paper briefly reviews the history and experience with the car and outlines the recent changes and improvements. New performance curves are included."
"The considerations involved in the design and application of automatic control of air switches are discussed in this paper with the thought that they might be used to guide designers and engineers who encounter similar problems. Three air break switch control schemes are described and the diagrams involved are shown. These control schemes were designed to provide automatic switching as follows: 1. Load transfer with synchronism check interlock, using direct current for operation and control. 2. Line sectionalizing and subsequent load transfer, using direct current for operation and control. 3. Load transfer, using alternating current for operation and control. The description outlines the operation of the various control devices for manual switching and for automatic switching which occurs during fault conditions."
"Thermal aging and humidification tests are reported on a silicone insulated railway motor. This included 1,675 hours at a temperature of 285 degrees centigrade with 46 cycles of severe humidification. Loss of initial moisture resistance was observed but no operating failure occurred. No change occurred in the heat dissipating characteristics of the machine. Finally, the motor was dismantled and the insulation examined in detail. Thermal aging data are interpreted."
"Laboratory aids for development of electromechanical systems are described in this paper. Standardized components for ``mocking up'' complex electromechanical systems have proved to be time-saving aids in laboratory work at the Sperry Gyroscope Company, Inc. Illustrations are shown of laboratory setups using these components and descriptions are given of the more generally used mechanical and electronic components."
"This paper discusses hydroelectric station equipment, operating procedures and the factors involved in applying automatic control. Hydraulic governors and the types of water wheels (impulse, reaction, fixed propeller, and adjustable propeller) are described from the electrical engineer's viewpoint. A typical automatic control diagram is shown for each of the two methods commonly employed for accelerating the generator and synchronizing it with the system. In one method, termed self-synchronizing, the machine circuit breaker is closed at less than synchronous speed, and the machine synchronizes after its field is applied. In the other method, automatic speed matching and synchronizing equipment bring the machine on the line at correct voltage and phase angle. Considerations involved in applying supervisory control to automatic hydroelectric stations are presented."
"The magnetic flux distribution in a welder throat, containing two steel sheets, is calculated as a potential field. On this basis, the flux density in the sheets and the flux change caused by their presence in the throat are computed, and furnish the voltage drop caused by the sheets if they would be unsaturated. Actually, the sheets are saturated, and this condition is considered by approximating the magnetization curve of the welding material with a broken line. The corresponding voltage components are calculated for various dimensions of the throat and of the sheets, for different positions of the sheets in the throat, and for different welding currents, and agree satisfactorily with test results."
"The switching of high-voltage transmission lines and underground cables occasionally produces overvoltage surges on electric power systems. While operating experience generally has been satisfactory voltages of 66 kv and below, there have been transient disturbances of considerable magnitude at the higher voltages. The length of many of the transmission lines and the importance of maintaining continuity of service on heavily loaded interconnections have stimulated a critical analysis of the problem. However, in contrast to the extreme overvoltages predicted by theoretical studies, a review of several hundred field tests over the past ten years, including many tests with voltage records by cathode ray oscillographs, discloses practically no cases of line or bus surge voltages on solidly grounded systems reaching transient peaks as high as 2½ times normal line-to-ground crest voltage. This paper attempts to evaluate the effect of both the circuit constants and the characteristics of the various types of interrupters used in modern high voltage oil circuit breakers on the magnitude of switching surges. Particular attention is given to the advantages and disadvantages of such oil flow pistons or low ohmic value resistors in parallel with the main arc extinguishing devices."
"This paper discusses the co-ordination of internal transformer fuse links with line sectionalizing devices on 7.2/12.5-kv multigrounded neutral rural lines, and methods for improving this co-ordination and the electric service to farm areas. An internally mounted primary fuse link is an integral part of the transformer on a large number of the transformers supplied to rural electric systems. In the interests of more adequate sectionalizing and less interrupted power aimed toward the improvement of electrical service to the farm consumer the following suggestions are made: 1. Internal links of various transformer manufacturers should be standardized. 2. The rating of the link in the conventional internally-fused-type transformer should be no greater than that in the entirely self-protecting type of the same rating. 3. The characteristics of the internal link should be designed for better co-ordination. 4. The characteristics of sectionalizing reclosers should be designed for better co-ordination. 5. System studies should give consideration to proper co-ordination of reclosers and transformer protective equipment."
"Methods of measurement and calculation of resistance welding tools, particularly for the large group of nonstandard type portable welding guns, are contained in this paper. Electrical characteristics have considerable bearing on 1. Kilovolt-amperes at an installation. 2. Required secondary voltage of the welding transformer. 3. Efficiency of the tool. Timesaving means for either measurement or calculation provide accuracies well within the average requirements of the engineer. The approximation calculation of inductance is semiempirical in nature to facilitate computation of tool or cable reactance and can be extended in principle to various types of welding equipment."
"Three full years of operating experience with single-pole switching on five 132-kv transmission lines totaling 331 miles in length is presented and analyzed. Total number of faults for the period studied was 59, of which 54 were of temporary nature. Of these 54 temporary faults, 42 involved only one phase and ground, and 38 successful single-pole fault clearing operations were experienced. Conclusions are that singlepole switching has numerous advantages over multipole high-speed switching in that better system stability is realized by its use, longer phase de-energization time permits greater time for dissipation of ionized gases at the point of fault, and over-all system disturbance is minimized during fault clearing operation."
"In the past, it has been necessary because of unco-ordinated circuit design to build synchronous-precision welding controls which were useful for only one application. By redesigning the welding control circuits and mechanically separating each basic electrical function, a versatile line of welding controls has been obtained. This paper describes some of the redesigned circuits in the new line of welding controls."
"The magnitude control of thyratrons in regulated rectifiers is accomplished effectively by the use of a shunt tube bridged across the d-c output and resistance coupled to the thyratron grids. The shunt tube grid operates from the output of a regulating feedback amplifier to give precision voltage regulation and highly improved dynamic response to transients, as well as electronic ripple suppression. Extensive application of this recent development has been made in supplying plate power to video and d-c amplifiers for radars and computers. Closely regulated d-c power for electronic equipment is not unduly costly when the shunt tube technique is applied."
"This paper describes a flat type of step-by-step switch and its associated equipment which recently has been introduced in the United States for dial telephone switching systems. ``Truly, this (the automatic telephone system) seems the very high-water mark of human creative power.'' This remark was made by Doctor J. A. Fleming, the eminent British electrical engineer, about 1920 when referring to the step-by-step and other dial telephone systems. The step-by-step system, which previously had been developed by Strowger and others,1 at that time was being widely installed in England and other locations, both here and in Europe, and since has become the most universally adopted method of dial switching."
"This paper describes a mercury-vapor tube and associated circuits used to obtain the arc-back rate of various grades of graphite which might be applied in ignitrons and other types of electronic tubes. The methods of test and results obtained are included. The tests indicate that the arc-back rate of a graphite anode can be reduced by degassing at 1,800 degrees centigrade and that this improvement is maintained at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure. It also is shown that anodes when not in operation get charged with arc-back causes of two classes-those that can be persist regardless of heating and apparently are removed by the arc-back itself."
"This paper describes television network facilities which are needed to connect studios and other pickup points to transmitters in the same and in distant cities, and discusses their transmission characteristics. Short-haul television circuits may be by microwave radio or over wire circuits. Long-haul television connections may be by radio relay or over coaxial systems of the type originally developed for carrier telephone circuits. Transmission requirements include adequate frequency band, accurate gain and phase equalization, and freedom from interference resulting from excessive noise, crosstalk, or modulation. Radio and wire systems are under development to provide extensive high-quality television networks."
"A microwave point-to-point radio system is described which is designed for the transmission of television programs. This system is intended to supplement wire facilities for local distribution of television signals from pickup points to studios or from studios to broadcast transmitters and to long distance network terminals. The circuits and equipment are described in detail. Performance obtained in tests during 1946 is given."
"Communication cables consist of a number of electric conductors insulated from one another and encased in a metal sheath. This encasement is subjected to numerous hazards, such as those caused by electrolysis, crystallization, various kinds of mechanical damage, and lightning burns. Any damage to the sheath which will permit water enter the cable will decrease the effectiveness of the insulation material and thus cause an impairment or an interruption to the service. The entrance of moisture through small openings in the sheath can be materially retarded when the space inside the cable, not occupied by the conductors or insulation, is filled with a gas maintained under controlled conditions. Nitrogen is the gas usually used for this purpose because it is inert and does not combine chemically with the conductors or insulation. In addition the use of the gas provides a method of locating openings in the sheath by means of a pressure gradient, which is a material aid in cable maintenance."
"Frequency shift telegraphy is described and compared with amplitude modulation telegraphy under various conditions found in radio and wire transmission. Experimental data are given to demonstrate the influence of various design factors on the over-all performance under these conditions. It is shown that the most outstanding characteristic of the frequency shift method is its ability to accept large and rapid changes in signal amplitude. Frequency shift telegraphy thus proves to be of great advantage for use in the high-frequency radio range. Frequency shift telegraphy also shows an advantage over amplitude modulation telegraphy with respect to noise. For applications where the level variations are small or slow, the advantage of the frequency shift method over amplitude modulation is relatively small."
"Transmission on long nonloaded submarine telegraph cables has been improved by application of efficient signal-shaping amplifiers, replacing electromechanical types of receiving equipment; also by duplex balances of greater accuracy through use of new artificial line networks and new methods of balancing. With these improvements it became practicable to change from cable code recorder operation to printer operation and at the same time to obtain higher quality of transmission at increased speeds."
"This paper deals with the application of a carrier system developed primarily for providing rural telephone service over power distribution circuits in areas where this means of extending telephone service may be more attractive than other available methods. The modifications required in the power circuits to permit carrier frequency transmission are described, including the effect of these modifications on the operation of the power system. Construction features also are discussed. The use of the rural carrier telephone system over open wire telephone pairs is discussed briefly."
"While experience to date is still limited, it definitely has demonstrated the feasibility of higher voltage long span joint use in rural areas. Economic studies still in progress indicate that where new extensions are to be made to provide both power and telephone service, worthwhile economies can be realized in most cases by such joint construction. Where power lines already extend over the area, modification of such lines to accommodate communication circuits of course will introduce an additional element of cost. Even in this case, however, it appears that there will be an over-all economic advantage in favor of joint use as compared to separate lines. The relative field of application of joint use and of the carrier system discussed in a companion paper3 must be determined by experience. It is evident that they will supplement one another and taken together will further promote communication coverage of rural areas."
"The first rural party-line telephone service by radio installations operating on the subscribers' premises was inaugurated August 20, 1946. This paper describes the equipment used, how it operates, and the results obtained during the preliminary testing and the initial period of regular operation. Radio is one of several new methods which the Bell System is exploring in its program for extension of telephone service in rural areas. It is expected that experience gained in this experiment will aid in developing a standard rural radiotelephone system."
"Pulse echo measurements have been used on telephone and television facilities since 1940 to locate impedance irregularities and control quality in manufacture and installation. These sets send a pulse into a line and observe on an oscilloscope the echoes returned from irregularities. The shape and width of the pulse, the rate at which it is repeated and the pulse magnitude are important in determining the accuracy of the results and the requirements of the measuring apparatus. The ``coaxial pulse echo set'' is used for factory and field testing of coaxial cables. The ``Lookator'' was developed for use on much narrower band systems such as spiral-four field cable and open wire lines."
"In this paper the authors show the relationship to be expected between observations of surface temperature rise by various methods of measurement. Predictions based on laboratory tests are shown to be borne out by practical tests on induction motors. The data presented provide a basis for comparing a number of methods of temperature measurement from the stand-point of repetitive accuracy and the degree to which they indicate the true surface temperature."
"The planning of modern power system expansion demands that voltages, phase angles, power flow, and reactive power flow throughout the network be determined in advance of actual system changes. Determination by calculation of these quantities increases in difficulty to such an extent, as the system increases in size, that, for large interconnected systems, it heretofore has been considered necessary to use a network analyzer for this work. Since the first a-c network analyzer was put in service at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1929 the scale model method of handling complex power system problems has grown in popularity, and the number and size of analyzers in the United States has been increasing steadily. To date, 14 network analyzers have been constructed, and more are on order, all at a total cost approaching two million dollars. A widespread, but misguided, belief prevails among power system engineers that the foregoing problems are not solvable practically except with the aid of an analyzer. It is the purpose of this paper to set forth certain principles and methods which so facilitate the handling of problems of power flow in networks that the mathematical solution appears more feasible than the analyzer solution. The methods and equations presented in this paper have been tested by recomputing an actual network analyzer study by mathematical means for comparison. Data and answers from this study are tabulated in this paper. The mathematical solution was first made with a key calculating machine."
"Air-borne magnetometers developed during the war for the detection of submerged enemy submarines now have become important tools for aerial geophysical exploration. The instruments described utilize the second harmonic outputs produced by the magnetic field in saturated core inductors for field measurement and for control of servo stabilizing systems acting around two axes to maintain the measuring element in alignment with the earth's field. The field to be measured is compared continuously with that produced in the measuring inductor, winding by an accurately controlled direct current. The sensitive element usually is towed in a bombshaped bird sufficiently removed from the airplane to escape the effects of its magnetic field. A continuous record is produced which, when keyed with position records obtained by photography or shoran, may be used in the preparation of maps of total magnetic field intensity."
"The continuous finishing of textiles with machines operated in tandem, or \"in range,\" requires carefully coordinated, adjustable-speed machine drives. Electric drives, as compared to mechanical drives, generally offer several advantages, and are used predominantly on modern range installations. Of the electric systems, d-e drives are most generally suitable and most widely used, although a-c drives are used advantageously under certain circumstances. There are several types of co-ordination control that may be used on range drives, each type having certain advantages and disadvantages, depending on the basic type of range drive used. This paper gives general information on textile ranges, basic requirements of range drives, basic considerations in selecting drive equipment, comparison of electric and mechanical drives, description of various types of electrical drives and co-ordination control, and recommendations for selecting proper equipment for specific conditions."
"In the preceding investigation the quantities upon which distance relays must depend for their operation have been determined for all possible types of faults occurring at a single location. It has been shown that the quantities obtained by the use of earlier distance relay connections for both line and ground faults do not give the closest approach to the desired result, a constant indication for all types of faults at a given location. It has been shown further that, by the use of different connections and certain auxiliary apparatus, a constant relaying indication may be obtained by the line relays for all types of line faults and by the ground relays for all types of faults involving ground, if the fault resistance is zero, and, if the fault resistance is not zero, that smaller deviations from the normal value will be obtained for a given fault resistance. The analysis has been based upon the assumptions of sine wave currents and voltages, constant circuit impedances, and negligible distributed capacitance in the faulted sections of line. It has been assumed further that the fault impedance is resistance only and that it is effectively constant throughout each cycle. All of these assumptions, except perhaps the latter, are reasonably valid as far as relaying is concerned, although some consideration must be given to the d-c component of the short-circuit currents with very high-speed relays."
"Hiperco alloy is an improved ironcobalt alloy specifically developed for electric machinery applications, where weight or space is at a premium. The basic composition is 34.5-35.5 per cent cobalt with an alloying element such as chromium added to improve hot and cold workability and increase electrical resistance Processes have been developed whereby the alloy can be cold rolled to any desired gauge. Because of its high magnetic saturation value (over 12 per cent higher than that of iron), its unusually high permeability for magnetizing forces in the range H = 10 to H = 400 oersteds, and because of its low losses at high inductions, Hiperco alloy will enable manufacturers to produce motors and generators considerably lighter in weight than by using present standard materials."
"Three portable test sets developed for the improved cable carrier telephone system are described: A high sensitivity selective transmission measuring set covering 10 to 150 kc, a decade oscillator for frequencies from 2 to 79 kc, and a tube test set."
"The range of application of current transformers in bus differential protective systems is limited by saturation in the transformer cores under fault conditions, which may sometimes result in improper relay operations. It is shown that the addition of impedance in the relay circuit will reduce the relay current under fault conditions so as to increase the range of applications for which standard current transformers may be used."
"Acceleration can be measured with a vacuum tube conisisting of a fixed cathode and two plates, one on each side of the cathode. The plates arc mounted elastically to deflect in response to acceleration normal to their plane. Displacement of a plate alters the electron current delivered from the cathode to that plate. A tube of this type is described which has a natural frequency of about 800 cycles per second, a flat response for sinusoidal accelerations up to 200 cycles per second, and a linear range of 150g. The output at accelerations of 10g is sufficient to drive a high frequency recording galvanometer directly, without the complications of an amplifier. The pricipal disadvantages of the tube are an unpredictable ``zero drift'' and a ``zero shift,'' following impacts of very short duration."
"A new 12-channel cable carrier system is described which is suitable for transcontinental communications. Important features are negative feed-back amplifiers of improved design, new arrangements for accurate equalization of the cable loss, and automatic thermistor regulators which continuously control the transmission of each system."
"The transient-energy method is a newly developed means of checking and quantitatively evaluating the transient stability of a system of three, or possibly more synchronous machines. Each machine is represented by a constant-magnitude voltage behind a fixed reactance (usually the transient reactance) and all losses and nonsynchronous loads are assumed to be constant throughout the transient. The method is developed in this paper specifically for the 3-machine problem and is demonstrated in two examples. The potential energy required to displace the machine rotors from the relative positions which they would occupy in steady-state after-transient operation is the basic function utilized; it may be expressed as a scalar potential function of two rotor-difference angles. Two critical (zero-slope) points of the potential energy function are located graphically; those points are 1. The minimum, which is the locus of steady-state after-transient operation. 2. The minimax, the rotor-difference-angle combination at which stability may be lost with the smallest amount of transient energy. The potential energy of (2) with respect to (1) is computed and compared with the initial transient energy, calculated with respect to condition 1. If the allowable transient energy (former) exceeds the actual transient energy (latter), the system is stable."
"The development of general equations for the magnetomotive force of 2-layer windings depends upon the summation of the magnetomotive forces of the individual conductors in the slots. By the use of unique methods of summation, it is possible to derive equations for the winding factors of both integral and fractional slot windings without resorting to tabular or vector diagrams. The equations are developed for any phase angle and may be applied to 2-phase, 3-phase, 60-and 120-degree phase belts, or any other that represents a usable winding."
"The high frequency resistance of several coils was measured. An approximate method is derived to determine coil resistance for coils wound with flat strap. A short empirical method for obtaining coil resistance for coils wound with tubing also is shown. Factors affecting coil resistance are discussed."
"The continuous horsepower rating that is assigned to a given induction motor is determined mainly by the full load temperature rise of the machine. The temperature rise is dependent on both the losses in the motor and the effectiveness of its ventilation. While an accurate theoretical prediction of temperature rise is very difficult, a simple empirical method is presented here which gives good results over a wide range of motor sizes. The familiar D2l equation for horsepower output is discussed from the point of view of temperature rise, and a new form of equation is suggested which takes into account both ventilation and motor losses. By relating the horsepower output directly to the major physical dimensions of the induction motor a consistent basis of design is established for machines of widely different sizes and speeds."
"This paper describes a means of producing the core loss loops of samples of magnetic strips on an oscilloscope screen and a method of obtaining the heat loss from the areas of these loops. The standard Epstein test for obtaining the core loss requires a correction for corner effects due to stacking of the laminations, whereas the method described here circumvents this problem by utilizing only the center portion of a relatively few short strips of the test material. Since quantitative measurements are made, circuit refinements, such as negligible phase shift couplings between amplifier stages and stabilized voltage supplies, are incorporated into the circuits."
"The problem of obtaining dynamic braking automatically in the event of power failure is discussed for 2-motor drives. Various methods of connecting the two motors are considered from the point of view of service-requirements."
"The combined advantages of the quick indicating capacitance meter and the precision capacitance bridge are obtained in a new form of self-balancing capacitance bridge. Features of the new instrument include per cent deviation indications, a wide capacitance range and an average balancing time of less than two seconds. A single scale, easily read and greatly expanded, serves for the entire range of the instrument and represents an improvement of some 3,000 per cent over conventional capacitance meters. The paper discusses the bridge network development, detector system requirements, and other design considerations."
"A new method of single-side-band generation, working-on the frequency-addition principle, is described. Apparatus consists of linear modulators combined with wide-range phase-splitting circuits to produce the signals."
"Outstanding economies may be effected by metering high-voltage loads on the low-voltage side of the power transformers, and compensating the metering to include the transformer losses. The transformer-loss compensator is an accessory to the regular watt-hour meter on the low-voltage side and causes the meter to include the transformer losses in its registration. No changes are made in the meter itself, either structurally or in adjustments, it retains its integrity as a standard measuring instrument. The method is intended primarily for use on customers' installations where the contract provides for supplying and billing for energy and demand at distribution or transmission voltages. Based on established principles, the accuracy performance is equal to that of metering on the high-voltage side. Testing techniques have been developed and co-ordinated with meter testing practice, so that its routine application and maintenance can be done by metermen. This paper is the result of experience with compensating meters since 1932, and the more recent application of transformer-loss compensators. It is intended for electrical utility executives and engineers considering the possible advantages of the method for their systems and for guidance in co-ordinating the application of transformer-loss compensators with metering practice."
"This paper presents engineering and lightning performance data on the Tennessee Valley Authority's 161-kv and 115-kv transmission lines. Normal maximum line loadings are tabulated, and certain transmission line operating practices are described."
"The paper gives the results of a series of co-operative laboratory aging tests made on Manila paper in oil sealed in glass tubes. The aging temperatures were 100, 120, and 135 degrees centigrade. The changes in tensile strength, elongation, folding tests, oil color, and oil acidity are given in tabular form in Tables I, II, and III. The tensile strengths of the paper in per cent of initial versus time are plotted in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The 120- and 135-degree-centigrade tests are completed. The 100-degree tests are being continued."
"A radically new modulation technique for multichannel telephony has been developed which involves the conversion of speech waves into coded pulses. An 8-channel system employing pulse code modulation (PCM) and embodying these principles was produced. The method appears to have exceptional possibilities from the standpoint of freedom from interference, but its full significance in connection with future radio and wire transmission may take some time to reveal."
"Early in 1948 the Board of Transportation of New York, N. Y., will place in service the first of several hundred new subway cars, marking the post-war revival of one of the oldest and best established branches of the electrical traction industry. Since the year 1900, more than 11,000 passenger cars have been built for the four large cities in the United States having rapid transit systems, a large percentage of which are still in service. An expansion program needs, therefore, to recognize and conform in general to established practices of operation, maintenance, and service conditions. This paper discusses the extent to which modern features of higher acceleration, dynamic braking, and smoother operation are being introduced without any major changes in the existing systems and operating methods."
"This report of the AIEE relay subcommittee presents the results of a 3-year investigation of present and preferred practices in the relay protection of power transformers. Consideration is given to the influence of advances in the protective art and progress in the design of and methods of operating power transformers. A survey covering experience with over 56 million kva of power transformers has been analyzed in the light of the characteristics of the relay devices now available, in order to develop criterions of adequacy of protection and its inherent limitations and to recommend desirable improvements in devices and methods."
"The importance of adequate city transportation is recognized. Successful handling of the rapidly increasing travel during the war as well as the subsequent high level of traffic that has been maintained proved difficult. Trolley coaches and Presidents' Conference Committee street cars were introduced in 1928 and 1936, respectively, and the total now exceeds 10,000. They established a high degree of availability and usefulness in meeting war demands and have a definite economic field of application for city transit ranging from 500 to 12,000 maximum passengers per hour in one direction. They use city streets efficiently and reduce traffic congestion. Operation is quiet, a feature which adds greatly to the comfort of the ride. The trolley coach has ample power for rapid accelerating at 3.5 miles per hour per second; it will run above 40 miles per hour, and normal stopping ability equals 3.5 miles per hour per second. The control provides quick, smooth starting and stopping. These performance details combine to produce schedule speeds of 12 to 15 miles per hour. Motor capacity of the PCC street car is liberal so as readily to permit 3.5 miles per hour per second starts. Car speeds exceed 40 miles per hour and service dynamic braking is at 3.15 miles per hour per second. The latter is supplemented by drum and track brakes. The 99-step control provides smooth starts and stops. These features combine to produce schedule speeds 25 per cent, or more, beyond those of old street cars."
"Voltage regulation of an alternator historically has depended upon variation of the field current, and high-speed regulators have been developed in order to improve synchronous stability. This paper describes a voltage control brought about by varying the output current. A reactive load is connected to the generator terminals. This load is varied electronically in such a way as to maintain the desired voltage and line current. Whereas regulation by field control is limited by the long time constant of the field winding, the electronic stabilizer acts upon the transient reactance and therefore it has the fast response needed to regulate the terminal voltage. The paper describes a new method for increasing the stability limits by supplementing present known methods and extending the limits of a-c power transmission. The electronic stabilizer is intended to take care of certain regulating functions which cannot be performed by a field regulator. The use of the two in combination, therefore, can be expected to yield still further improvement. No attempt has been made to compare this method with other methods of compensating the line and it is intended that these methods may be used in combination. Tests of a model equipment are described. A rough comparison has been made between this system and the use of series capacitors. Using present costs and parameters, the cost of the series capacitors was somewhat less. Further cost changes may alter this comparison, or there may be cases where series capacitors are not acceptable."
"The concepts of minimum band width and nonminimum band width servo-mechanisms are introduced. Minimum band width servomechanisms are dealt with in this paper. A systematized approach to the synthesis of such servomechanisms is outlined and the method applied and detailed results obtained for one practical class of such servomechanisms. The technique enables the stability requirements and the accuracy requirements to be considered separately in succession. An engineering criterion of servomechanism stability is enunciated. The critical design parameters and performance characteristics, including amplitude and phase margins, are tabulated for a practical class of minimum band width servomechanisms over the range of degree of stability of engineering interest. The corresponding build-up times, damping factors, and natural frequencies also are tabulated. Extensions of the viewpoint and method described are outlined."
"Selective or sequential tripping in low-voltage air circuit breaker application provides for removal from the system of a faulted part only, leaving the rest of the system in operation. Present standard circuit breakers generally are not suitable. Solution of the problem is through direct-acting series tripping means with distinct current-time characteristics in ranges of overcurrent and fault current, with minimum time to complete interruption the objective. This subjects the circuit breaker to the very severe duty of having to carry short-circuit currents for appreciable times, whereas standard circuit breakers have been designed to open instantaneously. Modified standard circuit breakers may be applied to selective tripping, with limitations of application based upon (1) rated interrupting capacity and (2) series trip coil rating. As tests show that modified standard circuit breakers will carry short-circuit current for necessary times, they also may be applied with relay schemes requiring delayed tripping. In systems using cascade or backup arrangements of circuit breakers, little is gained by selective tripping. It is recommended that for a particular installation choice be made between selective tripping and cascade arrangement, according to relative importance of advantages of each."
"The general problem of shipboard electric equipment is reviewed in relation to the use of silicone insulation as a possible means of providing smaller lighter weight equipment. Silicone compounds are discussed giving physical and chemical properties which are of interest to the Navy. Laminated and molded insulation is discussed giving the development problems involved as well as showing present test data."
"Various types of pulse amplitude and pulse time modulated waves have been analyzed by a novel method to determine their exact frequency spectra. Using these results the inherent distortion produced when the audio signal is recovered with a low-pass filter is calculated. The minimum allowable ratio of pulse repetition frequency to maximum audio frequency is expressed in terms of the distortion and the percentage modulation. The form of the result is shown to be common to all types of pulse time modulation. The effects of pulse width, pulse shape, and percentage modulation on the required bandwidth are also discussed."
"In the further development of pulse time multiplex systems the form of modulation known as pulse count modulation (PCM) has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. This work reviews briefly the principles of pulse communication and its extension to PCM. Unlike the conventional types of modulation, PCM is represented by a discrete scanning of the amplitude of the modulating signal rather than a continuous amplitude scanning, in addition to the discrete scanning in time which is common to the other forms of pulse modulation. The discrete nature of such a system introduces a type of distortion which is a function of the number of amplitude levels used. The relation between the numbers of levels and this type of distortion has been investigated and is discussed. Several types of signals are analyzed mathematically; namely, a single-frequency signal, a 2-frequency signal, and finally a continuous band of frequencies. In connection with the multifrequency case, the application of the Fourier transform to pulse amplitude modulation and its extension to PCM is introduced. In addition, the cross talk introduced in different channels of the modulating frequency is shown graphically for several amplitude levels."
"This paper describes communication and control systems used by the Tennessee Valley Authority, principally to expedite the operation of its multiple-purpose dams, electric power generating stations, transmission lines, and substations. Seventy per cent of the 10,000-mile communication and control system is obtained by carrier channels superimposed upon power lines. This paper explains relationships which exist between carrier channels that are utilized for pilot relay, remote trip, telemeter, automatic load-frequency control, and telephone purposes. Close engineering co-ordination of 45 telephone switchboards, including 13 of the automatic type, and a variety of kinds of telephone circuits, totaling over 6,000 miles in length, permits the rapid handling of 2,500,000 telephone calls each year. The basic equipment used in establishing these circuits and their flexible interconnecting arrangements is standardized and the units are applicable to systems of any size."
"1. Although the German electrical utility undertakings had facilities for nation-wide interconnections, and although they had a well co-ordinated operating organization, the German electrical utilities did not succeed in nation-wide interconnected operation, mainly because of technical limitations. 2. Germany, like the United States, entered the period of World War II with identical percentages of spare capacity. Germany, unlike the United States, began to feel capacity shortages as early as 1940, which shortages became more pressing as the war progressed, while in the United States there was at no time during the war a shortage of capacity. 3. Except for the rapid development of air circuit breakers, development in design and construction of plant facilities progressed, in general, along similar lines as in the United States, although with somewhat less regard for reliability. 4. Although the German electrical utility industry was never a primary target for aerial assault, it suffered considerable damage principally through aerial warfare. 5. The collapse of the German electrical utility system was coincidental rather than contributory to the general industrial collapse of Germany toward the end of the war."
"This paper describes a number of typical faults which have been experienced in large transformers oil the Saguenay system. Cases are noted where gas detector relay protection would have obvious advantages. Some conclusions are noted regarding the value of this type of protection, based on faults selected from operating experience with 124 transformers over a period of about 26,200,000 kilovolt-ampere-years. Illustrations of incipient faults which have been detected by gas relays are included."
"Wood chippers require motors with special characteristics to operate under exacting conditions involving high peak loads, severe vibration, acceleration of high inertia, and exposure to dirt and moisture. Methods are given to select the most suitable size of chipper, to determine the proper rating and characteristics of a motor to drive it, to choose beetwen synchronous and induction motors, and to select the mechanical arrangement of the drive. The modifications in mechanical construction of the motors to enable them to withstand the severe operating conditions are described and illustrated. Desirable features to be included in the control are given."
"The old d-c presaturated reactor has experienced a revival with the appearance of the metallic rectifier. The combination of these two devices is studied with an idealized magnetization curve as a basis. Two typical connections are chosen as examples, namely one polyphase connection without self-excitation and one single-phase connection with self-excitation. The behavior is very similar to that of grid-controlled rectifiers. There is a marked difference as to the dynamic properties of the two connections. Much more rapid response is obtained at correct design than generally expected, making the application to quick-acting regulators often quite possible."
"The previous part of this paper covered the initial development and application of the distributed concentric type of power transformer design. This type of design is chiefly suited for the larger sizes of power transformers in voltage classes of 138kv and up. This part deals further with the distributed concentric type transformer. Principal points covered are 1. Commercial impulse voltage testing is discussed. Impulse distribution tests made at low voltage have been adopted as standard commercial tests for distributed concentric type transformers. These tests determine the distribution of impulse voltage in the transformer winding for any specified shape of applied wave. Typical distribution tests are reported as taken on a commercial transformer. 2. A new form of insulating cylinder has been developed for application in the major insulation structure. The cylinder wall is unique in that it is porous and contains no bonding agent. This results in improved characteristics as compared to conventional type composition cylinders. The porous cylinder is made by a novel process which is illustrated and described. 3. Application of the basic design has been extended now to include transformers in the 138-kv, 161-kv, and 230-kv voltage classes. A particularly large transformer, weighing 250 tons complete, has been manufactured. Shipment was made to the Pacific Coast with the transformer proper assembled. The shipping clearance problem was met with a novel tank construction which is illustrated and described. 4."
"Two improvements in klydonograph surge recording are described. The first is a simplified double electrode recording unit in which a rubber band is used to hold the unit together and make it light-tight and weather-proof. The second is a coupling unit used for high voltage lines and equipment which greatly facilitates the use of the klydonographs by connecting them on the line side of the capacitance voltage divider."
"The frequency of occurrence of defects in electrical insulation can be shown to follow the Poisson law of probability. One of the more important defects in thin paper insulation is conducting particles. In this paper expressions are derived for the probable breakdown voltage as a function of conducting particle occurrence. It is shown by statistical evidence that large conducting particles exist in the insulating paper and bridge one or more layers of paper in the finished capacitor through chance reorientation caused by manufacturing processes and operation. The degree and frequency of reorientation of particles with a typical grade of paper is determined experimentally, and the probable insulation thickness and consequent voltage strength of various size capacitors is calculated. A method of determining the optimum voltage strength of this insulation is illustrated. It is concluded that conducting particles are a predominant factor in determining the voltage strength of present day capacitors and that one of the greatest opportunities for improvement lies in the reduction of the conducting particle content in the paper."
"The explosions in hospital operating rooms are not frequent, but the result is usually disastrous. Doctor Williams has ably presented the problem. The solution is a difficult one in that small charges of static electricity created from the soles of shoes rubbing on floor, blankets being pulled over one another, or the placing on the face or the taking off the face, of a face mask, is sufficient to cause an explosion. To develop satisfactory short-circuiting and grounding apparatus on movable pieces of equipment in the hands of lay people, as far as electric equipment is concerned, is a most difficult problem. [Includes discussion by Wills Maclachlin (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and W.C. Wagner (Philadelphia Electric Company, Philadelphia, PA, USA).]"
"The necessity for greater service continuity on low voltage systems has focused attention on the limitations of present delayed overcurrent tripping devices and created a demand for their improvement. This paper reviews the limitations of present devices and states the requirements for delayed overcurrent trips. A new device meeting all of the requirements is described and its characteristics shown. The new device is universal in its application in that the same elements provide for circuit breaker selectivity up to the highest values of fault current and yet give correct timing to permit motor starting. Tests are described which show the adequacy of the new device for its intended service as well as indicating an unusual degree of reliability."
"This paper presents results of a study of the large amplitude oscillations of aerial conductors called galloping. The work was undertaken in an attempt to evaluate the possibility of mitigating the damage caused by these disturbances. A full scale experimental line is described which is so constructed that, without ice formation, it will gallop typically and vigorously under ordinary wind conditions, thus allowing study of various means of mitigation. Data on the behavior of this line are presented. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate further study on this important problem and thus hasten the development of a practical soltution."
"Frequency-modulated carrier telegraph equipment provides advantages in transmission efficiency which have led to its extensive application. This paper describes a frequency-modulation telegraph terminal from which relays have been entirely eliminated so that the over-all circuit between ultimate operating positions is completely electronic. The circuits employed are described in detail, design considerations are discussed, and application information is given. The results of various performance tests also are included. In the development of this system, significant economies have been effected by reducing equipment complexity to a minimum, thereby saving space and simplifying maintenance."
"A new approach to the analysis of the performance of d-c interrupters has been made in which the arc voltage of the interrupter is considered on an equal footing with the d-c generated voltage. The effect of variations in the circuit constants as well as circuit breaker speed and arc voltage wave shape and magnitude are evaluated on a quantitative basis. The equations and curves are presented on a per-unit basis which makes the work applicable to any d-c interruption problem. The work sheds light on design and application criteria of d-c interrupters. The presentation is arranged to be easily digested by the student of electrical engineering."
"A method is explained of calculating and plotting tension-length curves for suspended conductors. Application of the tension-length curves to the determination of increased sags in suspension spans occuring when a conductor breaks and other transmission line problems are described and illustrated. Other than for the calculation of the tension-length curves, adequate accuracy is obtained using a 10-inch slide rule."
"The tests definitely have shown and subsequent field experience have demonstrated that the high pressure water stream method of cleaning insulators is both practical and more economical than other methods used. It presents one of the best opportunities for the reduction of the maintenance cost on transmission and distribution lines. A high pressure compact and solid water stream will remove practically 100 per cent of ordinary dust and dirt and from 50 to 85 per cent of bad contamination. tion. The flashover voltage is raised to practically 100 per cent of a new clean insulator when ordinary dust and dirt are removed. The flashover voltage is increased enough so that the badly contaminated insulators may remain in service if washed frequently. Tests have shown very definitely that the stream of water should hit the insulator before it breaks into a spray if a good cleaning job is obtained, especially if the insulator is contaminated badly. Cleaning insulators with a high pressure stream of water is a safer method than wiping by hand. If the workman maintains the generally recognized safe working distance, he will not receive a shock or a dangerous leakage current through the stream of water. It eliminates the ever present hazard of a lineman climbing a pole supporting an energized line and an unenergized line and inadvertently wiping the energized insulators. The reduced expense of cleaning insulators will allow more frequent cleaning and will eliminate to a very great extent pole top fires."
"This paper presents the results of a generalized study that has been made on the transient speed response of basic forms of speed regulating systems to suddenly applied square wave load torques. The solutions were obtained on the transients analyzer and the electrical analogies for the systems are developed. The solutions are applicable to d-c motor drives with either variable armature voltage or motor field current control and two inherent time delays, one of which must be in the motor armature circuit. Stabilization is effected by means of an ``anticipatory'' RC circuit just following the error signal and an RC feed-back circuit just after the first inherent time delay. The type of system specifically illustrated in the paper is one with an electronic amplifier, Rototrol, and d-c generator that supplies the armature voltage. The study shows the effects of all system parameters, including a series self-energizing field that may be used with Rototrols to eliminate steady-state speed errors. It was found practical to define optimum forms for the response to impact loading in terms of crest transient speed dip, time to recover normal speed, and per cent system damping. A set of generalized dimensionless curves presents the performance of such regulating systems in terms of these characteristics, together with the anticipation and feed-back circuit constants required for optimum solutions. These curves cover the practical range of all parameters."
"This paper covers the development of a co-ordinated d-c aircraft generator control and protective unit of the draw-out type. The scheme of operation of the unit is described briefly and the advantages of using such a co-ordinate (control assembly are discussed."
"General parameters are given for the circuits that make up echo-type supersonic flaw detectors used in the location of defects in large metal forgings. Applications of such equipment are listed and a bibliography of pertinent articles is included."
"This paper describes the bearing deviation indicator (BDI), a war development that greatly increased the effectiveness of sonar equipment in antisubmarine warfare. Limitations of sonar equipment without BDI are explained, the value of crossed-lobe techniques for improved bearing accuracy is discussed, and the value of simultaneous lobe comparison in underwater sound work is pointed out. Methods of meeting the over-all requirements are described, and examples are given of service equipment. Certain auxiliary features of these equipments-time-varied gain, reverberation-controlled gain, and own-Doppler nullification-are discussed, and mention is made of specialized test equipment."
"This paper presents a simple method for accurately measuring voltages present on high-voltage systems during both transient and steady-state conditions without modifying the conditions producing the voltage to be measured. An electronic amplifier having high input resistance and negligible circuit loading provides adequate current to operate magnetic oscillograph galvanometers (or meters and relays) in proportion to the input voltage obtained from capacitance voltage dividers. These may be transmission line switching-transient voltages, voltages across circuit breaker contacts, static capacitor transient voltages, or neutral displacement voltages. Frequencies ranging from direct current to a hundred or more kilocycles are within the capability of the device, although the actual value, determined by the indicating or recording instrument which it actuates, may be limited to a few thousand cycles. Limitations and problems encountered in the use of capacitance potential dividers are also briefly discussed."
"A marked improvement in corona starting voltage and flashover voltage for small ceramic bushings has been obtained by the use of semiconducting coatings. This is of special importance for air-borne radio and radar equipment. The results cover both a-c and d-c behavior for several sizes of solder-seal bushings. A sensitive oscilloscopic method detects disturbances at voltage gradients where the ionization-by-collision process begins. These gradients, far below the visual corona points, are calculated from graphical maps of the dielectric fields associated with the bushings."
"This paper presents some new formulas for the differential leakage reactance of distributed polyphase windings, such as those of induction motors and voltage regulators. Previous authors have used two distinct methods for evaluating the differential reactance, but the results obtained by these two methods have been inconsistent, particularly for open slot machines. The overlap method is based on calculating the average overlap of the teeth on the primary and secondary, and then calculating the leakage through the zig-zag flux path under the combined influence of the primary and secondary ampere turns. The ``differential method'' is that of calculating the leakage by taking the difference between the total flux produced by the primary or the secondary, and the fundamental sine wave of the flux. When the effects of flux fringing with open slots are included, the results obtained by the two methods are shown to be entirely consistent. The new formulas derived in this way are believed to be more general in application than any heretofore published. They show that the slot openings decrease the differential leakage reactance much more rapidly than they decrease the magnetizing reactance."
"The surge comparison test can be adapted readily to testing fractional horsepower motors quickly and in large quantities. The effect of time duration of the test is minimized, and switching surges resulting from the testing apparatus are eliminated. The test applies a voltage stress to the winding, thereby showing any weaknesses. It detects short circuits, grounds, errors in turns, and errors in connections with a high degree of accuracy. Thus the surge comparison test is a valuable method of insuring a quality product with small expense and little interruption of production."
"The use of large amounts of power in aircraft becomes a power-handling problem; and electric transmission from the turbines mounted in the fuselage, to the propellers on the wings, has the same advantages as in handling very large amounts of power in industry. The advantages of electric power transmission are discussed, principally flexibility, reliability, ability to shut down prime movers, and lessened drag. Also the disadvantages-principally weight. An outline of an acceptable airplane and the calculation of fuel savings resulting from electric operation of a given flight plan are given, showing that it is possible to save enough fuel to cancel out the extra weight of the electric drive. Also, a discussion of weights of apparatus is given."
"Progress in the field of direct-inking oscillographs has made the development of a d-c amplifier very desirable. This paper describes the circuits used to obtain the characteristics desired in a d-c amplifier when it is used with a direct-inking oscillograph. The combination of these circuits resulted in the development of a direct coupled amplifier which is operated entirely from an a-c source. The amplifier has a very low drift rate and, mechanically, is readily portable. The performance of the direct-inking oscillograph and d-c amplifier is illustrated with chart records showing recordings of d-c pulsations and sine waves. The treatment of the subject matter is concluded with a description of an industrial application in the use of the oscillograph with a d-c amplifier."
"Rapid and extensive changes in airport lighting have been made within the last ten years. The necessity for providing elevated high intensity runway and approach lights as an aid during low visibility conditions, both day and night, has been generally recognized. With the advent of adequate runway lighting, boundary lights and floodlights (for runways) have become unnecessary. The provision of high intensity runway and approach lights of the latest type results in a 10,000 per cent increase in power consumption per runway."
"Starting with the theory of operation of a-c commutator machines, it is shown how either a single or polyphase generator can be built whose frequency is controllable and essentially independent of speed and whose general characteristics are similar to those of a d-c generator. Among the principal topics discussed are The generated voltage equation-Voltage regulation. Parallel operation. Compensating windings. Motor operation. Commutation. Compounding. Self-excited operation."
"The theory of the development of torque in a hysteresis motor is analyzed from both the hysteresis lag angle and total loop energy points of view. A new development, comprising the use of a closed slot stator in co-operation with a hysteresis rotor, which permits building hysteresis motors of high power output at high efficiency is explained qualitatively and supplemented by considerable quantitative experimental data. A new method of stator construction, permitting the use of closed slot stator laminations assembled on a mandrel with non-magnetic bearing supporting spiders, wound externally in either a d-c type of armature winding machine or with form-wound coils, impregnated with a thermosetting resin and baked to form a unitary structure, is described. The electrical design of the machine is covered and quantitative data on both design details and operating characteristics are given on several models."
"A description is given of developments employing frequency division techniques by which the telephone-message-carrying potentialities of the coaxial cable system are realized. By these methods 480 high quality telephone messages are prepared for transmission over the line and restored to original condition at main terminal points. At intermediate points appropriate groups of channels may be removed, inserted, bridged, or relocated in the frequency spectrum of the line."
"A group of halogenated gaseous compounds have been investigated to determine their impulse (1½x40-microsecond wave) and 60-cycle strength in uniform and nonuniform fields at pressures of 1,2, and 3 atmospheres. The scope of this investigation was confined to bare electrodes, and additional testing will be required to determine the behavior of these gases with various types of solid insulation. It has been found that sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) possesses superior insulating properties for high-voltage apparatus, even at these relatively low pressures. Data obtained in an approximately uniform field indicate that at 30 pounds gauge. pressure this gas approaches the impulse strength of oil. Therefore, certain classes of high-voltage apparatus advantageously may use this gas for their insulation, if other properties are adequate."
"At the beginning of and during the war with Japan, the wide expansion of operations in the Pacific Theater over-taxed the Navy's radio communications to a point where the need of additional communication channels became acute. The adaptation of a 4-channel Western Union type multiplex to a single-channel frequency-shift radio system appeared to be the most logical way to solve this problem quickly. Improvements in the radio and the use of the multiplex enabled the Navy to set up communication channels between the United States and all the principal naval bases in the Pacific. A 4-channel circuit was established between Washington, D. C., and Honolulu, T. H., and San Francisco, Calif., and Honolulu within approximately nine months after the beginning of initial tests. Other systems followed in close succession."
"Probability calculations furnisha useful means whereby the average frequency and duration of generator outages on a power system, as shown by experience records may be converted into a consistent measure of the expectancy of multiple outages upon which the provision of reserves is based. This paper gives the mathematical development of relatively simple formulas for this purpose and methods of calculation and of exhibiting the results in tangible form. Use of these formulas does not require familiarity with technical probability mathematics."
"Electric current density penetrates or ``soaks'' into an electric conductor starting from the surface during current transients in a manner physically and mathematically analogous to thermal diffusion in transient heat flow. This useful concept is used to explain physically and evaluate numerically transient resistance and inductance of conductors subjected to rectangular current wave impulses."
"When two power systems with different frequencies are connected together through an asynchronous tie, the transient behavior of the tie under a sudden change of load on either side becomes of great importance. The paper derives by the tensorial method the steady-state equivalent circuit and the transient equations of a variable-ratio frequency-changer set consisting of an ohmic-drop exciter, regulating machine, and induction machine, when an unbalanced load is applied suddenly to the stator side of the induction machine. A companion paper by Carter, Maginniss, and Rothe gives the results of the solution of the equations by the a-c network analyzer and the differential analyzer."
"The fundamental principles of operation and application of Rototrols have been discussed in a number of papers and publications. These have dealt with a unit having only one stage of amplification of the control energy. Such machines have been applied widely during the last 15 years with excellent results. Recently a few applications have arisen in which the control energy available was too small to provide satisfactory regulation. The use of a second unit operating as a control energy amplifier was then needed. The development of the 2-stage Rototrol permits the use of only one machine in such applications. The simplest construction of this machine is a 4-pole design. It is a normal generator except for the field coils and armature connections. With such modifications this paper shows that the machine may be considered as three generators superimposed on one another. The output of only two of these is used in the machine under consideration. The analysis of operation and means of compensation for the resulting reactions are given. Tests of two designs show that high sensitivity and speed of response were obtained. It is concluded that the development of this machine provided a generating element for Rototrol systems which requires an extremely low value of control energy."
"The approach to terminal switching equipment herein described presents a new concept for higher voltage switchgear. It is believed that this concept, while not confined to higher voltages alone, will provide all the functional advantages of conventional switching equipments along with great economies in space and cost. At the same time, it should result in increased safety and decreased maintenance."
"Summarizing the characteristics of these drives with respect to wind tunnel research requirements, we have the following: Range in which speeds can be regulated Slip regulator-40 to 97 per cent. Clymer drive-Any speed from 1 to 96 per cent. Effect of load on speed regulation Slip regulator-Loads must be predetermined for all speeds. Clymer drive-Can be set at any desired speed for any load within the rating of the machine. The control is independent of the load. Effect of temperature, frequency, and voltage variation Slip regulator-Speed regulation is affected by both temperature and fluctuation in frequency. Clymer drive-Speed is completely controllable under temperature and frequency variations and is independent of voltage fluctuations. Slip energy Slip regulator-Energy wasted in heat dissipation. Clymer drive-85 per cent of slip energy returned to the supply circuit."
"This paper presents a derivation of the circle diagram and performance formulas of the polyphase brush-shifting motor (Schrage type). Using similar assumptions as required for the derivation of the Heyland circle, a simple diagram is developed, which permits the graphical determination of current, power factor, output, slip, and copper losses of the machine. Design formulas are given."
"Until recently spark-over and corona starting voltages could be predetermined satisfactorily only in cases where experimental curves or empirical formulas were available. The advent of the Townsend theory,1 and later its modification, led to a general method in breakdown calculations, although these were not entirely successful until a more complete knowledge of the Townsend coefficients for air was obtained.2-4 Based upon this knowledge and from published data Ver Planck5 developed a method especially applicable for calculating initial breakdown voltages for nonuniform fields which converge toward the cathode. Though still empirical the increased data enabled more accurate results to be obtained from this method. The purpose of this paper is to apply the theory to a case where the field is produced between a flat plate and an edge formed by two intersecting planes, verifying experimentally."

"The outward physical manifestations of heat, power, and radioactivity unleashed do not represent the true significance of the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Since the short period after Hiroshima and Nagasaki when an earnest and humble effort was made to find the right answer to the control of nuclear fission a generally complacent attitude has developed. That the peoples and rulers of the world need to be educated to the revolutionary conditions related to the atomic bomb there can be no doubt and avoiding the facts that are before us will not solve the problem."
"A staff of over 450 personnel, 75 of whom were civilians from the Naval Research Laboratory, the Signal Corps engineering laboratory, and 13 industrial and academic laboratories, was required to carry out the electronics activities of Joint Army-Navy Task Force One for Operation Crossroads. This article comprises parts of what was presented at a joint meeting of the AIEE New York Section, the New York section of the Institute of Radio Engineers, and the Radio Club of America on November 6, 1946. Donald G. Fink (M '45) spoke on television and remote control as it was used at Bikini; and T. D. Hanscome described the equipment used in the telemetering of air and water pressures, the telemetering of radioactivity, the study of electromagnetic effects including radio and radar monitoring, and the measurement of timing. Several phases of electronics as used in the control of the drone airplanes and the actual detonation of the bombs were outside of the jurisdiction of the electronics co-ordinating group according to Captain Engleman who presided over the meeting."
"With the increasing demand for accurate measurements in all branches of the sciences, the many advantages provided by the use of electrical means in measurement have led to their general utilization in problems incorporating large numbers of physical quantities. Because the employment of electricity has complicated measuring equipment further, a practical system for analyzing measurement systems is needed. Through the use of functional analysis any measurement system can be considered as being composed of not more than three functional parts, thus reducing an almost unlimited variety of equipment to a relatively few fundamental types."
"Quality control, a technique based on a study of variations in process, utilizes statistical methods for detecting defects in quantity manufacture. However, it is a theory founded on the elementary laws of chance and thus a knowledge of these laws is of invaluable aid to the engineer who must specify the required tests, adapt his designs to the tools available, and adjust his tolerances correctly."
"House heating by extraction of heat from the earth through a circulating refrigerant has proved practical and economically feasible in a test conducted during one season in Indianapolis, Ind., according to an article by A. C. Crandall, vice-president, Indianapolis Power and Light Company, Indianapolis, in Electrical World for November 9, 1946. Records show that during the 8-month heating season, although outside temperatures dropped as low as ten degrees below zero, inside temperature was maintained at a constant 72 to 74 degrees."
"The rural circuit offers important engineering problems commonly overlooked; problems which can stimulate and challenge the electrical engineer, particularly the young engineer."
"For years, the average Mexican, and most especially the Mexican farmer, has been existing on an economic level which does not include an adequate supply of even the barest necessities. The Mexican Government, in its desire to raise the standard of living, realizes that the only hope for a country whose agricultural lands already are overpopulated lies in industrialization. For equipment, for technical information, for investment, Mexico looks to the United States with the assurance that, rather than close the market to foreign products, the fostering of Mexican industry, by increasing the economic capacity of the people, will create an even greater demand for American-made goods."
"Characteristics of electronic instruments such as extreme sensitivity, great amplification, and fully automatic operation permit measurements to be made which are not possible by any other means. Although it is in such applications that they find their greatest present use, with the production of components better suited than existing ones for heavy-duty industrial service electronic measuring devices should find greatly extended employment."
"AUTOMATIC RECORDING of various phenomena is being used more and more each day and is spreading to all fields of industry. During the war, automatic recording and controlling methods were one of the main factors that enabled this country to far surpass the production efforts of all other nations. The atomic bomb would not have been possible without the recorders and controllers that were so essential in this development."
"ALTHOUGH a relatively new development in the field of process instrumentation, the electronically operated null-balance recorder has proved to be a versatile and powerful aid to the optimum operation of these processes. It has solved many complex recording problems that appeared to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, with mechanical instruments. Standardization on basic instrument design for a great variety of measurement is perhaps the greatest advantage over mechanical and conventional electrical instruments."
"THE MEASUREMENT of d-c potentials of the order of 10–6 to 10–9 volt without the use of sensitive galvanometers has been accomplished only within recent years. Such voltages are encountered in thermopiles, thermocouples, and other similar devices. The small power available from such devices has required the use of delicate galvanometers in conjunction with elaborate mechanical means for recording and controlling functions. Because such galvanometers were of slow time period the recording and controlling action was limited in its speed of response. Direct amplification of the d-c potentials often has been suggested as a means of eliminating the sensitive galvanometer. However, the normal instability and the inherent dependence of d-c amplifiers upon tube characteristics and supply voltage have eliminated them from general use. The ordinary a-c amplifier has so many advantages over the d-c amplifier that it generally is used in all methods of amplifying small d-c potentials. In order that the a-c amplifier may be used, a system for converting the initial d-c potential to alternating current must be accomplished. At this low level of potential a device for changing direct to alternating current is called a “converter.” A device which changes amplified alternating current back to direct current is called a “re-converter.”"
"THE PREFERRED WAY to use electron tubes for measurement is in a-c amplifiers, even though the measurement to be made is by d-c means such as the electromotive force of a thermocouple. Based on the use of such amplifiers, a development was undertaken in 1929 toward a faster and more sensitive d-c potentiometer recorder."
"FAST SELF-BALANCING POTENTIOMETERS were improved vastly during the war for the rapid recording of thermocouple voltages. In certain of these, the direct current of the thermocouple is converted by mechanical oscillators to alternating current, and amplified to drive the balancing motor. These give good vibrationproof performance, but because their input circuit is connected directly to the power amplifier through the converter one must take care to shield the input against electromagnetic pickup such as results from operation of switches, and must avoid grounding both the instrument and thermocouple, because multiple grounds can introduce currents which are converted and amplified to cause large errors in the record."
"SWEEP-BALANCE RECORDERS are a new kind of automatic potentiometers different from step-by-step recorders and continuous-balance recorders. A Wheatstone bridge circuit (Figure 4) is combined with a strip chart recorder in such a way that the slide contact is co-ordinated with a stylus traveling across a chart, which consists of voltage-sensitive paper such as “Teledeltos,” the medium used in Western Union facsimile recorders. The conventional null galvanometer or null motor in the output of the bridge has been replaced with a high-speed null relay which may be either of the electromagnetic or electronic type. The paper is marked only when a discharge from a capacitor is passed from the stylus to the paper and the grounded drum under the chart. The connections are such that the discharge is released when the output voltage of the bridge becomes zero or the phase of the output voltage reverses with respect to the input voltage (bridge balance)."
"The following essay is presented for the recreation of the reader. Can you solve the problem?"
"A new approach is offered to aid in the understanding of the physical phenomenon of the interaction of a moving electron and a deflecting electric field. Issue is taken with classical theory and proof is advanced to show that the mass of an electron is constant and independent of velocity but the inertia and elasticity of the electric field cannot be neglected. This material is scheduled for presentation as a conference paper for discussion at the AIEE winter meeting, New York, N. Y., January 27–31, 1947. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING presents this material to stimulate debate on an important and controversial topic. Comments are invited."
"This straightforward statement of the present generally accepted theory is a correlation of widely scattered material well-known to scholars in the field, but heretofore not collected."
"IN the past there have been few ties between the engineers and the other professions, but for that matter, the engineers have not exhibited much coherence among themselves. Industry has used their services freely but logically has felt little responsibility in guarding their special interests. The engineers, on their part, have drawn heavily upon the several fields of science without feeling any strong impulse to act jointly with scientists in the development of general scientific interests. They are, in consequence of this peculiar relationship, literally and figuratively “in the middle.”"
"The handicap under which China has attemped to start industrialization is due largely to the inadequacy of her electric power installations. Installed generating capacity per capita in China is 1.7 watts, less than 0.5 per cent of that in the United States. Future power development has been planned by the Chinese National Resources Commission involving almost two million kilowatts to be installed in the next five years. This ambitious program, which almost will quadruple the present capacity, may meet with success or failure depending upon the outcome of the present civil war and the establishment of economic stability."
"The winter meeting to be held in New York, N. Y., January 27–31, 1947, will feature a broad program of professional and social activities. The technical program, the largest in the history of the Institute, is a manifestation of the effort of the AIEE to cover the technical field completely. This is evidenced further by the holding of a special conference on the technical activities. The program is comprised of 26 technical sessions, presenting about 100 papers, and 16 technical conferences. As an innovation, the Edison, John Fritz, and Hoover Medals will be presented in general sessions in the afternoons, co-ordinated with technical sessions appropriate to the fields of achievements of the medalists. A group of inspection trips also has been arranged closely allied with the subject matter of several sessions. On the social side there will be a smoker, theater tickets for out-of-town members, and special entertainment for the women. Meeting headquarters will be in the Engineering Societies' Building."
"At the beginning of the administrative year 1945–46 the AIEE committee on planning and co-ordination was given the special assignment of studying membership needs and desires for the intended purpose of guiding and stimulating the development of AIEE activities and services, the better to serve the Institute's rapidly growing diverse membership. In September 1945 two subcommittees of the committee on planning and co-ordination—one on technical activities and one on professional activities—were appointed by President William E. Wickenden (F'39)."
"The essential portions of an informal progress report of the technical activities subcommittee of the planning and coordination committee as presented to the board of directors at its October 23d meeting have been compiled for Electrical Engineering by M. D. Hooven (F '44), chairman of the subcommittee."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"As a service to AIEE members, there was published in 1937 by the Institute under the auspices of the power transmission and distribution committee a “Lightning Reference Book” which was compiled by the lightning and insulator subcommittee. It included a reproduction of some 200 technical papers on lightning which had been published up to 1935. These papers had been selected carefully by the committee to include the outstanding information on the lightning problem as it affected the electric industry."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."

"The title signature is a reproduction of that which Edison attached to the AIEE prospectus issued in April 1884. “Biographical Memoirs of Thomas Alva Edison”, which appears here in digest form, was presented to the National Academy of Sciences by Arthur E. Kennelly at the autumn meeting, 1932. Doctor Kennelly was a past president of the Institute (1898–1900), Honorary Member (1933), and Edison Medalist (1933). He was closely associated with Edison, being his principal assistant at one time. He died June 18, 1939."
"THOMAS A. EDISON was an active AIEE member from the time of the founding of the Institute to his death in 1931. He signed the circular which was issued in April 1884, soliciting support for the proposed organization of “The American Institute of Electrical Engineers.” At the second meeting of the organization held May 13, 1884, election of officers was held. Edison, shown here as of that time, was one of the six vice-presidents elected at this meeting. He held office for two years, but because of dearth of Institute news printed in the early Transactions very little is recorded about his activities during this time."
"The “Edison effect” was the subject of the first AIEE technical paper, which is reproduced photographically here. This electron-emission phenomenon is the basis for the entire modern electronics industry."
"Awarded for meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering, or art, the Edison Medal is one of the greatest honors of the Institute. The medal was established at the AIEE banquet in honor of Edison and the 25th anniversary of the incandescent light. A part of the banquet program is reproduced on the adjacent page."
"During the past ten years the labor-management problem has become one of major concern. To provide some basis for analysis, the author has interviewed approximately 60 leaders in each field and has prepared a summary of their reactions to the problem. The main difficulty seems to be an inability, or unwillingness, for either side to understand the other's position or to modify its own. The article emphasizes the importance of mutual understanding and a common aim—mutual, not separate, survival."
"China, with her vast unexploited natural resources and immense population still existing in a handicraft economy, offers one of the most fertile fields for industrialization in the world today. In spite of internal political strife which is hampering her development at present, Doctor Koo, Chinese ambassador to the United States and chief Chinese delegate to the United Nations, is confident that his country is well on the road to the economic stability which is necessary to attract foreign capital."
"For convenient reference, some of the more common measurement units and scales used in communication engineering are presented in tabular form together with supplementary explanatory text. Included in the table, which also indicates the limitations involved, are quantities used in measuring power, volume, circuit noise, sound, light, radio fields, crosstalk coupling, and certain other transmission concepts."
"The Pick-Sloan plan, as basis for the proposed development of the Missouri Basin, is described as intended to provide for the generation of hydroelectric power as well as flood control and irrigation. The development of so-called potential hydroelectric power sites is stated to depend upon factors such as essential need and estimated cost, but in general the author believes that the intrinsic value to the government of the power itself will exceed greatly the value of the revenue from its sale. Costs are not discussed."
"During the past 50 years the development of professional and technical organizations has progressed steadily in Canada, as have movements to attain professional recognition for the engineer. Because of the current general interest in the subject of engineering professional organization, this descriptive review of Canadian developments in that field has been prepared by the AIEE vice-president for the Canadian District."
"The success of dielectric and induction heating in wartime production indicates their continued successful use in peacetime industry for many applications which ordinary heating processes have not accomplished. Though the methods of heat generation are vastly different, both types of heating are based on disturbance of the molecular structure. Each, however, has its individual field of application, with induction heating intended primarily for metals, while dielectric heating is applied primarily to nonconductors."
"A specialist, one of the German scientists whose presence in the United States in connection with rocket and aviation research-was revealed recently by the United States Army Ordnance Department and the Army Air Forces, assists in preparing a V-2 rocket for firing at the Army Ordnance Proving Ground, White Sands, N. Mex. Preparation for launching of the missile is expedited by the new gantry crane. Assembly and firing of the rockets were supervised by the General Electric Company"
"Reciprocating steam, Diesel-electric, and electric locomotives compete today for main-line freight and passenger assignments. It is doubtful if the present struggle for dominance among the three will be influenced greatly by other types of locomotives. Reciprocating steam locomotives have occupied a position of leadership since the coming of the railroad, but it is apparent that they face strong competition from Diesel-electric and electric motive power."
"In 1941 a number of factors precipitated a power emergency in the southeastern portion of the United States, particularly in the states of Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia, which, if permitted to get out of control, might have retarded the war effort seriously. To counteract this effect, a power pool was organized through the efforts of the Federal Power Commission and the Office of War Utilities which successfully met the demands of the situation, as well as providing experience which proved to be of great value in co-ordinating the power supply of the United States throughout the war."
"This brief outline of the main consecutive stages in the development of high-vacuum electron tubes during the last quarter century is presented from the viewpoint of a large electrical manufacturing company. The outstanding problems of early research and development viewed in retrospect well may serve to refresh the memory of the readers."
"According to a recent General Electric Company announcement, electric welding equipment has been used successfully to thaw frozen water pipes with no special equipment other than reliable pipe clamps for firm connections. Connections are made in the ordinary way with the work and electrode leads connected to the pipe on opposite ends of the frozen section so that the heat generated in the pipe wall will thaw the ice. The current to be used has been set at between 200 and 500 amperes, but the time required varies greatly. Tables I and II will help determine the various factors involved while Table III shows maximum outputs obtainable from equipment which normally would be used for pipe thawing purposes."
"In the United States some 1,500 veterans of World War II and a total of approximately 240,000 persons are handicapped by loss of vision. Much has been done to aid these individuals, but the present occupational fields open to them are very limited. Development of suitable instruments for measuring and computing, guidance devices, and devices for reading printed material; and creation in the mind of industry a better attitude on capabilities of the blind are of major importance in their aid. Some progress has been made, but in order to overcome the limited application of Braille and the handicaps involved with guide dogs mechanical and electric equipment is being developed and refined."
"RECENT DEVELOPMENTS in the knowledge of the factors influencing the rate of deterioration of insulating materials have extended the power of engineering statistics for determining the amount of accrued physical depreciation in electric equipment. Procedures based on these developments and adapted to the particular case under investigation should be of considerable help in valuation work. A short time ago the author had occasion to determine the depreciation of the electrical components of a utility property of substantial size containing a number of generators and transformers of varying age. Recognizing the importance of heat in the deterioration of insulating materials, an investigation was made of the company's records with respect to the age and temperature history of the windings of the individual items of equipment, to which this principle was applied with gratifying results."
"A conference of students and counselors held by AIEE Middle Eastern District, October 26, 1946, at Pennsylvania State College, State College, Pa., was attended by 23 students, and 10 faculty members representing 8 different educational institutions."

"The first order form for AIEE Proceedings appears on pages 33A-34A in the advertising section of this issue. As previously announced (EE, Dec '46, pp 576–8; Jan '47, pp 82–3) Proceedings is a new series of publications designed for the technical specialist and consisting of individual sections in pamphlet form, each containing full formal text of a technical paper with its related discussion, if any. Proceedings sections are available to Associates, Members, and Fellows, in accordance with the instructions given on the order form."
"The eighth progress report covering the status of projects of the air transportation committee as of October 18, 1946, recently was submitted to the AIEE Standards committee. Developments in the work of standardization since the seventh progress report {EE, Aug-Sept '46, pp 407–08) dated June 27, 1946 are given in the reports of the subcommittees."
"Lists various society-based activities and events that may be of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The two technical papers previewed in this section will be presented at the AIEE winter meeting, New York, NY, USA, January 27-31, 1947, and will be distributed in advance pamphlet form as soon as they become available. Members may obtain copies by mail from the AIEE order department, at prices indicated with the abstracts. Prices of mailed copies to nonmembers will be twice those for members less five cents."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"Meeting December 18, 1946, to discuss the organization of the engineering profession, approximately 280 members of the Schenectady (N. Y.) General Electric Engineers' Association expressed their overwhelming support for a course of action similar to “Plan B” described by the professional activities subcommittee of the AIEE committee on planning and co-ordination in the April 1946, issue of Electrical Engineering, pages 169–73. Ninety-nine per cent of the group attending the meeting favored the rapid formation of a national society to raise the professional and economic status of all engineers, a society which would supplement the technical activities of the existing societies. The following report was prepared for Electrical Engineering by G. E. Walter (A '44) of the AIEE Schenectady Section, who is chairman of the national association and legislation committee of the SGEEA."
"The yearly report of the Engineering Foundation was submitted by Chairman A. B. Kinsel and Director E. H. Colpitts (F' 2 ) at the annual meeting of the foundation."
"Use of the Engineering Societies Library in 1945–46 was 15 per cent greater than in the previous year, according to the annual report submitted by Ralph H. Phelps, director of the library. An average of 130 persons have been served by the library each day. All services have had greater use, except the photostat service which has decreased about nine per cent. This is explained by the fact that it had experienced an abnormal growth during the war."
"The problem of more adequate housing for the Founder Societies and associated societies which occupy the Engineering Societies' Building remains the chief concern of the United Engineering Trustees, it was revealed in the annual report of UET President J. P. H. Perry."

"This month marks the hundredth anniversary of the birth of the inventor of the telephone, who was a charter member of the Institute, one of its original vice-presidents, and its seventh president (1891–92). Among the awards he received were the John Fritz Medal (1907) and the Edison Medal (1914). The story of his life is one of alternate discouragement and success, with his outstanding achievement constantly postponed by the urgent needs of more immediate problems."
"Thomas A. Watson (F '15), who assisted in the development of the telephone and who died December 14, 1934, delivered this address at the annual meeting of the AIEE in New York on May 18, 1915, upon the occasion of the presentation of the Edison Medal to Alexander Graham Bell. The address is given here as it originally was published in AIEE PROCEEDINGS, volume 34, number 8, August 1915, pages 1503–13."
"A superiority of man power, raw materials, and industrial capacity, plus the protection afforded by two oceans, have been sufficient to assure to the United States a share in the victory in past overseas wars. However, Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker warns that warfare of the future practically will eliminate both time and space factors; that, to remain on the winning side, the United States must reorganize its entire defensive structure to provide for the eventuality of sudden attack on home soil."
"The development of the magnetron is a typical story of a device which has passed down the technical “production line” from a principle of physics through engineering development to an operating device. This example illustrates not only the infinite possibilities that exist in the field of science, but the fact that the development of these possibilities is a process which transcends the efforts of any single individual or organization."
"Uninterrupted, sensitive, and immediately responsive steering control on shipboard is of utmost importance to safe navigation. Most American-built ships have employed steamengine drive or electrohydraulic gear operated by telemotor control for turning the rudder because of its relatively simple operation and construction. World War II saw the United States utilize electrical steering with complex relay and contactor circuits. The AEG Ward Leonard system described here has been used extensively abroad where marine designers and operators have held strong aversion to power contactor switches and relay controls in steering equipment."
"Knowledge gained Irom wartime research in microwave techniques is being applied to improve the peacetime design of television receivers for home use. Receivers now are available which incorporate these radical changes in design."
"PRESENTATION of the 1946 Edison Medal to Lee de Forest (F '18) “for pioneering achievements in radio and for the invention of a grid-controlled vacuum tube with its profound technical and social consequences” was made by AIEE President J. Elmer Housley on Tuesday, January 27, at a general session of the 1947 AIEE winter meeting. David Sarnoff (M '23) introduced the medalist. The history of the medal itself was given in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for February 1947, page 122."
"IN MY YOUTH I learned a Bible verse which read, “If ye have faith, all these things shall be added unto thee,” which in my case I found should be supplemented thus— “faith, plus longevity!” The laurel is better late than posthumous!"
"Presentation of the Hoover Medal for 1946 to Doctor Vannevar Bush, (F '24) president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, was made January 30, at a general session of the AIEE winter meeting. Established in 1930 through a trust fund created by the gift of Conrad N. Lauer, the Hoover Medal is awarded periodically by a board of award composed of representatives of the national societies of civil, electrical, mechanical, and mining engineers “to a fellow engineer for distinguished public service.” The first award was made in 1930 to former President Herbert Hoover."
"I ACCEPT THE HOOVER MEDAL for 1946 with a deep feeling of gratefulness and pleasure. Let me say that in accepting it I regard it as in the larger measure a symbol of your recognition and salute to the able and unselfish men with whom it has been my rare privilege to be joined in collaboration and partnership in these recent years."
"THE JOHN FRITZ MEDAL for 1947 was awarded on January 29, 1947, to Doctor Lewis Warrington Chubb (F'21) for “pioneering genius and notable achievements during a long career devoted to the scientific advancement of the production and utilization of electrical energy.” The presentation took place during the AIEE 1947 winter meeting, New York, N. Y., at a general session presided over by Malcolm Pirnie, member of the board of award. The medal was presented to Doctor Chubb by N. E. Funk (F'34) chairman of the board of award."
"The award of the John Fritz Medal, established in memory of one of the most outstanding figures in the development of the iron and steel industry, and sponsored by the four founder engineering societies, is indeed an honor which I cherish deeply. On several occasions in past years while attending engineering conventions in this auditorium, I have witnessed the presentation of the John Fritz Medal to distinguished and deserving engineers and scientists whom I admired and envied."
"By wide margins new records were established at the second AIEE postwar winter meeting, held in New York, N. Y., January 27–31, 1947. A final verified registration of 3,567 exceeds by approximately 40 per cent the previous all-time high record of 2,624, established at the winter meeting in January 1946, and is nearly double the earlier record figure of 1,931 established at the winter meeting in Philadelphia in January 1941. The winter meeting program, too, established an all-time high record in the number of general and technical sessions, technical conferences, business conferences, and working meetings of committees, subcommittees, and working groups of committees."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"C. B. Jolliffe (M '34) of Radio Corporation of America, Princeton, N. J., opened the session on television on January 28 by announcing that because of a Federal Communications Commission hearing at the United States district courthouse the facilities of WNBT (National Broadcasting Company television station) would be devoted primarily to the exhibition necessary for this, and that certain demonstrations which had been planned for the AIEE meeting might have to wait. Television is a subject of live interest to electrical engineers as a means of communication and as a user of power. The whole television system should be considered as a unit, main parts of which were considered by separate papers."
"Recent developments in nuclear energy have given impetus to new methods of supplying electric power and have led to the sponsorship by the AIEE committee on basic sciences of a series of conferences on methods of producing electric power and to the establishment of a subcommittee to investigate energy sources under the chairmanship of W. A. Lewis (F '45) of the Armour Research Foundation, Chicago, 111. The first conference was held January 29 during the winter meeting with J. D. Tebo (M '36) chairman of the committee, presiding. An audience of more than 500 was present."
"The symposium on limitations of light production at the winter meeting on January 29 was under the guidance of S. G. Hibben (M'45) Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Bloomfield, N. J., and chairman of the AIEE committee on the production and application of light. Papers and discussion dealt only with the visible spectrum. Mr. Hibben presented an illustration that a 30 to 1 ratio exists between possible and present lights based on the theoretical 100 per cent mechanical efficiency of 620 lumens per watt for a single spectral line at 5,560 angstroms."
"Approximately 100 engineers and manufacturers interested in the electrification of the textile industry attended the technical session on applications in the textile industry, January 30, at the winter meeting. This was the first time in the history of the AIEE that a session was devoted to the problems of electric equipment in the textile industry. The meeting was presided over by Philip Bliss (M '45) of New Britain, Conn., who is with the Raymond Engineering Laboratories, Middletown, Conn."
"Lists various society-based activities and events that may be of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"Silicones, portable testing devices, and induction heating were among the most popular of the 65 exhibits and demonstrations at the Electrical Engineering Exposition held in the 71st Regiment Armory, New York, N. Y., concurrently with the AIEE winter meeting. A transmission line construction truck built to carry tools, supplies, and equipment for power line construction also was a prominent feature of the exposition, which was said to be especially successful from the viewpoint of personal interviews with manufacturers and the widening of personal contacts."
"News, events, meetings and announcements from other societies that may be of interest to electrical engineers, practitioners and researchers."
"The following new books are among those recently received at the Engineering Societies Library. Unless otherwise specified, books listed have been presented by the publishers. The Institute assumes no responsibility for statements made in the following summaries, information for which is taken from the prefaces of the books in question."

"Aircraft in flight are capable of building up extremely high potentials which, in discharging, interfere with radio communication and navigation equipment, perhaps to such an extent as to render it useless for long periods. The process by which electrification is accumulated and the mechanism by which radio interference is produced are described in this first part of a 2-part article."
"The inadequacies of certain methods of grounding of instrument transformer secondary circuits have been studied by the AIEE relay subcommittee. Multi- and singlepoint grounding have been considered both pro and con. Preferred practices for grounding these circuits are recommended by this subcommittee, which is composed of engineers who have had vast experience with the subject matter."
"The National Electrical Manufacturers Association, a nonprofit trade association supported by manufacturers of electric equipment, has developed a standardization plan for fractional-horsepower motors (EE, Nov '46, p 541). The purpose of the new standards is to improve the quality, reliability, and life of small-power motors."
"The present acute shortage of engineers caused by the United States' selective service policy during World War II is currently of much concern to the profession. Although it is probable that it will be at least five years before the condition is corrected, the situation can be alleviated somewhat by intelligent co-operation among the main competitors for the available supply of qualified engineers—industry, research, and education."
"The PCC streetcar is a result of a co-operative research program started in 1929 by the “Electric Railway Presidents' Conference Committee.” The committee was formed because rising costs and declining revenues demanded standardization so that mass production of cars and their equipment could effect lower prices and higher quality."
"The first rural party-line telephone service utilizing radio installations operating on the subscribers' premises was undertaken experimentally in the vicinity of Cheyenne Wells, near the eastern border of Colorado. Radio links have been used to supply regular telephone service to eight ranches since August 20, 1946. The development of a standard rural radiotelephone system will be aided materially by the experience gained from these experiments."
"Standardization of electric equipment marking is of vital interest to technicians who must install and operate the apparatus. Although many standards have been formulated, more are needed and those that do exist require greater utilization∗ During World War II it was brought out that existing standards do not encompass the field of name plate marking, and at that time there was a vital need for such a practice."
"A new method of printing wiring and circuit components on an insulated surface, developed by the National Bureau of Standards in co-operation with electronic manufacturers for the tiny generator-powered radio proximity fuse, is applicable in the design of devices where extreme ruggedness and small size are imperative. The principal effect of the printing methods, which include hand spraying and photography, is to reduce electronic circuit wiring to two dimensions. Illustrated is a size comparison between a conventional 2-stage amplifier and a miniature amplifier for use with subminiature tubes. Their characteristics are identical."
"In the brief period often years the 3,600-rpm turbine generator has so grown in ratings that it has driven, in effect, the slower speed 4-pole generating unit from tlie central-station field except for the largest capacity installations. But here, too, the death knell is being sounded by the construction of a 100,000-kw 3,600-rpm unit that will operate with steam at 1,500 pounds per square inch gauge pressure and 1,050 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest inlet temperature yet attempted."
"The vast influx of reports on new and not easily understood developments in the various fields of electronics easily can be quite baffling to the electrical engineer. An understanding, such as is provided here, of recent expansion in electronics research is helpful to give the correct perspective with which to view the electrical industry."
"Physical integration of all t h e control elements normally associated with a d-c generator is the object of this proposed electric system. With a carbon pile regulator as the basic element, the other necessary elements are added to produce a relatively simple but dependable system."
"The elementary electronics circuits familiar to radar men are not limited to one field, as is shown by this description of a typical industrial electronics application. Ultrahigh frequency techniques are described as used for register control in the printing and paper industries."
"Transient and steady-state performance of all standard rotating machinery used industrially can be determined by analyzing one generalized machine, the so-called “primitive machine.” The tensorial method enables the engineer to ignore the internal processes of the rotating machine and to concentrate his attention upon the easily visualized external interconnection of the windings. The equivalent circuit of the primitive rotating machine with asymmetrical stator and rotor is derived using this method."
"MULTIPLEX BROADCASTING is the simultaneous transmission of several programs from a single transmitter and antenna. This system is of timely interest as it offers a logical solution to some of the difficulties encountered as future broadcast channel allocations are forced toward the microwave region of the radio spectrum."
"The only continuous time signal service is provided to the world by the National Bureau of Standards. One or more of the broadcast frequencies (5, 10, and 15 megacycles per second and 2.5 megacycles at night) is being used continuously. A crystal clock, utilizing electronic circuits instead of the conventional clock mechanisms, has been developed to insure accuracies to within a microsecond for use in navigation, seismology, and geological surveys. The flawless quartz crystal, the heart of the circuit, has a resonance frequency of approximately 100,000 or 200,000 cycles per second, and is sealed in a glass or metal enclosure to insure against variations in pressure and humidity."
"Silicones now are available in commercial quantities as fluids for use in hydraulic devices, as lubricating oils, as liquid dielectrics, in high vacuum diffusion pumps; silicone compounds for waterproof insulation in ignition systems and high-frequency communications equipment; greases for very high and very low temperature lubrication; “rubber” for heat-resistant gaskets, diaphragms, tubing, electrical insulation; various resins for insulation, protective coatings, bonding agents for inorganic laminations. This new “continent” in the world of industrial chemistry has extended enormously the known boundaries and opened many new areas for exploration."
"This report presents and analyzes the results of a preliminary survey of employer practice regarding engineering graduates which was undertaken by a subcommittee of the Engineers Joint Council in conjunction with a series of studies and surveys being carried on by the EJC and its constituent societies pertaining to the economic status of the engineer."
"As one of his first steps in acquainting the AIEE membership with the current status of AIEE action on the board of directors' resolution endorsing amendment of the National Labor Relation Acts insofar as it affects engineers, and as a means of coalescing membership opinion, AIEE President J. E. Housley addressed the following letter to all Institute officers on February 7."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The Worcester Section will be host to a 3-day meeting of the North Eastern District and a Student Branch conference, April 23–25, 1947. Meeting headquarters will be the Hotel Sheraton, located on the common, in the heart of the city. A full program of technical sessions, built around the dominant theme, “applications engineering,” combined with an interesting program for women, social events, a lively general session, and several excellent inspection trips all point to a very worthwhile meeting."
"From Rhode Island to California tribute was paid to the “wizard of Menlo Park” on the 100th anniversary of his birthday, February 11, by leaders of every walk of life, by others who had known Thomas Alva Edison in life, and especially by men of the electrical industry, who so well personify the truth of one speaker's reminder that “you would not be holding the position you hold, … would not be living the life you are living … if it were not for this man.”"
"To bring prices into line with rising production and paper costs, a revision of prices for advance pamphlet copies of author's manuscripts of technical papers will become effective with the 1947 North Eastern District meeting papers; S. M. Anson, finance."
"Some 1,450 AIEE members have expressed opinions and preferences for the type of organization which best would enable the engineering profession to disseminate technical information, to render a greater service to society, to maintain professional standards, and to enhance the public esteem and recognition of engineers. This survey has been completed and is published because of widely expressed interest in its outcome."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"The Engineering Societies Library has followed up its 1945 reading list for engineers (EE, Mar '46, pp 139–40) with a list of what it considers important books of interest to electrical engineers which have been published in 1946."
"After a lapse of five years, Eta Kappa Nu will resume the granting of Recognition Awards to outstanding young electrical engineers."
"Current studies of the moon as a passive repeater making possible world-wide microswave communication were revealed by D. D. Grieg (A '39) in a closing session of the 1947 annual convention of the Institute of Radio Engineers held March 3–6, in the Hotel Commodore, New York, N. Y., with a registered attendance of 12,549. In addition, as a service to its members, the IRE sponsored a Radio Engineering Show at the Grand Central Palace in New York at which 170 manufacturers exhibited their products."
"News, events, meetings and announcements from other societies that may be of interest to electrical engineers, practitioners and researchers."

"Field tests of carrier telephony on power lines were conducted in the rural districts near Jonesboro, Ark., and Selma, Ala., during the early part of 1946. Operating experience obtained from these installations has enabled the development of a commercial rural carrier system for application on power lines and telephones. Several such systems are now in operation and others are being installed."
"As an adjustable speed drive the electronic constant-current motor system has the same characteristics as the variable voltage system but with a minimum complement of power tubes. Its constant torque characteristics simplify its use for certain classes of application, such as maintenance of tension. These installations range in size from 1/4 horsepower to 7 1/2 horsepower and have a definite advantage in use with electronic control."
"Equipment for the XY switch, employed in a step-by-step dial telephone system, is light in weight and requires little floor space. Its package-type unit allows for exchange growth and standardization. Greater convenience in locating the called contacts as well as simplicity of circuits are offered. Only those switches required to accomodate the traffic need be mounted at the time of installation, with additional ones added as the traffic increases."
"This electrical essay is presented for the recreation of the reader. The author's challenge is: Can you find the error in the reasoning accompanying the following example?"
"The history of measurements is the history of civilization. As man has become able to measure more accurately, he has been able to manufacture more intricate and accurate mechanisms. The use of electric circuits for determining and controlling the quality of products produced by industry has just begun. There remain many problems to be solved; but electric gauges already have proved themselves to be a major advancement in the science of measurements and quality control."
"The methods of analysis and calculations outlined for a small brass-slab rolling mill can be applied to other installations. The time and money spent selecting the proper motor size saves extravagance in first cost, maintenance, and power factor correction."
"The largest Diesel-electric locomotive to be built in a single unit recently has been placed in service. Each of the eight driving axles has its own traction motor. As a result the same locomotive may be used economically in either high-speed passenger service or freight service in mountainous territory by changing the traction motor gearing, a simple shop job."
"A method of separating isotopes by counter-current electromigration has been developed by the National Bureau of Standards in connection with work on the natural isotopes of potassium and chloride. This method makes use of the difference in the ionic mobilities of the isotopes of an element, and has been developed to a point where it can be used as a practical means of separating not only isotopes, but ionic species in general."
"In the preceding companion article, the inescapable tendency of an airplane in flight to accumulate relatively heavy electrostatic charge was discussed, with especial reference to loss of communication through resulting radio interferences. In this concluding part, several types of devices for dissipating the static charges on aircraft are described and comparisons given by test results. It is shown that metallic bristles with chemically etched points may be applied so as to bleed off the charges as they form, and thus obviate radio interference and other attendant hazards to a degree heretofore not attained."
"Several main aircraft engine-driven alternators can be operated in parallel by using an electronic frequency changer with each alternator and paralleling the outputs of the changers at the load bus. A mechanical constant- speed drive for each generator is then unnecessary."
"The isolation of only one phase wire in a single-phase-to-ground fault enables the use of longer reclosing times without endangering system stability. Several years of operating experience results in a favorable comparison between single- and 3-pole reclosing."
"In answer to increasing demand for a system of designating electrical frequency bands, a joint technical committee on standard frequency bands and designations has considered a number of methods of which the most desirable seems to be a “decade frequency system” based on powers of ten. This article describing the decade frequency system was prepared by the committee primarily for the purpose of obtaining comments and suggestions."
"Although the number of pole fires is small relative to the total number of circuit-poleyears, the resulting damage and service interruption make their prevention of prime importance."
"The 2-for 1 twister produces higher quality yarn in about half the time and with a third the power required by conventional machines. The use of electric machinery reduces the number of rejections of finished fabrics necessary because of dirty yarn and increases the uniformity of twist in the yarn. Power consumption and quality of product are independent of the size of the supply package and the amount of yarn on the take-up spool."
"Television networks, like sound broadcasting networks, must be available to make distribution of high quality programs economical. For television circuits interconnecting studios in different cities, coaxial cable and radio relay are the most suitable methods. For short distance transmission balanced wire pairs also may be used. Local conditions will control the type circuit selected."
"According to a recent announcement of the National Bureau of Standards, new ceramic dielectrics having exceptionally high dielectric constants have been evolved. Such dielectrics are important in the production of capacitors for use in radio, radar, and television, and for the tiny capacitors required in subminiature electronic devices."
"DURING the war years the development of new designs, new machines, new methods, and processes to meet customers' demands for better service and higher quality products was accelerated far beyond any previous advancement. These new developments, as well as the rise of standardization and interchangeability of parts requiring stricter tolerance conformance, have accelerated, of necessity, the development of the statistical method of controlling quality."
"THE term “quality control” when reduced to its elements may be defined as the exercise of directive, guiding, or restraining action over the characteristics of an article or more specifically a product in process of manufacture or after completion."
"The design and construction of single phase a-c magnets is a subject about which little has been published although these magnets possess several advantages over d-c magnets. The problems which confront a designer in this field are collected and considered in this article."
"A gas turbine electric locomotive is to be designed and built at Baden, Switzerland, for the Great Western Railway. The order for the locomotive has been placed with the British Brown-Boveri, Ltd."
"For the 62d annual summer general meeting of the AIEE, to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, June 9–13, 1947, the summer general meeting committee has planned a program of entertainment, inspection trips, and recreation, in addition to the excellent technical sessions, which should make the meeting attractive as a vacation, as well as of benefit professionally. Meeting headquarters will be at the Mount Royal Hotel, located in the heart of the city."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The first available sections of 1947 AIEE PROCEEDINGS have been mailed to those members who placed orders for them, and distribution of other sections is proceeding as rapidly as printing can be completed. PROCEEDINGS sections are being published in pamphlet form, each pamphlet comprising a technical paper with its related discussion, if any."
"The annual meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers will be held at the Mount Royal Hotel, Montreal, Canada, at 10 a.m., Wednesday, June 11, 1947."
"The Midwest general meeting will be held November 3–7, 1947, with headquarters at the Congress Hotel, and the National Electronics Conference will be held November 3–5, with headquarters in the Edgewater Beach Hotel, both in Chicago, 111. Overlap of the two meetings was arranged in order that people interested in subjects on both programs could avoid traveling to two meetings at different times."
"A strong tide of interest is running in engineering circles concerning the economic and public status of the profession. Many engineers, particularly our younger men, are outspoken in the opinion that the agencies which have served us so well in advancing the science and art of engineering are ill-adapted to cope with the problems and interests we face in common. The subcommittee on professional activities, appointed in 1945 by the Institute's committee on planning and co-ordination, presents here an extensive sampling of opinion among electrical engineers as to the best means of remedying this situation."
"Lists various society-based activities and events that may be of interest to practitioners and researchers."

"One of the war's great costs to the United States is turning out to be in the basic materials that support the nation's strength according to a series of official reports bringing to light the real extent of cost in resources. Julius A. Krug, Secretary of Interior, is suggesting a $1,000,000 survey to determine exactly how much mineral wealth is left. The United States Forestry Service is recommending tighter rules on the use of timber resources."

"The life of Thomas A. Edison, whose 100th anniversary is being observed this year, truly embodies the spirit of “The electrical engineer” for his contributions have stimulated almost every phase of electrical activity. To men such as Edison and his cofounders of the AIEE, to men whose accomplishments have been deemed worthy of recognition, and to every electrical engineer who simply serves faithfully, the world owes much of its comfort, its efficiency, and its well-being."
"View of the core and coils of one of the highest voltage mobile substations ever built, constructed by the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company for the United States Department of Interior, Bonneville, Oreg. Tap changing mechanism provides low voltages from 2.4 kv to 13.8 kv from a 31-kv to 110-kv 3-phase line. Delta and Y connections are provided together with 4 plus 2 1/2 and 6 minus 2 1/2 per cent voltage taps. The forced-oil-cooled transformer together with high and low voltage switchgear will be trailer-mounted to provide a 2,500-kva emergency tie-in substation for a large West coast network. At the left is shown the low voltage side and at the right the high voltage side of the horizontally mounted unit"
"Because they are inherent in the structure of matter, electrostatic phenomena were noted and recorded even in ancient times. However, neglect of their practical application to the generation and utilization of electric power has resulted from the slow development of insulating media. From this viewpoint, the author examines the voltageinsulating qualities of compressed gases and high vacuum and the prospects for obtaining compact machinery so insulated."
"A new 15-pound mechanically commutated telemetering system developed by the General Electric Company and designed for use with rockets speeding at 3,800 miles per hour recently was tested successfully at the United States Army Ordnance Proving Ground, White Sands, N. Mex. The system uses only ten electronic tubes and is packaged in two pressurized cans, each four inches in diameter and 12 and 15 inches long. Power is supplied by a separate 28-volt battery, located in the control compartment, which weighs 12 pounds. Every 1/35 of a second 28 items are sent by the 5-watt transmitter in the rocket and are received at the ground station where they are recorded permanently on film from one cathode ray oscilloscope."
"How should the 5-year engineering college program be apportioned among the many subjects contending for the student's time at every level of his training? To date this question has been sidestepped even by proponents of the “5-year plan.” With the 5-year program already adopted in some institutions, as recommended by ASEE, the question moves into the forefront of the battle currently waging over engineering curriculums. One of the first to enter the field with a comprehensive philosophy on which decisive action can be based, the author nevertheless leaves several problems in abeyance, pending further study by the psychologists."
"Completely underground facilities constitute one of the most effective means for protecting aircraft production against air attacks of the type employed during World War II. This conclusion has been reached by the Air Materiel Command which, acting for the United States Army Air Forces, currently is studying German underground industrialization."
"The transformer-loss compensator is proposed as an economical answer to the problem of metering on the low-voltage side of the transformer, where supplying and billing for energy and demand must be done at distribution or transmission voltages. Use of the compensator, an accessory to the regular watt-hour meter, necessitates no changes in the meter, and its accuracy has equaled that of meters on the high-voltage side."
"A review of the problems confronting the engineer who must improve the operating efficiency of his hydro plants is presented because worth-while saving to the operating company often can be suggested by the hydraulic turbine manufacturer."
"Fluorescent lighting, improved riding qualities, smoother acceleration and deceleration, and noise reduction are some of the numerous improvements incorporated in the new subway cars for New York City. The subway commuter will derive greater comfort and cleanliness from thermostatic heat control, an increased quantity of horizontal fans per car, plastic seat coverings, and wider aisles."
"This new method of single-side-band generation is based on the frequency addition principle. Apparatus consists of linear modulators combined with wide-range phase-splitting circuits to produce the signals."
"A practical summarization of the factors affecting interconnected operation is presented which shows that the interest of management, adequate organization, careful planning, and correct procedures are the essential elements contributing toward successful interconnection."
"Though not perfected for field use, the vacuum tube acceleration pickup has several peculiar advantages which will facilitate many types of acceleration experimentation. These potentialities encourage further development of the tube."
"Beyond the facts that they recur in welldefined cycles and that they affect certain of the earth's latitudes more than others, little but theoretical knowledge exists about the nature of sunspots and the sometimes concomitant magnetic storms. However, almost inadvertently, modern telegraph systems are being immunized against them by such innovations as carrier currents and radio relay systems which avoid the effects of earthcurrent disturbances."
"A third and somewhat different approach to the subject of fundamental physical concepts and the related theories is offered to assist engineers in a better understanding of the Newton and Einstein laws and their applications in the field of physics. This is a continuation of the discussion presented in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, January 1947, pages 45–66."
"WHENEVER a fault in a transformer is beginning to form, heat is produced locally, which begins to decompose solid or liquid insulating material and, consequently, to produce inflammable gas. This fact has led to the development of gas-actuated relays for transformer fault protection. Such relays have been in use abroad for many years, and more recently in Canada, but the applications in the United States have been negligible. Small faults develop only slight amounts of gas per time unit. Severe faults, however, quickly develop large amounts of gas and rapidly increase pressure inside the tank. The gas-actuated relays contain two elements: one is a highly sensitive gas-element which operates if gas is developed slowly and which indicates the faults in their incipient stage; the other is a quickly acting pressure element which operates the circuit breakers of the transformer when faults are grave. The experiences have been very good, and the early indications of faults in their incipient stage have reduced greatly the time for, and cost of, repairs. The sensitivity of the gas-actuated relays is considerably greater than that of any type of electrical transformer protection because of the extremely sensitive gas-element which is an important part of the protection. The gas-actuated relay is a simple and economical protective device which also can be applied to special transformers in which electrical methods are complicated, expensive, of very reduced sensitivity, and, therefore, of limited protective value."
"The development of electronic heating, both induction and dielectric, has made possible many applications which were impossible with conventional methods of heating. However, the radiation which may be produced by electronic heating equipment can interfere seriously with radio communications, thus posing a problem for both industry and the Federal Communications Commission. The findings of the AIEE subcommittee on electronic heating, which was formed to study the situation, are reported in this article."
"The aviation industry has found numerous applications for high-speed squirrel cage motors to operate over a wide speed range. Elaborate power supply systems have been developed to provide the required range and accuracy of motor speed control. Applications of the systems probably will be found in other industries."
"The background of the “status quo” in standardization of this youngest offspring of communications is reviewed, and the contributions of the NTSC, the RTPB, and wartime developments evaluated. In outlining the immediate future of television, due consideration is given to commercial problems, and predictions are hazarded about the course color television will follow in view of the recent FCC decision."
"All preparations have been completed for the AIEE summer general meeting, which will be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, June 9–13. Meeting headquarters will be in the Mount Royal Hotel. A program of broad technical interest, providing ample opportunity for entertainment, trips, and sports, as well as interesting events for women visitors, has been arranged. The technical program, together with a schedule of entertainment, sports, and trips, appears in this issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. For more detailed information about the various events, as well as hotel accommodations and reservations see ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, May 1947, pages 493–5."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"North Eastern District and summer general meeting papers are included in the second AIEE PROCEEDINGS order form which appears on pages 55A-56A of this issue. This new series of publications, designed for the specialist to whom early availability of the full text of technical papers is of special importance, constitutes a special service to AIEE members and is not available for general distribution. Details of the current AIEE publications policy in this regard are given in the January issue on page 82."
"At its regular meeting held April 23, 1947, in Worcester, Mass., the AIEE board of directors authorized the president to appoint a special committee on legislation to assist him in the attempt to effect a satisfactory revision of the National Labor Relations Act. The board thus rescinded its limiting January resolution to conform to the majority opinion expressed in the recent poll of AIEE membership, which favored exemption of engineers from the collective bargaining provisions of the NLRA."
"With a verified registration of 828 persons, the AIEE North Eastern District meeting held in Worcester, Mass., April 23–25, 1947, established a new all-time high record for such meetings in that District. The District meeting idea originated in that District 23 years ago. Detailed statistics are given in accompanying tabulations. This Worcester meeting is the second largest of any AIEE District meetings, being exceeded only by the 900 recorded for the Great Lakes District meeting in Chicago, 111., in 1927."

"The potential value of atomic energy to industry is currently the subject of much speculation. An evaluation of the situation indicates that although atomic energy is not producing commercially useful power as yet, such production is technically possible. However, it is likely that by-products of atomic energy such as radioactive isotopes and fission products will prove of more immediate importance to society."
"The band theory of solids is capable of explaining such fundamental properties of electronic semiconductors as the dependency of specific resistance on impurity content, the negative temperature coefficient of resistance, the sign of the Hall and thermoelectric effects, and the direction of rectification. Measurements of the specific resistance and the Hall constant enable the calculation of density, mobility, and mean free path of the electric carriers as a function of temperature and impurity."
"The electromagnetic dynamometer and slip-coupling units are a valuable aid in many motor applications. Though of relatively recent development this machinery has found application in the automotive industry, aircraft testing, ship propulsion, and with punch presses."
"Naval electric power equipment, as well as commercial machines, may be reduced in size and weight by the development of new silicone insulating materials. Tests are still in progress which indicate that fire and arc resisting products will be obtained that can also meet other Navy specifications."
"Radiations from exploding atoms are counted at the rate of 100,000 each second by a radiation detector developed by the Westinghouse Research Laboratories. The new detector is said to be 50 times more effective than the standard Geiger counter whose limit is about 2,000 radiations per second."
"The K2 telephone cable carrier system is providing dependable long distance communication with improved performance at reduced cost, saving in raw materials. The portable testing equipment developed for use on the K2 system also can be used to test the K1 system and certain open wire channels."
"A method of X-raying oil fields by remote operation from its research laboratories has been developed by Gulf Oil Corporation. The new development helps solve the riddle of how oil flows through the sand and rocks under any particular field, and how it is affected by underground water and gas."
"Co-operation among the electrical utility, the welding equipment manufacturer, and the industrial user is the prime condition for a satisfactory solution to the power supply problem in the resistance welding field. A discussion of one method of approach to the problem is presented as a contribution to the promotion of mutual understanding among the parties concerned."
"Though the cotton industry ranks among the oldest in the United States, its adoption of electric power has been a fairly recent development, perhaps because long-time use had brought mechanical power to a high degree of refinement. The extent to which electric power has infiltrated cotton manufacturing processes is described here."
"The development of electric power distribution and utilization is not complete although great strides have been made since the days of water wheels. The cotton textile industry continuously is adapting new methods and discoveries to the improvement of production and replacement of existing facilities."
"New manufacturing techniques have made possible a practical axial-air-gap motor which offers several advantages as to size and weight. Various construction problems were encountered in the production. The motor is primarily a flange-mounted machine which is particularly adaptable to machine tools and gear units. Simplicity and speed of inspection, cleaning, and lubrication are claimed for the motor."
"The need for more complete data on the performance of wood, both in regard to impulse and power-frequency operation, has been recognized for some time. Although certain fundamental data are still lacking, much has been learned from laboratory tests about the use of wood as an insulating material. The economic importance of wood-pole line makes these test data valuable assets in the consideration of materials for high-voltage installations."
"The cathode-ray oscilloscope and associated equipment can be used for the quantitative determination of magnetic properties without compensation for end effects. This equipment provides a method not only for obtaining core loss and permeability, but also for obtaining retentivity and coercive force and degree of saturation of the test specimen."
"Developed under the impetus of the submarine menace of World War II, the airborne magnetometer has found many peacetime uses. Navy airplanes equipped with magnetometers for exploration of Antarctica were used in the recent United States Navy expedition. An expedition now is studying the Aleutian Alaskan volcanos and the Aleutian submarine trench. From there it will proceed to Hawaii and Bikini."
"Thirty-three impurity elements, some in concentrations as low as one part in 20 million, have been detected and estimated through a modified spectrographic method developed at the National Bureau of Standards and used since 1942 in the Manhattan Project for analysis of uranium and its compounds."
"Developments in light sources since and before World War II have been extensive, and the effect of light on the total field of view of human vision is being considered more and more in artificial illumination. Incandescent light sources, which include arc and filament lamps, and vapor discharge sources, which include metallic vapor discharge and hot- and cold-cathode fluorescent lamps, have many different characteristics which make them suitable for various applications, but no one type of lamp is suited for all purposes."
"Automatic dynamic braking in event of power failure for two d-c series motors can be accomplished in several ways. The method will be determined by service requirements."
"The simplification stated by Ohm's law — resistance is the ratio of potential to current — is qualified for insulation materials. The current quantity is shown to be a superposition of four more or less independent components, each with different characteristics. This approach produces a method for eliminating common errors and inaccuracies from insulation resistance measurements."
"Phosphors may be produced which store energy from X rays, beta rays, gamma rays, and visible light, and which hold this energy for indefinite periods of time. The energy is released, in the form of light varying from red to ultraviolet, by infrared radiation with speed of release governed by intensity of the infrared radiation."
"The AIEE San Diego Section, host for the Pacific general meeting to be held in San Diego, Calif., August 26–29, 1947, is making the theme of its invitation, “Plan your vacation for the dates of the meeting and stay around as long as you can.” Headquarters for the meeting will be in the San Diego Hotel. An attractive program of entertainment, sports, and trips, with special features for the visiting women, has been arranged. A tentative schedule of events was published in the June issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (p 596)."

"In pursuance of decisions of the International Committee on Weights and Measures, the National Bureau of Standards will introduce as of January 1, 1948, revised values of the units of electricity and of light. While the definitions of the units and the methods of fixing their magnitudes will be quite different from those of the present practical systems, the changes in magnitude will be so small as to affect appreciably only measurements of high precision. In certificates for standards and instruments issued by the Bureau during 1947 values will be given in both the old and the new units."

"PRESENTATION of the Lamme Medal for 1946 to John Bayfield MacNeill (F '42) manager of the switchgear and control division of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, was made June 11, 1947, during the AIEE summer general meeting at Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Mr. MacNeill was awarded the medal “for his foresight, leadership, and creative contribution in the development of switching equipment.” The award has been made each year since 1928 to an engineer “who has shown meritorious achievement in the development of electrical apparatus or machinery.”"
"THE GROWTH of almost every great industry rests upon the progressive development of one or more key auxiliaries, devices, or processes vital to its functioning. As an example, the railroads have the air brake and the block signal without which modern high-speed railway trains could not be operated."
"THE GREAT GROWTH of power generation in the United States and Canada has imposed problems of control through switching operations that at times have seemed impractical, and the general progress in this phase of the industry seems to justify comment. With few exceptions our large systems, in contrast to continental European practice, are grounded, and line-to-ground faults become short circuits in which flow many times the normal power and which therefore must be removed instantly. As most high voltage lines are overhead and lightning over large areas of the United States is severe, the duty on switches and circuit breakers from such faults is frequently heavy. Moreover, as most line flashovers will clear themselves in a few cycles if the power flow is removed, we have resorted to fast reclosure, both single and polyphase, as well as to fast interruption, to maintain stable operation at high loads with a minimum number of transmission circuits and with heavy bus concentrations of generators. This is obvious to power engineers and is the basis for the necessity that American switchgear perform under heavy and frequent duty with absolute reliability. The improvement in this respect in recent years has contributed much to the continuity of electrical service and to its low cost, and is a tribute to the men who have worked, often under difficult conditions, with the abstruse phenomena involved. It is more than chance that five of the last six Lamme Medal recipients have been identified with important switchgear developments. In accepting the present award I wish to stress the broad co-operative effort in the industry on the part of many capable engineers, both in utilities and manufacturing, who have furthered this advance."
"THE FACT that we properly can use the inclusive term “defense of North America” is significant, for it symbolizes the very remarkable position which has come about in the development of friendly and close relations between the nations of the North American continent; the words themselves betoken the fact that today within North America there are no frontiers in the sense of separating boundaries between nations that have to be fortified and patrolled by armed forces on guard against some ever-present or potential risk of invasion or other military action. On the contrary, the boundaries between nations within the continent of North America are interlaced with open highways where great friendly peoples meet in free and peaceful intercourse for trade and commerce and to develop associations and enterprises which redound to their mutual advantage and benefit."
"In 1944 two Russian physicists, D. Iwanenko and I. Pomeranchuk, pointed out that radiation should come from the electrons moving in circular orbits in a betatron. This effect, they said, would impose a limit on the simple betatron. At more than approximately 100 million volts, the electrons would radiate energy as fast as they received it unless proper compensation were made."
"Piezoelectricity means “pressure electricity.” It refers to those electrical effects produced when certain crystals are compressed, and conversely, to the deformation of crystals in an electric field. Several hundred different crystals have been found to be piezoelectric, but the only ones that are of present practical importance are natural crystals of quartz and tourmaline, and artificial crystals of Rochelle salt and ammonium phosphate. Important uses of these crystals are described."
"Metallic rectifier power packs have been in operation for about 18 months at the Buffalo, N. Y., plant of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The rectifier units fill the need for supplying d-c power for small d-c motors in scattered areas, and are claimed to have lower cost and higher efficiency than motor generator sets, with easier mounting and simplified maintenance."
"Transmission on long nonloaded submarine telegraph cables has been improved by application of efficient signal-shaping amplifiers, replacement of electromechanical receiving equipment, use of new artificial line networks and new methods of balancing, and increased sending voltages. With these improvements it became practicable to change from cable code recorder operation to printer operation and, at the same time, to obtain higher quality of transmission at increased speeds."
"The complexity of the diagram of Standards committee procedures indicates that it is one of the busiest of AIEE committees. That it is one of the most far reaching in influence is apparent from this concise assessment of the magnitude of the committee's task in promoting uniform and sound engineering standards governing the applications of electricity."
"System faults impose a great variety of short circuits on the windings of 3-winding transformers. Unfortunately, the present American Standard (C57) on short circuits is inadequate and subject to misinterpretation, particularly in the case of line-to-ground faults on Y-connected windings of transformers provided with delta-connected stabilizing windings."
"Many metallurgical manufacturers in Canada have taken advantage of the tremendous hydroelectric developments there which provide an abundance of low-cost electric power. Fuel combustion heat is being replaced by electric heat for such processes as annealing and wire patenting, and more electric power is being used in induction heating for forging and hardening, regulation of smelting furnaces, and in electric arc furnaces. Electric heat has allowed short time cycles, automatic operation, and has provided uniform results consistently."
"For years it has been common practice in the rubber industry to add carbon black to rubber in order to improve mechanical properties such as increasing the wear resistance and strength. The United States Rubber Company now is utilizing the properties of carbon as an electric conductor in making a rubber product designed to carry current"
"Wide speed-range operation is essential for vehicular generating systems, and only d-c machines have been practical to date. An alternator-rectifier system with high output and efficiency comparable with the d-c system is presented."
"Task Force “Frost” operations during the months of January and February 1947 at Camp McCoy, Wis., were observed by representatives of several companies. Purpose of the task force was to service test items of equipment under heavy winter and simulated combat conditions. Observations and recommendations for improvement of the equipment tested are included."
"The combination of a gaseous tube rectifier and a d-c motor recently has become quite popular, often with disastrous consequences for the gaseous tube. Behavior of a d-c motor is in many respects equivalent to that of a very large capacitor. An engineer aware of the severe conditions imposed on a gaseous rectifier feeding into a capacitor input filter, may connect a d-c motor to a gaseous rectifier, not realizing he may be imposing worse conditions than is the case with a capacitor."
"This treatment of electrical hazards endeavors to rectify the condition of scanty, incomplete information or misinformation that is too common among a people experiencing greater and greater electrification of their home and industrial equipment. The behavior of electric currents and charges that makes for electrical hazards, what the accident statistics reveal, the physiological effects of electric shock and how it can be treated, all are included."
"Comparatively few writers have dealt with the economic problem in transmitting power long distances. In this analysis important possible variations in cost were studied and considered carefully in order to test the validity of the conclusions which were drawn. The effect of these variations tempered the conclusions which are presented here."
"As time goes, it was not too long ago that America's pioneer plowman carried a musket as standard equipment. Today, we find the blueprint on the factory desk alongside the machine. The musket and the blueprint are, in many respects, similar symbols. Both have two implications — they are symbols of either destruction or security."
"First, I wish to express to all members of the Institute my appreciation of the great honor that has been conferred on me in my being elected your president for the ensuing year. The office is one of great distinction. We are 63 years old this year and number over 27,000 members, the largest engineering society in the world. Many renowned engineers have helped to fashion the Institute into what it is today — an important factor in the shaping of many of our ways of life. I indeed would be embarrassed by my personal inadequacies, did I not realize that the success of the Institute depends not so much on the ability of the president or his activities, as upon the ability and activities of the thousands of members scattered over the continent who are willing to contribute so much to the success of the organization through their work in the Sections and the committees."
"All is in readiness for the AIEE Pacific general meeting to be held in San Diego, Calif., August 26–29, 1947. A varied program of entertainment, sports, and trips, with special features for the visiting women, combined with the recreational activities which San Diego has to offer, provides attractive vacation possibilities. Those who have not visited the city since before the war will find many interesting changes. The program committee suggests: “Plan your vacation for the dates of the meeting and stay around as long as you can.” Headquarters for the meeting will be in the Hotel San Diego."

"Doctor Compton develops the thesis that “wars between great powers are a thing of the past,” in considering the portent of man's control of atomic energy."
"In an address before a regional meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in Louisville, Ky., February 18, 1947, the essential substance of which appeared in Chemical Engineering Progress, June 1947, H. F. Willkie (Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.), decried the lack of co-ordinated research in the United States. To alleviate this condition, Mr. Willkie suggests that a post of secretary of research in the President's cabinet be set up. In summarizing the activities of a secretary of research, Mr. Willkie says:"
"Immediately after the close of World War II, the railroads began to order a large number of passenger cars in an effort to retain part of the passenger business that had come to them during the war years. As might have been expected, a large number of different ideas were given a quick try-out and adopted by different railroads. Many of these ideas had as their basis a very large increase in the amount of power which would be required for electric devices on the cars."
"Valuable new information about the atom, offering more detail in the invisible infrared spectrum than ever has been approached, is made possible by the development of a new type of spectrograph by Doctor Richard G. Nelson of the department of physics at the Northwestern University Technological Institute, Evanston, Ill."
"This report by Colonel Carey, chairman of the Engineers' Joint Council Committee on the 1946 Survey of the Engineering Profession, reviews the highlights of the EJC's 1946 survey which is entitled “The engineering profession in transition.” The survey is soon to be published and will be available for general sale at $1 per copy. It is a continuation of previous work which covered the years 1929 to 1934, the present survey covering the years 1939 through 1946. Three articles reporting various phases of the former survey were published in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING as follows: “Professional Aspects of Engineering Education,” (EE, Aug '36, pp 863–7); “Unemployment in the Engineering Profession,” (EE, Feb '37, pp 216–23); and “Employment in the Engineering Profession,” (EE, May '37, 524–31). Of particular interest in this latest study, restricted for the first time to persons identified through their membership in the six national professional engineering societies as being qualified members of the profession, are the comparisons afforded for 1939, 1943, and 1946, indicating the economic status of the engineer before, during, and after the war years. The participating societies in this survey are: AIEE, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, which make up the Engineers' Joint Council, and the National Society of Professional Engineers, joining in this project by invitation of EJC."
"The following electrical essay is presented for the recreation of the reader. The author's challenge is to determine whether these statements are true or false."
"Quebec, with an area of almost 600,000 square miles, is the largest province in the Dominion of Canada. Second only to Ontario in population and industrial development, it has no known deposits of coal or oil. Quebec owes its rapid industrial growth to its great hydroelectric power systems developed by private enterprise, although the government has made an important contribution through the work of the Quebec Streams Commission in constructing storage reservoirs."
"This 108,000-kw generator is one of seven built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for Grand Coulee Dam. Said to be the largest water wheel generators ever built, they are 45 feet in diameter, 32 feet in height, and weigh two million pounds"
"Sources of electric power may be divided into 11 major classifications. These classifications are outlined and briefly described herein."
"Frequency is independent of armature speed in an a-c generator described in this student paper. The generator operates on the principle of brush rotation. Several factors to be considered in aircraft generators are mentioned."
"Material shortages during World War II imposed limitations on the construction of new transmission facilities and the Bonneville Power Administration conducted tests to determine minimum construction standards. Conductor diameter and spacing and insulation level involving losses, flashovers, safety to personnel working on energized lines, economic loading, and radio interference had to be considered."
"One of the most closely guarded technical secrets of World War II, the proximity fuse was developed to counteract the natural defenses of both the airplane and the infantry. This review of the conception, the construction, and use of the fuse reveals how almost 100 per cent accuracy was built into the artillery of the Allies in World War II."
"Basic design considerations are analyzed for power supplies with unusually low internal impedance and low output ripple, an aspect of the larger subject of voltage-regulated supplies which the author believes has been lacking clarification."
"A widespread belief prevails among power system engineers that the problems of planning modern power system expansion are not solvable practically except with the aid of an analyzer. Certain principles and methods to facilitate the handling of problems of power flow networks make machine computation appear more feasible than the analyzer solution."
"Mathematical physicists like Einstein and Schroedinger have been trying for some time to develop a single grand formula to unit gravitation, light, magnetism, and electricity. Back in 1891, Arthur Schuster suspected that every large rotating mass was a magnet. Michael Faraday conducted many experiments to show that light could be inflexed by magnetism and other forces, but failed. Regarding gravity, he wrote in his diary: “Surely this force must be capable of an experimental relation to electricity, magnetism, and other forces, so as to bind it up with them in reciprocal action and equivalent effect.”"
"In the application of dielectric heating to various industrial processes, alternating frequencies between 1 and 30 megacycles, and rates of temperature rise of 50 degrees Fahrenheit and upward, are common. The measurement of the dielectric properties of a material under such varying conditions presents a problem which may be solved by a calorimetric substitution method."
"THIS REPORT gives the results of aging tests conducted by four co-operating laboratory groups of the General Electric Company, Pittsfield, Mass.; the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Sharon, Pa.; the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, Milwaukee, Wis.; and the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Ill."
"An interesting historical survey of electrical happenings in the 47th year of earlier centuries appears in the January 10, 1947, issue of the English magazine Electrical Review. Many events of interest to electrical engineers occurred in earlier '47's. In 1647, for example, Otto von Guericke constructed the first electric machine, which consisted of a globe of sulphur, cast in a glass sphere (which afterwards was broken to remove the sulphur globe). With this primitive machine, its inventor, in the words of Humboldt, “heard the first sound, and saw the first light, in artificially produced electricity.” A century later, Benjamin Franklin announced his theory of a single fluid, terming the vitreous electricity “positive” and the resinous “negative.” At a picnic in the following year he “killed a turkey by the electric spark, and roasted it by an electric jack before a fire kindled by the electric bottle.”"
"Trolley coaches and PCC streetcars established a high degree of availability and usefulness meeting World War II demands and have a definite economic field of application for city transit ranging from 500 to 12,000 maximum passengers per hour in one direction. They offer efficient use of city streets and reduction of traffic congestion."
"A new method of cleaning optical glass by electronic bombardment, developed by the Bausch and Lomb Optical Company, is reported in the Julyl 947 Compressed Air Magazine."
"The fundamentals involved in introducing signals into one medium and transmitting them through another are simplified in this review, so that the relationships between the many varieties of modulations attempted or in contemporary use are formed into a cohesive whole."
"TECHNICAL PAPERS previewed in this section will be presented at the AIEE Middle Eastern District meeting, Dayton, Ohio, September 23–25, 1947, and will be distributed in advance pamphlet form as soon as they become available.

"On July 31, 1947, the first length of 138-kv compression-type pipe cable was installed in the current Consolidated Edison Company of New York (N. Y.) Inc.'s extensive tie expansion program. The compression-type cable installation is the first commercial installation of its kind to be made in the United States. The tie program includes two 138-kv feeders between the Hudson Avenue generating station and a new distributing station at Jamaica, N. Y., and one 138-kv feeder between Jamaica and the Valley Stream, N. Y., substation of the Long Island Lighting Company."
"Doctor George D. Stoddard, new president of the University of Illinois, Urbana, Ill., and one of the nation's foremost educators, will deliver the keynote address at the National Electronics Conference which will be held at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, Chicago, Ill., on November 3–5, 1947. Walter Evans, vice-president of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, will speak at the Monday luncheon, and AIEE President Blake D. Hull will be present at the AIEE luncheon on Tuesday."
"Adelantos de Ingenieria, a new engineering quarterly which reprints selected articles from various engineering journals, was sent recently to the engineering societies and associations throughout Latin America.

"At the beginning of World War II, the overall operation of Germany's electrical utilities was taken over by government authority for the purpose of achieving maximum utilization of existing capacity through nation-wide interconnected operation. However, in spite of all efforts to the contrary, capacity slowly deteriorated, until the severe damage inflicted by Allied forces during the last month of the war led to the industry's almost complete collapse."
"THE use of the mercury-arc rectifier to supply large amounts of direct current required in electrochemical and electrometallurgical industries has received considerable impetus in the last several decades by many new installations by large companies. Operating experience and installation details as described by representatives of four companies provide interesting material for comparison."
"TOTAL rectifier connected load of the Arvida Works Aluminum Company of Canada, Ltd., is 747,000 kw. Of this total 174,000 kw is supplied by multianode tank rectifiers, and 573,000 kw is supplied by single anode per tank ignitrons. Each unit of all types is made up of one transformer, and two tanks — in the case of the multianode single tank type — or two frames in the case of the ignitron."
"CONSOLIDATED Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, Ltd., metallurgical and chemical plants, located at Trail, British Columbia, have a total load of 180,000 kw of which 80 per cent is converted to direct current for use in electrolytic processes. The first rectifier installation went into operation in 1929. Further installations have been added and now 70 per cent of the installed conversion equipment consists of mercury-arc rectifiers."
"PRODUCTION of 20,000 tons of coal daily is procured by the use of highly mechanized mining methods in the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. With the exception of main pumps used for mine drainage all underground equipment is operated from a 250-volt d-c grounded system. The total connected capacity of the conversion equipment at the company's five mines is 8,600 kw."
"To develop certain criteria of adequate protection, discover inherent limitations, and to recommend desirable devices and methods for protection of power transformers, the AIEE relay subcommittee conducted a survey of over 56,000,000 kva of power transformers. The final report is the result of almost three years of investigation by the working group."
"It is at least as large a step from hydrogen to liquid cooling as it was from air to hydrogen cooling of large turboalternators. A method of construction for liquid-cooled machines is difficult but the advantages to be gained by it are many and include improved temperature conditions, elimination of corona, and winding for higher voltages."
"An experimental light beam telegraph circuit which utilizes a concentrated-arc lamp has been in operation for more than three years over lower New York, N. Y. The 3/4-mile circuit has demonstrated that in fog-free localities dependable high quality communication is possible over light beam systems."
"The “electropult,” an unusual type of induction motor manufactured by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pa., is designed for launching airplanes that require long take-off runs from small landing fields without the high inertia impact imparted by other catapults. The secondary winding of the motor is the track of the catapult, and its primary winding is the car to which the airplane is harnessed."
"The name “Copperspun” describes a 1-piece squirrel-cage rotor cast of copper by a centrifugal process. Salient features of the rotor are: high strength, high melting point, no joints, low coefficient of expansion, high conductivity, low porosity, and improved dynamic balance."
"An extensive program for determining the effectiveness of concrete as a protective barrier against millionvolt wide-beam X rays is being conducted by scientists at the National Bureau of Standards. Optimum wall thicknesses and most desirable types of construction necessary for maximum short wave length X-ray protection are being investigated."
"Power ties to pulp and paper mills provide standby capacity for the mills, supply them with essential services during protracted shutdowns, and sometimes the tie can operate in reverse to the benefit of the utility. In regions where fuel is available at moderate cost, power ties are limited to carrying a marginal amount of power not available as by-products from process steam passing through mill turbines."
"This 100,000-kva transformer, product of the Westinghousc Electric Corporation, is said to be the largest self-contained unit of its type ever built. The complete unit stands 21 1/2 feet high, weighs 124 tons, and required 185,100 pounds of steel for its construction. In order to ship it in an ordinary flat car, the oil-cooled transformer had to be turned on its side and its radiators and bushing removed."
"General acceptance of load center power distribution for 480-volt and 600-volt loads, and the trend toward higher voltages for large motors have increased greatly the importance of high-voltage distribution systems. Paper mills frequently have a large portion of the total load in large motors operating at the high-voltage level, and therefore the fundamental considerations of the high-voltage systems are more complex than in many industrial establishments where all loads are at the 600-volt level."
"Replacing steam tables, low temperature ovens, and hot plates, banks of 250-watt infrared lamps (248 in all) are used to dry the molds and melt out 98 per cent of the wax pattern at the precision “lost-wax” casting foundry of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The balance of the wax is burned in the preheat furnace where molds are heated to 1,000 degrees centigrade for casting. The new process is said to reduce mold cracking."
"Automatic process control and the design of control instruments are developed to such an extent that few continuous processes now are controlled manually. The electric boiler application has lagged behind mainly because instruments must be supplemented with specially arranged equipment as part of the controlling means."
"The installation of electric boilers to provide off-peak loads for hydroelectric utility systems is now widely accepted in Canada. Such installations have proved to be beneficial to utilities, customers, and to the nation in general."
"The load center method of distribution offers many advantages when compared with the old type of distribution by long heavy conductor feeders from a single large substation. Because of the excellent reliability of electric equipment and distribution systems, a straight radial power distribution system is all that usually is warranted."
"A unique source of electric power is Anchorage, Alaska's General Electric 5,400-kw marine turbineelectric power plant, the stern half of the former Government-owned tanker, “SS Sacketts Harbor.” Firmly grounded to the city's shore, at high tide the ship stands in 25 feet of water but at low tide it is high and dry. Power lines, tied into anchorage's distribution system, lead from special rigging on the upper deck."
"HAVING grown up with such quantities as π, ∊, √2, we have become callous to their unreasonableness. Nevertheless, from time to time we are forced to ask ourselves what is wrong with our system of numeration that these quantities should refuse to be expressible either as fractions or as decimal quantities using a finite number of digits. Surely our system permits steps as fine as we please. What change of system would meet the needs, for instance, change from base 10? Or again, we ask, how many of these rebels are there? Is there a mere sprinkling? Is there a generic incommensurable unit — call it I — whereby all incommensurable quantities can be expressed as so many ordinary units plus so many I units, p+qI, a method we are used to for complex quantities?"
"THE ADMINISTRATION of committee activities of the Institute gradually is evolving toward greater unification of groups which have related interests. The board of directors, at its April meeting in Worcester, Mass. (EE, June '47, pp 597–8), set in motion a series of changes intended to revitalize the entire committee structure. Immediately after the meeting, Blake D. Hull, then the presidential nominee, started the formation of the new committee organization in order to enter upon the new year with a full personnel."
"A newly-developed General Electric Company television receiving antenna, known as a “chicken brooder” antenna, will pick up local programs from mobile units without being aimed at the units. Sixteen times more sensitive than a vertical half-wave antenna usually used for this application, it will be employed by television station WMAL in Washington, D. C. The antenna is constructed with three aluminum sections, each of which is conical in shape, ten feet in diameter, and weighs about 100 pounds. A dipole between the first two sections, which are assembled with the apexes of the cones facing each other, forms the actual receiving antenna to which signals are directed by the coneshaped structure."
"Arrangements are in progress for the program of the Midwest general meeting to be held in Chicago, Ill., November 3–7, 1947. Headquarters for the meeting will be in the Congress Hotel. A full program of broad general interest, which is appropriate for the locality of the meeting, will be presented in combination with inspection trips, entertainment, and special activities for the visiting women. The National Electronics Conference at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, November 3–5, and the second International Lighting Exposition at the Stevens Hotel, November 3–7, which is concurrent with the AIEE meeting, assure a busy week in Chicago. A joint session with the National Electronics Conference will be held at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, and all other sessions which have to do with electronic applications and communication will be scheduled on the last two days of the meeting to avoid conflict with the National Electronics Conference sessions."
"Since 1910 the AIEE Pacific District (number 8), the AIEE Northwest District (number 9), and the Vancouver Section of the Canadian District (number 10), have co-operated in the joint project of holding somewhere within their territory each year an AIEE general meeting. With the exception of 1917,1918,1933, and 1945, these meetings have been held annually, alternating among the sponsoring districts. Three times, in 1921, in 1936, and in 1939, the Pacific general meeting was not held separately, but was consolidated with the AIEE summer general meeting which was held on the Pacific Coast."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"Provides a listing of current committee members and society officers."
"More than 80 technical papers will be presented at the National Electronics Conference, which is to be held at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, Chicago, Ill., November 3–5, 1947. Several non-technical addresses are scheduled as well, such as,"
"After several months of effort by interested members of the engineering profession, a Professional Engineers Act was passed during the 1947 session of the California legislature which defines the activities, and permits registration of, electrical, mechanical, chemical, and petroleum engineers."
"News, events, meetings and announcements from other societies that may be of interest to electrical engineers, practitioners and researchers."

"The California Institute of Technology has been indicated as a leader in the field of graduate work in electrical engineering, and thus a consideration of its pattern for such studies should be of profit. Some phases of the institute's program are presented, not because they are considered wholly unique, but because they are of considerable merit and did help to pioneer the way to a high standard of graduate work."
"An electronic stabilizer varies a reactive load electronically to maintain desired voltage and line current in a transmission line. The electronic stabilizer acts upon the transient reactance and therefore it has the fast response needed to increase the stability of long transmission lines."
"Although great progress has been made in obtaining a sound general knowledge of the forces that hold matter together, scientists up to now have not been able to extend this work to three important classes of materials: the complex substances such as proteins that constitute living organisms; atomic nuclei; and metals and alloys; according to Professor Linus Pauling director of the Gates and Crellin laboratories of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology."
"FOR THE PAST several years there has been considerable discussion concerning the 5-year engineering curriculum, and during that time several schools have adopted such a curriculum. The proposal to be presented in this article is a suggested alternative to the 5-year curriculum, and it is believed that it overcomes certain disadvantages of such a curriculum — namely, the stereotyping of the cultural subjects into such a mass-production plan that enthusiasm would be stifled for a majority of the students who might relish the opportunity of studying some cultural subjects."
"Engineering instruction offers many inducements as a professional career according to Doctor R. M. Brick, director of the metallurgical engineering department of the University of Pittsburgh, Pa. In the June issue of Mining and Metallurgy he cites the need for more qualified men with engineering training to go into the teaching profession."
"The second largest consumption of d-c power in the United States for electrochemical use is by the chlorine-caustic industry which is expected to have a capacity of about 494,000 kw before the end of this year. Two major types of electrolytic cells — the diaphragm type and the mercury cathode type — are used to produce chlorine and either potassium or sodium hydroxide. Since 1936 most of the conversion equipment installed for supplying these cells has been mercury-arc rectifiers."
"Of primary importance to the magnesium reduction industry is reliability of power supply. Many of the plants built for the production of the vital material had their own power plants which supplied alternating current to conversion equipment. The major part of the conversion capacity was supplied by mercury-arc rectifiers which provided an excellent service record."
"There are a number of advantages in the operation and maintenance of mercury-arc rectifiers in comparison with rotary converters. Operation of rectifiers has been found to be simple, dependable, and relatively free from trouble by the aluminum industry in the United States. Comments and discussion presented apply only to reduction plants of the Aluminum Company of America."
"A mobile single-phase transformer unit rated 60 cycles, 10,000 kva, 132,000/19,950 volts, has released fixed standby transformer units for other duties, and has added flexibility to the four major transmission substations of the Indianapolis (Ind.) Power and Light Company. This mobile transformer is the product of the General Electric Company."
"The paralleling of mercury-arc rectifiers with rotary converters to increase capacity presents a problem because of the different characteristics of the equipment, but with proper control division of the load can be accomplished successfully."
"The apparatus for the conversion of a-c to d-c power in various plants of the du Pont Company has included rotary converters, motor generator sets, and mercury-arc rectifiers. Operation and maintenance of this equipment since the company's first converters were installed in 1895 to present rectifier installations has provided much valuable experience and information."
"THERE are two distinct types of paper machines to be found in the industry; the Fourdrinier machine, named after its sponsor, and the cylinder machine. These machines with modifications are used in the manufacture of all grades of paper and paperboard."
"Electrical men who have the operation and maintenance of equipment under their supervision realize the importance of an adequate maintenance schedule. Although this article does not outline a definite maintenance schedule for any one mill, it does provide basic information from which any mill electrical supverisor can draw up such a schedule to meet the requirements of local conditions."
"Long considered one of the industrially backward countries of the world, India rapidly is taking steps to remedy this condition, according to the Foreign Commerce Weekly, through a program of government-sponsored research. This program has been operating since 1940 and is interesting to review in the light of the large amount of discussion on government-sponsored research in the United States."
"The diversity of equipment used in any finishing room depends upon the types of paper being produced in the mill, and also on the amount of fancy finishing desired. Some mills such as those producing newsprint normally confine their finishing operations to rewinding and splitting defective rolls; others, such as those in the fine paper field, go in for a multitude of finishing or secondary processes which change the visual or physical characteristics of the original paper. These may be something vastly different, but, nevertheless, very important in their relation to the end use of the paper."
"This 50,000-kva transformer destined for the Snokomish substation of the Bonneville Power Administration near Everett, Wash., is the largest single-phase transformer ever to be built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation."
"A general outline of the electric apparatus to be found in a newsprint mill, from the point-of-view of an electrical engineer in charge of maintenance, indicates what equipment has to be maintained, its choice, and certain requirements for its maintenance. The importance of efficient electrical maintenance is evident from the results that can be obtained provided the proper methods are followed."
"Chipper drive is one of the most exacting applications to which motors are applied. The size of the motor is determined primarily by the high peak loads which occur intermittently when large logs are fed. Motors for this application must be made mechanically stronger than standard to withstand the shock loads and vibration imposed by the chipper."
"A new machine now being built by the United States Navy will subject aircraft pilots and instruments to high accelerations, equivalent to those experienced when flying military aircraft. It will be considerably larger than machines now in use for this purpose."
"RELAYS which combine high speed and great uniformity of performance over long periods of time are required for some uses in the telephone plant. The relays described possess these qualities to an unusual degree. Detailed description is limited to two types, each typical of a generic family in which the principles involved apply to all."
"ELECTRIC contacts between solid metal surfaces tend to give trouble in a number of ways. They wear down, get dirty, stick by locking or welding, and chatter. It long has been recognized that all of these difficulties might be avoided by using mercury contact surfaces instead of solid metal. However, most designs of relays and switches employing mercury have tended to be slow in operation, ordinarily being based on the motion of a fairly large quantity of mercury by gravitational acceleration."
"Precise aiming of floodlights is one of the secrets of successful sports field floodlighting. Each of the hundreds of lights must be directed at a slightly different spot to illuminate the play properly and at the same time to keep glare from the spectators' and players' eyes. Here the packing boxes in which the lights originally were shipped from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation are arranged on the Polo Grounds of the New York Giants according to a predetermined plan to act as targets. A rifle sight built into each light makes it possible to aim the lights in daylight."
"PCM, pulse count modulation, is a recent development in the field of pulse time multiplexing. Computations and experimental work indicate that accepted standards of telephone transmission over wire and radio commercial systems can be obtained with a relatively small number of quantization levels."
"PCM, pulse code modulation, is a new solution to the problem of overcrowded frequency spectrum. It appears to have exceptional possibilities from the standpoint of freedom from interference, and seems to have inherent advantages over other types of multiplexing."
"TECHNICAL PAPERS previewed in this section will be presented at the AIEE Midwest general meeting, Chicago, Ill., November 3–7, 1947, and will be distributed in advance pamphlet form as soon as they become available. Members may obtain copies by mail from the AIEE Order Department, 33 West 39th Street, New York 1ft, N. Y., at prices indicated with the abstracts; or at five cents less per copy if purchased at AIEE headquarters or at the meeting registration desk. Prices of copies to nonmembers will be twice those for members, less five cents for mailed copies."
"Departing from the traditional practice of holding such meetings in New York City, as an innovation the AIEE 1948 winter general meeting will be held in Pittsburgh, Pa., January 26–30, in the center of the coal mining and steel industry. A broad program, covering practically the entire range of Institute technical activities, will be presented by the four main groups: industry, power, communication and science, and general applications. By virtue of location the industry group has chosen as a theme “mining and steel,” with 13 sessions in prospect which center about this subject. Meeting headquarters will be in Hotel William Penn, which has excellent facilities to hold comfortably six parallel sessions per day."
"The Middle Eastern District meeting held in Dayton, Ohio, September 23–25, 1947, with headquarters at the Dayton-Biltmore Hotel, is the first such meeting that the District has held since October 1940 when the District met in Cincinnati. A meeting originally planned for October 1942 in Pittsburgh, Pa., was canceled because of war conditions. The District meeting program in the Middle Eastern District was instituted in 1925 when a meeting was held in Washington, D. C. Subsequently, the Cleveland, Bethlehem, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Akron, and Scranton Sections each have sponsored one District meeting, and Baltimore and Cincinnati have sponsored two each. The 1949 Middle Eastern District meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington, D. C, under the sponsorship of the Washington Section in October 1949."
"The Middle Eastern District executive committee, under the chairmanship of AIEE Vice-President G. W. Bauer, held an all-day meeting at the Biltmore Hotel in Dayton, Ohio, Monday, September 22, 1947, preceding the Middle Eastern District meeting which began there the following day. Some 43 Section chairmen, vicechairmen, secretaries, or delegates were present representing the District's 15 Sections. Also present were District Secretary A. C. Muir, District Vice-Chairman F. H. Knapp of the AIEE membership committee, Chairman P. L. Hoover of the District committee on Student activities, Chairman L. J. Fritz of the Middle Eastern general committee, W. A. Dynes (of Dayton) of the AIEE Section committee, and AIEE Secretary H. H. Henline."

"The first of a series of articles prepared by the newly formed AIEE nucleonics committee, this discussion gives a general introduction to the rapidly developing field of atomic research. The series will be a primer in nuclear theory for engineers, and will include such timely subjects as nuclear engineering, production of high energy particles, isotope separation, nuclear piles, and health hazards."
"Establishment of great coal liquification and gassing plants with vast new industries by the year 2,000 was predicted by AIEE Past President C. A. Powell (F '41) assistant to the vice-president of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, in a recent speech on “Sources of Power” before the Rocky Mountain League."
"Landings with visibility less than 660 feet are possible and practicable with welldesigned and co-ordinated electronic, lighting, and thermal aids, Commercial air lines well may profit from the tests described."
"Increasing attention is being given to the subject of power transmission at higher and higher voltages because of the economies that can be effected by so doing. The Tidd test project has been organized to obtain much needed information that will help make such transmission practical."
"Still another idea is added to the growing list of suggestions for improving the engineering curriculum. The authors, both teachers of English, suggest setting up a special graduate training program for potential teachers of English in engineering schools. Such a program would produce the ideal instructor — a teacher who is trained both in engineering and in English."
"THE Colorado River is a muddy stream that constitutes the lifeblood of the Pacific Southwest, the most important feature of which is the ultimate scarcity of its water or its ultimate inability to supply the potential needs of the communities dependent on it for irrigation and domestic water supply. The next feature of importance is the potential power capability of the river and its relation to the power needs of this same Pacific Southwest area."
"The limitations of present overcurrent tripping devices for low-voltage systems have hastened the development of a single unit which can be adjusted to any desired characteristics and meets all the requirements for delayed tripping devices."
"A governing system is proposed which is believed capable of accomplishing optimum and inherent load division among generating stations without dependence upon load telemetering systems. The primary objective of this article is the invitation of discussion which can guide further development of such a system."
"A 5-member commission of which the author was a member was sponsored by the Secretary of War to prepare a study on the Japanese electric power system. After 4 1/2 months in Japan, the commission made recommendations to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur with respect to reparations. This article stems from the author's experiences in examining the Japanese utility systems."
"AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY of very large highs-peed propeller-driven aircraft could be increased substantially if the power plants could be moved out of the wings, thereby decreasing the size of the nacelles. In addition, a plan then might be worked out whereby each power plant could operate at its lowest specific fuel consumption point, with some units being shut down during low load periods. However, such a scheme is not feasible under current practice because of difficulties which would be encountered in transmitting mechanical power through flexible members. Stopping engines and feathering the propellers directly connected to them is a rather unsatisfactory method of reducing power, and can be quite dangerous in wartime."
"The tube laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards is carrying on a basic and applied research program on vacuum tubes in collaboration with industry, for military and industrial uses."
"This brief history of studies in solar radiation well may serve to re-emphasize the significance of both ancient and recent discoveries. The romance of these studies, however, should not overshadow the long hours of labor contributed to each investigation."
"The importance of studying the properties of surfaces and other geometrical bodies of higher dimension as a whole instead of studying their properties in a small region was stressed by C. B. Allendoerfer, Haverford College, in a paper, “Global Theorems in Riemannian Geometry,” presented before the American Mathematical Society."
"An apparatus which is sufficiently flexible to be readily adaptable for use with rotating machinery of various sizes and designs is claimed to permit safe and rapid removal of heavy rotor assemblies. Cribbing, rollers, large capacity hoists are replaced by equipment which is safe to operate, and which allows for a minimum chance of accident."
"A new instrument for accurately measuring, recording, and controlling the rate of flow, as well as the total flow, of fluids applies an electrocaloric principle. A wattmeter is used to indicate and record the rate of flow and a watt-hour meter to register the total flow. The scale of the meter is linear and covers a very wide range."
"To give AIEE members an indication of the scope and nature of the 78 scheduled technical papers presented at the third National Electronics Conference held November 3–7, 1947, in Chicago, Ill., the following digests are offered. These are based mainly on information supplied by the authors."
"Historically, Pittsburgh means much to the electrical industry as a whole and to the Institute in particular. The a-c system of power distribution, which is used universally today, found its taproots here, and one of the first and largest of the Institute Sections likewise originated in Pittsburgh. The city contributed many outstanding men who became prominent in the management of Institute affairs."
"With a verified registration of 1449, the first in the fourth and newest series of AIEE national meetings was held at the Congress Hotel in Chicago, Ill., November 3–7, 1947. The high attendance and the extent of active individual participation in this meeting would seem to constitute a vindication of the judgment of those whose foresight and planning led to the establishment of this new series of meetings, known officially as AIEE Midwest general meetings, which is expected to be held annually somewhere in that vast area generally known as the “Middle West,” the better to serve AIEE members in that area. The Milwaukee Section has asked for and received the sponsorship for the meeting in the fall of 1948, and there is conversation about Cincinnati, Ohio, for the fall of 1949."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"After several years study, which included a broad cross section of views and discussion at the conference of vice-presidents and District secretaries, held during the summer general meeting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, June 9–13, 1947, a special committee on award of Institute prizes recommended changes in the prizes for technical papers, which were approved by the board of directors, August 11, 1947, to become effective January 1, 1948."
"A conference on special electron tubes for use in electronic instruments is being sponsored by the AIEE subcommittee on electronic instruments, which is a joint subcommittee under the electronics committee and the committee on instruments and measurements. This committee, feeling that there was a need in the instrument field for tubes having special characteristics, principally longer life and closer tolerances on the important electrical characteristics, has conducted a survey of the instrument manufacturers, industrial laboratories, and others interested in a special tube program. The survey has shown that a considerable demand for such tubes exists and indicated the characteristics and tolerances which were thought desirable."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"More than 2,400 people attended the third National Electronics Conference which was held in Chicago, Ill., November 3–5, 1947. About 1,900 of this number were paid registrations, and the balance was made up to students and exhibitors."

"Radar proved to be one of the most important technical achievements of World War II. It has many sources, some as far back as the nineteenth century, yet its rapid wartime growth was the result of military necessity. This development will continue, for radar has increasing applications in a peacetime world."
"This paper deals mainly with various ‘distribution functions’ and ‘cumulative distribution functions’ pertaining to the modulus and to the angle of the ‘normal’ complex variate, for the case where the mean value of this variate is zero. Also, for auxiliary uses chiefly, the distribution function pertaining to the reciprocal of the modulus is included. For all of these various probability functions the paper derives convenient general formulas, and for four of the functions it supplies comprehensive sets of curves; furthur, it gives a table of computed values of the cumulative distribution function for the modulus, serving to verify the values computed by a different method in an earlier paper by the same author.1"
"The problem here is to find the frequency spectrum produced by the simultaneous application of a number of frequencies to various forms of amplitude limiters or switches. The method of solution presented here is to first resolve the output wave into a series of rectangular waves or pulses and then to combine the spectrum of the individual pulses by vectorial means to find the spectrum of the output. The rectangular wave shape was chosen here as the basic unit in order to make the method easy to apply to pulse modulators."
"Commercial Broadcasting Pioneer. The WEAF Experiment: 1922–1926.1 WILLIAM PECK BANNING. WEAF, the radio call letters which for nearly a quarter of a century designated a broadcasting station famous for its pioneering achievements, ceased last November to have its old significance. WNBC are the new call letters. This book is an excellent record of the four years during which this station was the experimental radio broadcasting medium of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company."
"The spectacutar development of radar during World War II remains an outstanding achievement in the history of communications and the allied electronic sciences. With military necessity furnishing the required driving force and through the full interchange of technical knowledge among all interested workers in this field, it has been possible to extend our visual senses far beyond the horizons considered quite inelastic only a few years ago. The potentialities of radar in the peacetime world and the future application of radar design principles and techniques to the communications and allied fields justify a review of some further details of this wartime development."
"In Practically all pulsed oscillators such as those used in radar, some means must be provided to apply the pulse voltage to the oscillator circuit. In many early radars, a high-vacuum modulator was used for this purpose. The pulse was generated at low power level and then amplified by means of one or more stages employing high vacuum tubes. The final stage was required to block, or cut off the d-c supply voltage with no pulse applied, and to permit as much as possible of the d-c voltage to appear on the oscillator during the pulse. Since most radar oscillators operate at pulse voltages of from 5 to 20 kv and require currents of several amperes during the pulse, the requirements of the modulator tubes are quite severe. Standard transmitting1 tubes were used at first, the higher power tubes having the necessary voltage rating and having in general a fair amount of cathode emission. Tubes were operated in parallel to provide the required amount of current. Practically all of these tubes were of the thoriated tungsten filament type. For example an early army radar, the SCR268,2 employed 8 tubes in parallel having a total filament power of 1040 watts to provide a pulse current of about 10 amperes. The use of such equipment in portable or airborne service would be obviously impractical because of the large power consumption, bulk, and weight. In an attempt to provide tubes more suited to this type of service, those described in this paper were developed."
"The polyrod, a new form of microwave endfire antenna, is described. This consists of a properly shaped dielectric rod protruding from a metal waveguide. For applications requiring moderate gain, it possesses desirable electrical and mechanical properties. It is useful as a unit antenna in broadside arrays on account of its low crosstalk into adjacent polyrods. This paper describes work done from 1941 to 1944 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Holmdel, N. J. Important individual contributions are acknowledged in some of the footnotes. A report of this development has been withheld from earlier publication for reasons of military security."
"The effective echoing areas of certain radar targets can be calculated by the methods of geometrical optics. Other more complicated structures have been investigated experimentally. This paper considers a number of targets of practical interest with particular emphasis on trihedral and biconical comer reflectors. The possibility is indicated of using especially designed targets of high efficiency as aids to radar navigation."
"This paper presents tables of the phase associated with a semi-infinite unit slope of attenuation. The phase is given in degrees to .001 degree with an accuracy of ± .001 degree and in radians to .00001 radian with an accuracy of ± .000015 radian. The method of constructing the tables and a brief analysis of the errors are given. An appendix, which gives a detailed explanation with specific examples of the use of the tables in determining the phase associated with a given attenuation characteristic or the reactance associated with a given resistance characteristic by means of the straight line approximation method given in Bode's “Network Analysis and Feedback Amplifier Design,” is included for the benefit of those who are not already acquainted with this method. The Appendix also presents an example of a non-minimum phase network1 in which the minimum phase determined from the attenuation characteristic fails to predict the true phase of the network."
"An experiment in transmitting speech by Pulse Code Modulation, or PCM, is described in this paper. Each sample amplitude of a pulse amplitude modulation or PAM signal is transmitted by a code group of ON-OFF pulses. 2n amplitude values can be represented by an n-digit binary number code. For a nominal 4 kc. speech band these n ON-OFF pulses are transmitted 8000 times a second. Experimental equipment for coding the PAM pulses at the transmitter and decoding the PCM pulses at the receiver is described. Experiments with this equipment indicate that a three-unit code appears to be necessary for a minimum grade of circuit, while a six- or seven-unit code will provide good quality."
"Certain hitherto unpublished theoretical results on cylindrical cavity resonators are derived. These are: an approximation formula for the total number of resonances in a circular cylinder; conditions to yield the minimum volume circular cylinder for an assigned Q; limitation of the frequency range of a tunable circular cylinder as set by ambiguity; resonant frequencies of the elliptic cylinder; resonant frequencies and Q of a coaxial resonator in its higher modes; and a brief discussion of fins in a circular cylinder. The essential results are condensed in a number of new tables and graphs."
"A method is described for determining accurately the magnitude of the reflection coefficient caused by an impedance mismatch in waveguide by measuring the ratio between incident and reflected voltages. Reflection coefficients of any value less than 0.05 (0.86 db standing wave ratio) can be measured to an accuracy of ± 2.5%."
"The reflex oscillator is a form of long-transit-time tube which has distinct advantages as a low power source at high frequencies. It may be light in weight, need have no magnetic focusing field, and can be made to operate at comparatively low voltages. A single closed resonator is used, so that tuning is very simple. Because the whole resonator is at the same dc voltage high frequency by-pass difficulties are obviated."
"Investigation of Oxidation of Copper by Use of Radioactive Cu Tracer.1 J. BARDEEN, W. H. BRATTAIN, and W. SHOCKLEY. A very thin layer of radioactive copper was electrolytically deposited on a copper blank. The surface was then oxidized in air at 1000°C for 18 minutes, giving an oxide layer with a thickness of 1.25 × 10−2 cm. After quenching, successive layers of the oxide were removed chemically, and the copper activity in each layer was measured. The observed self-diffusion of radioactive copper in the oxide agrees quantitatively with a theory based on the following assumptions: (a) The oxide grows by diffusion of vacant Cu+ sites from the outer surface of the oxide inward to the metal. (b) The concentration of vacant sites as the oxygen-oxide interface is independent of the oxide thickness, and drops linearly from this constant value to zero at the metal boundary. (c) Accompanying the inward flow of vacant sites, there is a flow of positive electron holes such as to maintain electrical neutrality. (d) Self-diffusion of copper ions takes place only by motion into vacant sites. The results give a fairly direct confirmation of the theory of oxidation first suggested by Wagner."
"To Those not familiar with the design of microwave radars the extensive war use of recently developed crystal rectifiers1 in radar receiver frequency converters may be surprising. In the renaissance of this once familiar component of early radio receiving sets there have been developments in materials, processes, and structural design leading to vastly improved converters through greater sensitivity, stability, and ruggedness of the rectifier unit. As a result of these developments a series of crystal rectifiers was engineered for production in large quantities to the exacting electrical specifications demanded by advanced microwave techniques and to the mechanical requirements demanded of combat equipment."
"Formulas are given for the calculation of the current streamlines and intensity in the walls of a circular cylindrical cavity resonator. Tables are given which permit the calculation to be carried out for many of the lower order modes."
"Aeolotropic substances have been used for a wide variety of elastic piezoelectric, dielectric, pyroelectric, temperature expansive, piezo-optic and electro-optic effects. While most of these effects may be found treated in various publications1 there does not appear to be any integrated treatment of them by the tensor method which greatly simplifies the method of writing and manipulating the relations between fundamental quantities, Other short hand methods such as the matrix method2 can also be used for all the linear effects, but for second order effects involving tensors higher than rank four, tensor methods are essential. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this paper to present such a derivation. The notation used is that agreed upon by a committee of piezoelectric experts under the auspices of the Institute of Radio Engineers."
"Methods of solution and specific results are given for the spectrum of the response of devices which have sharply defined transitions between conducting and non-conducting regions in their characteristics. The input wave consists of one or more sinusoidal components and the operating point is adjusted by bias, which may either be independently applied or produced by the rectified output itself."
"A new circuit element and control device, the thermistor or thermally sensitive resistor, is made of solid semiconducting materials whose resistance decreases about four per cent per centigrade degree. The thermistor presents interesting opportunities to the designer and engineer in many fields of technology for accomplishing tasks more simply, economically and better than with available devices. Part I discusses the conduction mechanism in semiconductors and the criteria for usefulness of circuit elements made from them. The fundamental physical properties of thermistors, their construction, their static and dynamic characteristics and general principles of operation are treated. Part II of this paper deals with the applications of thermistors. These include: sensitive thermometers and temperature control elements, simple temperature compensators, ultrahigh frequency power meters, automatic gain controls for transmission systems such as the Types K2 and L1 carrier telephone systems, voltage regulators, speech volume limiters, compressors and expandors, gas pressure gauges and flowmeters, meters for thermal conductivity determination of liquids, and contactless time delay devices. Thermistors with short time constants have been used as sensitive bolometers and show promise as simple compact audio-frequency oscillators, modulators and amplifiers."
"Capacitors — Their Use in Electronic Circuits.1 M. BROTHERTON. This book tells how to choose and use capacitors for electronic circuits. It explains the basic factors which control the characteristics of capacitors and determine their proper operation. It helps to provide that broad understanding of the capacitor problem which is indispensable to the efficient design of circuits. It tells the circuit designer what he must understand and consider in transforming capacitance from a circuit symbol into a practical item of apparatus capable of meeting the growing severity of today's operation requirements."
"During the past few years there has been a rapidly growing need for a more accurate expression of the photographic speed of a lens than is afforded by the simple f-number ratio."
"At present the diaphragm markings of a photographic lens are based entirely upon geometrical considerations and do not take into account the losses of light resulting from absorption, reflection, and scattering. A method of equivalent marking is described in which, for example, the marking 8 does not correspond to the geometrically determined aperture ratio 1:8 but to an opening sufficiently larger to permit the transmission of as much light as would be transmitted by the aperture 1:8 in the absence of any losses due to absorption, reflection, and vignetting. Such a system of apertures may be referred to as equivalent or compensated apertures. — Two systems of compensation are given, one based upon the illumination at the center of the field and the other based upon the average illumination over the entire field thus taking vignetting into account. A relatively simple photometric procedure for determining either of the two systems of compensated graduation is described. For use during a transition period a system of markings is described which will permit exposures to be determined either with light losses compensated or by the present method without compensation. Except for the change of markings on a lens no other instrumental changes are required to apply the new system of exposure determination."
"An instrument for calibrating iris scales of photographic lenses is described. The iris scales are calibrated in T stops based on the photometric transmission parallel to the axis. This follows the procedure proposed by Daily.1 The new instrument employs measuring and comparison of optical paths which receive alternate light pulses from a single incandescent source. Calibrated attenuation is provided in the comparison beam so that the two systems may be balanced to give a null output from the photomultiplier cell which is used as a null detector. The null-balance principle makes the unit extremely stable and the sensitivity is sufficient to make accurate measurements on iris openings as small as 0.031 in., which corresponds to 1 in. T 32. Data are given on transmission of several lens types, and on the accuracy of the instrument, and a proposal is made for changing over to the new system."
"Many methods have been proposed to replace the geometrical f ratio by an effective calibration which takes the transmittance of the lens into consideration, but no method proposed so far has been accepted. The author outlines a new method of photoelectric lens calibration using the null method which compares the lens to be calibrated to a standard lens. This standard can be easily reproduced with a very high uniformity of performance. The method has been tested very thoroughly and is now in practical use for lens calibration. The accuracy obtained with this method is far superior to any procedure used so far. Its simplicity enables even an unskilled operator to obtain accurate results combined with a high working speed."
"A servo-type of mechanism has been devised which automatically will maintain a lens in focus under the guidance of any one of a number of distance-measuring devices, or which may be arranged to replace the Selsyn-type of remote control for focusing a lens. The mechanism requires no special cam or nonlinear element to fit a particular lens, but automatically solves the equation of any lens for which it may be adjusted at the moment. When replacing a Selsyn system this servomechanism has the advantage that it can never get out of step. The system is particularly applicable to motion picture camera lenses in follow-focus work."
"The mass market necessarily is a price market, since only in the low-price brackets are sufficient purchasers found to warrant large volume production. — Low cost can be achieved while high relative value is maintained, only if the engineering adheres carefully to these fundamentals: (a) elimination of unnecessary features; (b) determination of acceptable minimum levels of performance; (c) provision for attractive external appearance; (d) design of parts for mass production by proper selection of dimensional tolerances, careful tooling to insure such tolerances, and the use of suitable materials; (e) the establishment of economical assembly-line procedure by considering assembly problems from the inception of parts design, providing accurate assembly fixtures, and maintaining adequate process inspection throughout manufacture."
"Distortion caused by speed variation in recording or reproducing has long been a serious source of quality degradation in sound recording. “Flutter” is the term most generally used for this type of distortion by the motion picture industry, while the broadcast recording field knows it as “wow”."
"Industry-wide agreement on a standard method of measuring flutter in 35-mm motion picture sound film reproducers is now being sought by the motion picture industry through the Society of Motion Picture Engineers and the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The ultimate success of the project depends primarily upon industry acceptance of the basic standards."
"After rechecking the work of the Subcommittee on Film of the Television Committee, it was found that broadcast stations needed a test reel which would allow dynamic checks of their systems. A reel was manufactured and its possible uses are described."
"The possibilities of theater television are discussed strictly from the box-office viewpoint. There is also a compilation of the many events which would make good box-office fare, and a description of many new uses to which theater television may be put which would attract people to the theater. How theater television may supplant the present motion picture programs and a positive viewpoint on theater television as a legitimate and necessary adjunct to the motion picture theater are also considered."
"The operation of a conventional Geneva-type intermittent mechanism is analyzed and used as a basis for developing several thoughts which may lead to a reduction of pull-down time. Reduction of pull-down time is desirable in that it permits the use of shutter blades of smaller width, thus either increasing the screen brightness or permitting the same screen brightness with less power in the lamp. The increase in the acceleration of the film due to the reduction in the pull-down time naturally will increase the wear and damage to the film. Means are shown, however, whereby the pull-down time may be reduced without subjecting the film to any greater acceleration than occurs with the conventional Geneva-type intermittent mechanism and consequently will not increase the wear on the film."
"Recorders have been designed to provide the motion picture industry with improved lightweight recording machines capable of recording any of the standard types of negative or direct positive sound tracks. Separate recorders have been designed for use with 35- and 16-mm film, each recorder being designed for optimum performance with the film for which it was designed. Chief features of the recorders are improved performance, dependable operation, compactness, minimum weight, and accessibility for servicing, combined with attractive styling. The recorders have been designed so that the film may be driven from left to right or from right to left through the head assembly with equal stability. An automatic film take-up mechanism of the self-reversing type is provided."
"It has been necessary in the past to control the color balance and exposure of 16-mm duplicating printers by making actual test prints at frequent intervals. A large amount of footage could be risked during the time required for processing the test prints. A method is described by which it is possible to check the balance of the printer instantly by means of tricolor readings with a photronic cell."
"This paper describes three types of loudspeaker systems which have been designed for 16-mm sound on film reproduction. One system uses a dia-cone speaker mounted in a portable leatherette carrying case. A 12-inch speaker is used and the acoustic radiation is obtained from two diaphragms attached to a single voice coil. The outer diaphragm is of the molded-cone type and the inner is a domed dural type of diaphragm which is attached at its edges to the 3-inch voice coil. A second system is mounted in a portable cabinet which has 3.2 cubic feet and is resonated for maximum response down to 85 cycles. The speaker is of the 15-inch type and of similar construction to the 12-inch with the addition of a 6-cell multicellular horn mounted directly in front of the 3-inch dural diaphragm. The third system consists of a duplex speaker and is intended for permanent and semipermanent installations."
"Source, size, lens aperture, steadiness, film resolution, and similar factors govern the present-day and anticipated future limits of 8-mm motion pictures as to dynamic resolution, illumination, and possible sound on film. — In order to evaluate the subject to screen performance of motion picture systems, a test method was employed which indicated the total resolution of the camera, film, and projector. In order to record resolutions equivalent to those seen by eye, it was found necessary to add the images of several frames because of persistence of vision. The same conditions appear to apply to television."
"This paper outlines the design objectives involved in the production of a precision-made 8-mm projector, consideration being given to sales attractiveness in styling, distinctiveness, and simplicity of appearance; problems in film handling, simplification of functions, minimizing operational controls, illumination efficiency as correlated with film movement and optics; temperature control; and production cost economy in parts and assemblies."
"The first commercial 8-mm sound projector has been introduced with the sound on a disk running at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute. An automatic-synchronization method is used, and the turntable and the projector are not mechanically connected. Eight-millimeter sound films for use with the machine are available."
"This paper describes a new combination sunshade and filter holder which is designed for use on almost any 16- or 8-mm camera. The device is so designed that it not only acts as an adequate light- and sunshade for the camera lens, but by employing a series of slides it will accept gelatin or cemented filters, diffusion disks, gauzes, and pola-screens in various sizes."
"The operation of a spring-driven motion picture camera is seriously affected if a mechanical tachometer is used to measure the speed. Equipment has been developed and made to give a direct reading of camera speed utilizing a light beam as the connecting link."
"This paper discusses the construction of the new Republic Productions scoring stage and includes a description of the electrical equipment used for the recording of music. In the building of the stage, which is probably the largest scoring studio in the world, aesthetic elements were given equal consideration with acoustic factors. — It was also deemed important that the enclosure contain all of the necessary facilities for music recording, such as a dual-reverberation chamber with a remotely controlled door, a vocal room with a large window between it and the stage, two monitoring rooms with concealed speakers, a conductor's podium, and an efficient air-conditioning system."
"A brief summary of the development of the low-reflection coating is given. As instruments were improved, a point was soon reached where further improvement in optical design required elimination of surface reflections. An explanation of the color effect observed in a coating and a method of applying a film whose index varies from top to bottom which will eliminate the color effect is described. A comparison is drawn between the coating produced by natural aging, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, magnesium fluoride, and the American Optical Company low-reflection coatings. This shows that the magnesium fluoride is the most practical film to date when all factors are taken into consideration. The American Optical method of applying coatings without using vacuum is described. There are four main advantages in using a low-reflection coating: (1) elimination of reflections, (2) increased transmission, (3) increased contrast, and (4) increased chemical stability. Several tests are outlined which indicate that glass properly coated with magnesium fluoride will withstand more chemical abuse than uncoated glass. A new method of removing a high-temperature-baked low-reflection coating using melted crystals of potassium bisulfate is described which will materially speed the decoating process."
"During the evolution of cinematography there has been a constant demand for increased light from a single source. Early attempts to meet this demand were made by improvements in lamp projection optics and by increasing both size and power input of the light source.1 In recent years a great deal of work has been done toward increasing the intrinsic brilliancy of the high-intensity carbon-arc source, This has resulted in a series of carbons known as super-high-intensity carbons.2, 3 This paper will describe the requirements of the motion picture industry which brought about the production of these super-high-intensity carbons and will cover details of the development and design of carbon-arc lamps to burn them. The use of super-high-intensity carbon-arc units in motion picture studios may properly be divided into (a) Process background projection;4 (b) Set lighting.1"
"A new light modulator, recently developed, has very low distortion and greatly improved performance characteristics. It is of the magnetic type and is mechanically and optically interchangeable with the present RCA sound-recording galvanometers. The power required for 100 per cent modulation is 1.25 w. Distortion characteristics, frequency-response curves, and impedance data are shown. The effect of bias current upon the performance characteristics is also given."
"The “Zoomar” lens is a varifocal objective for motion picture cameras which achieves the change of focus by the linear movement of a single barrel. The new feature of this lens consists of the principle of changing the focal length of the system by one group of lens components without consideration of the displacement of the image plane, while a second lens component, rigidly coupled to the first by the common barrel, compensates for this displacement."
"The equipment described was developed for analyzing underwater motion of solid bodies. The experiments demanded a high rate of picture taking and that the subject studied should be in the field of at least two cameras at all times. Edgerton-type flash lamps instead of shutter mechanisms were adapted, an endless film belt giving a one-second exposure was developed, and a film speed of approximately 35 ft per sec used."
"This paper deals with future AAF requirements for motion picture equipment to meet such extremes as exposures at altitudes of 100,000 ft and speeds of 1500 mph. It discusses three wartime cameras which are focused on things to come."
"Wartime requirements of airborne armament led to the development of a successful system of stabilization which, when applied to gun turrets, enabled gunners to track a target with greater ease. At present, the system is being adapted to the stabilization of aerial cameras to overcome certain faults inherent in present photographic techniques. This paper discusses the problems and describes the system applied to aerial photography."
"The Society of Motion Picture Engineers on Oct. 27, 1944, and on Mar. 2, 1945, through its representative, Paul J. Larsen, submitted recommendations for allocations of frequencies for a national theater television service. The Federal Communications Commission on May 25, 1945, granted such allocations of frequencies for a national theater television service on an experimental, “parity of opportunity” basis with television broadcasting."
"A new series of highly corrected anastigmatic lenses with an aperture ratio of f/2.3 is offered for 16-mm motion picture cameras. Surfaces are given antireflection coatings. A new type of mount guarantees centration."
"With the death of Dr. Wilbur B. Rayton on Oct. 31, 1946, while on a business trip to Los Angeles and San Francisco, the nation lost one of its top-ranking optical engineers. While in California he attended the Hollywood Convention of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers and presented a paper on 16-mm lenses, published in this issue."
"This paper outlines the tools and means that are at the disposal of the motion picture production mixer to enable him to fulfill his prime responsibility of being the director's assistant in all matters pertaining to sound. A parallel is drawn between the work of the soundman and the cameraman. Particular emphasis is placed on the artistic capabilities and qualifications required by the mixer to ensure the degree of confidence and co-operation that must exist among the soundman, the director, and the cast in order that sound may contribute its full share to the realistic quality of the final product."
"All present 16-mm film splices standardized by the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, while possessing the necessary strength, have the undesirable characteristic of being visible on the screen. A new splice has been developed which does not encroach on the picture aperture area, and nevertheless retains sufficient strength for printing and projection operations. The principle, equipment, and abuse tests are described."
"Although film splicers of conventional design produce serviceable splices when in the hands of experienced operators, they leave much to be desired in the way of operational ease. The splicer described in this paper is simple to use and because all operations are mechanized, including scraping the emulsion, good splices are assured. The 16- and 35-mm professional models are hot-splicers, having heating elements as integral parts of the stationary shear blade."
"Some twenty years ago, at a meeting of the SMPE, T. E. Finegan, who was then associated with the Eastman Kodak Company, presented a paper to you on “The Development of Classroom Films”. This was before the introduction of the “talking picture” to the classroom, and in fact, it was in the very early days of classroom films of any kind whatever. And yet, even as far back as twenty years ago, Mr. Finegan was able to present a number of salient principles which are as valid today as they ever were. Some of these principles have not only been validated but strengthened and sharpened up by the experience of the past twenty years, as I hope to show you during the course of this discussion."
"A type of fully compensated constant resistance network is described which provides a larger family of equalization characteristics particularly suited to corrective use in rerecording as determined by aural monitoring."
"It is generally conceded that the present 5/16-in. diameter shaft and 1/8-in. drive key on present film reel handling equipment such as magazines, rewinds, etc., are inadequate to support and drive 2000-ft reels of 35-mm film. Much unnecessary film damage is caused by the reel wobble, backlash, and poor alignment caused by this situation. This paper describes an improved reel design featuring a 1-in. diameter splined hub shaft opening and an automatic ball and groove locking device to provide accurate lateral alignment and eliminate manually operated keys on reel shafts. — To reduce film shipping damage, a design is suggested for an exchange reel shipping case with a center shaft passing through the 1-in. openings in the hubs of the new reels."
"New magnetic recording media have been developed during recent years which will widen substantially the field of application for magnetic recording equipment. Probably most outstanding among the new recording media is the non-ferrous wire or tape, plated with a thin layer of nickel-cobalt alloy, and the paper disks and tapes coated with a dispersion of magnetic powder. — It might be of particular interest to the motion picture industry that the coated recording media can be perforated to obtain synchronization between picture and sound. It is also possible to apply the magnetic coating directly to the film base."
"A magnetic sound track on motion picture film is convenient and economical. The final recording can be monitored while it is being made and requires no processing. All or part of the sound track can be erased, and a new record put on; or the film can be edited in the usual manner. Apparatus for making high-quality records is described, including the sound head, constant speed drive mechanism, amplifier equipment, and the magnetic track. Over-all performance, frequency response, dynamic range, and distortion are given."
"Recent developments in magnetic recording have led to practical use of this art as a high-fidelity recording system. The particular apparatus described is the result of a need for wire recording equipment of professional caliber. It is characterized by good frequency response, low distortion, freedom from “wow” and flutter, and lock-in synchronous drive. The electrical and electromagnetic portions are the result of experience gained by research during the war. The mechanical portions have many parallels in motion picture equipment design. This apparatus is suitable for many motion picture recording applications."
"The object of this paper is to discuss the application of coated paper tape as a magnetic sound recording medium. The special features of this interesting new development which may render it desirable for many commercial uses are pointed out. Current trends in recorder design are discussed. A brief summary of tape recorder performance is given, including dynamic range, frequency response, and distortion characteristics. Some special features of the new recording medium relative to its possible use in the motion picture industry are pointed out."
"The following notes on discussions held at two meetings of the Research Council Basic Sound Committee concern the use of magnetic recording in motion picture studios. These meetings were held for a general discussion between the designers and manufacturers of magnetic recording and reproducing equipment and studio sound personnel for two reasons: (1) to allow the manufacturer to have an idea of the possible uses of their equipment and to obtain very general specifications on equipment to fulfill these uses, and (2) to allow studio personnel to obtain an idea of the present and possible future capabilities of magnetic systems. — It should be realized that definite conclusions have not yet been reached and the recommendations contained herein are very tentative. — The Research Council Basic Sound Committee has set up a Subcommittee on Magnetic Recording. This subcommittee is available to answer questions concerning studio practices and recording and reproducing equipment and will co-operate actively with those interested in the design, development, and manufacture of magnetic recording and reproducing equipment. Inquiries to this subcommittee may be addressed to the Research Council, 1217 Taft Building, Hollywood 28, Calif."
"Magnetic sound recording systems are being investigated for possible application by the motion picture industry. With limited current literature and the general nature of present industry discussions, certain peculiar requirements for studio use have not been taken into account, but are outlined here. The discussion represents the opinion of one studio's sound department based on the present state of developments and the information at hand, but is, of course, subject to modification as experience and additional information are acquired."
"This year of 1946, on July 24, marked 30 years of achievement in motion picture engineering for the Society of Motion Picture Engineers. The general growth, progress and achievement of our Society has been described in a previous article by Hyndman and Maurer.1 I thought you might be interested in a brief review of the accomplishments of your Society this year."
"The Journal Award for 1946 has been made to Ralph H. Talbot for his paper entitled “The Projection Life of Film,” which was published in the August 1945 issue of the Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers. This paper described several types of film damage and means by which each of the types can be minimized, or in some cases almost eliminated. An illuminated certificate was presented to Mr. Talbot in Hollywood, California, at the banquet held at the Hollywood-Roosevelt Hotel on the evening of October 23, 19 46, during the 60th Semiannual Convention of the Society. The Journal Award is presented each year to the author or authors of the most outstanding paper originally published in the Journal during the preceding calendar year and treating some phase of motion picture engineering."
"The purpose, organization, and operation of the Committee on Motion Pictures are described, with particular reference to its relation to other standards groups such as the SMPE Standards Committee and the Standards Committee of the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
"Years ago, when I was at college, I had to listen to many lectures I did not think I wanted to hear. Most of them turned out to be valuable lectures; some were interesting; a few were even entertaining. I cannot forget, however, my profound distaste for the speaker who began with a recitation of historical data, hastily collected from the opening pages of the college catalogue, which his listeners had read, studied, and lived with for months. Such a recitation usually gave notice of a talk which spanned more time than its subject matter deserved."
"Data are reported on the amount of light that can be projected to the screen with typical present-day carbon arc projection systems. Curves are presented which enable ready determination of illumination intensities on screens of various widths. Correlation is also made between the various systems and size of screen that can be illuminated to the brightness specified by the applicable ASA Standard."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic or microfilm copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from The Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y., at prevailing rates."
"Television will make wide use of 35-mm and 16-mm motion picture film. The method of televising motion pictures using the storage-type pickup device is described. Theater and television projection practice are compared and methods of meeting proposed RMA Television Standards are discussed. Recently designed 16-mm and 35-mm RCA television projectors are described in detail."
"The increased use of color in motion pictures has brought about a revival of interest in two-color bipack processes. With proper handling, allowing sufficient production time, and good co-ordination between camera, make-up, art, and wardrobe departments, the results with a two-color process are very adequate. — The entire production program of the Hal Roach Studios is in a two-color process. The technical departments have had the advantage of planning for the limitations of a two-color process. This has enabled the studio to obtain the ultimate possible from such a process. This paper describes briefly some of the problems overcome and techniques developed."
"As a service organization for a large number of 16-mm producers in this country, we are constantly impressed with the obvious lack of adequate equipment for making good 16-mm sound. This paper is, in fact, a plea for general improvement in the engineering management and design of sound channels for 16-mm recording. This paper, recognizing the lack of availability of specialized 16-mm equipment, describes the practicability of adapting standard broadcast and disk recording equipment to 16-mm work. This may at first seem obvious, but many 16-mm producers still think that a 16-mm recorder requires a “16-mm amplifier.” An attempt is made to convey to the producer the fact that while we cannot buy new 16-mm recorders and film phonographs, we can surround our present recording units with finely engineered sound channels for recording and reproducing that will represent fine quality for years to come."
"The year 1946, on July 24, marked 30 years of achievement in motion picture engineering and standardization for the Society of Motion Picture Engineers. From its first organization meeting the Society has had as its fundamental aim the standardization of motion picture film, equipment, and accessories from the standpoint of dimensional tolerances, data, processes, nomenclature, and the like which either directly or indirectly might be applicable to the production, distribution, and exhibition phases of the motion picture industry. The early organizers, many of whom are now well-known engineers and scientists in this industry, did at their fist meetings 30 years ago originate proposals to become standards of the SMPE, as the American Standards Association did not exist. These proposals and SMPE Standards were reviewed and redrafted many times before eventually becoming American Standards in the early 30's."
"Among the devices for light control are color filters for separation selection, neutral filters for supplementary control of exposures, and polarizing filters. Polarizers may be used in photography for the control of reflections and for exposure and contrast control of certain surfaces. Among the many uses of polarizers which are of interest in photography is their application to photoelastic analysis. Another application is in the production of special effects in color and black-and-white photography. Of particular interest is the application of polarizers and polarizing photo-materials to three-dimensional photography. — The paper discusses briefly the fundamental mathematics involved in the polarizing effect with particular reference to crossed polarizers."
"Those of you who were present at the Technical Conference of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, held October 1945 in New York, may have heard the several excellent papers presented on the characteristics and early tests of the RCA 1P37 blue-sensitive photocell. This cell was developed at the request of several of the color-film companies to reproduce the dye-image sound tracks which will be associated with certain color motion pictures. These papers appeared in the May 1946 issue of the Journal."
"This paper describes a new 35-mm film recorder designed to meet the operational and performance requirements of the major Hollywood studios. Features which simplify operating the machine are described. Serviceability has been stressed throughout the design, and the many figures illustrate what has been accomplished. Performance compares favorably with any recorder yet built, and values of flutter are presented."
"The new Mitchell 16-mm camera has been designed as an all-purpose double-system camera, suitable for high speed or sound when used in a blimp. This paper describes briefly some of the features incorporated in the new camera."
"During the past year the work of the American Standards Association Sectional Committee on Motion Pictures, Z22, has resulted in the reaffirmation of eight Z22 standards and adoption of fifteen Z52 War Standards as Z22 standards. This is part of a comprehensive effort by the committee to bring up to date all existing Standards and consider any meritorious proposals for adoption as additional standards. Shortly after the end of the war, the membership of the committee was reviewed in order to ensure adequate representation by all interested parties."
"Mr. Bradley: Three to five hundred years for acetate film, at which time it can be copied and perpetuated for perhaps three to five thousand years."
"The Theater Engineering, Construction, and Operation Committee of the SMPE has been formed for the purpose of rendering to motion picture theaters the same type of technical and scientific service that the Society renders to the other branches of the industry."
"Marvin Camras, of the Armour Research Foundation, Chicago, discussed magnetic sound for motion pictures before the Atlantic Coast Section of the Society at a meeting held on January 16, 1947. Mr. Camras described the principles of sound recording using a material having magnetic properties coated in a matrix onto motion picture film."
"This paper presents a preliminary appraisal of flashtubes from the point of view of motion picture studio photography. Such sources have been widely and successfully used for still photography for several years. In this field the short duration and high intensity of the flash, its color quality and high efficiency have been important factors in its favor. Most of these advantages, while equally important in the motion picture studio, cannot necessarily be realized to the same degree in this field. Furthermore, many problems, the magnitude of which cannot be predicted at this time, appear inevitable and will undoubtedly require thorough analysis before a final evaluation is possible."
"Aug. 1926: De Forest brought suit against Fox and Case, charging infringement of the Ries recording and reproducing patents, two of his patents covering the use of a gas discharge for sound recording, and a patent on the use of a light-sensitive cell with an audion amplifier. (De Forest had purchased the Ries recording patent October 15, 1025. He did not, however, actually acquire the Ries reproducing patent until November 16, 1920, although it is believed he held an option on this and several Ries applications before this time.)"
"The history of the sound motion picture industry is told from the point of view of the service organization. Particular emphasis is given to the part played by the service forces in the steady improvement of sound quality to its present standard. — The paper also discusses possible theater problems of the future which service will help solve."
"By action of the Board of Governors. Oct. 4,1931, an Honor Roll was established to perpetuate the names of distinguished pioneers who are now deceased. It is published monthly on the inside back rover OJ the JOURNAL of the Society and now contains seventeen names. In 1946 three outstanding early workers in motion picture sound were approved by the general membership to be added to the Honor Roll, and the high lights of their activities in this field are published below."
"A new 6-mm experimental carbon is described which makes it possible to project 2½ times as much light for 16-mm film as the present 6-mm “Pearlex” high-intensity carbons. A 7-mm “Suprex” carbon offers twice as much light as the “Pearlex” carbon and longer burning life than the 6-mm experimental carbon. Measurements of radiant energy intensity at the film aperture and spectral composition are given."
"The color and persistance of the image formed on the P-7 tube, commonly used on radar sets presenting a map-type picture, make it necessary to employ different films and techniques in making still and motion pictures. Satisfactory motion pictures have been made on reversible Super XX film exposed through a No. 106 Plexiglas filter in a 16-mm camera equipped with a specially designed f/0.7 lens. — Good still pictures can be obtained on fine-grain panchromatic or orthochromatic films at f/3.5 without the use of filters, although the use of a blue filter improves definition by minimizing “ghost” images not yet completely faded from previous scans. — An automatic camera permitting the operator to view the tube while pictures are being taken has been devised."
"Cross-banding of reels between exchange and theater calls for some reform to eliminate the confusion caused by this inefficient method. The paper describes a proposed film lock and immediate identification which becomes an integral part of the film itself."
"The unprecedented volume of Navy combat film photographed during the war presented serious problems of co-ordination, cataloging, and filing. This paper outlines briefly the inception and organization of the U. S. Navy Film Library, the mission of which is the preservation and custody of all Navy Combat Film."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic or microfilm copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from The Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y., at prevailing rates."
"This paper describes the importance of the distribution of American films overseas to the motion picture industry, to the national economy, and to the cause of world peace."
"In the commercial production of two-color prints on duplitized positive film printed from bipack negatives, usual processing methods involve one or more flotation or mechanical application operations in order to prevent the treatment of the image on one side of the film with the color intended for the opposite side. These operations may be slow, difficult to control, and involve considerable waste. A method is outlined whereby a protective coating is applied to one side of the film so that the opposite side may be treated by total immersion to form the proper color for the unprotected image. The coating is then removed, and the previously protected side of the film is treated. The entire process may be done in conventional processing machines by total immersion of the film in the processing solutions."
"The duplicating process has been studied at five Hollywood laboratories. Prints made both by the duplicating process and directly from an original negative have been obtained from all five laboratories. No attempt was made in this study to include the sound track. — A complete sensitometric study was made using both the printed-through technique and customary Type IIb Sensitometer gamma controls for each step in the duplicating process. Resolving-power measurements throughout the various steps in the process were also obtained. — Considerable variation has been found in the degree of fidelity of the duplicating procedure at the five laboratories studied. In most instances it is possible to determine the cause or causes of poor quality by examination of the sensitometric data. Underexposure of either the master positive or the duplicate negative or both is found to be the greatest cause of lack of proper tone reproduction in the duplicate prints."
"The three basic laws of television, i. e., mobility, flexibility, and instantaneity, are best represented in the requirements for a satisfactory lighting system for the video medium. — While the fundamentals of lighting techniques for the stage and for motion pictures remain unchanged, the presently accepted system of remote-control overhead lighting in television relegates to one operator both the control and complete operation of the entire system. By flying the equipment from a unique gridiron, it is possible to keep the studio floor clear for camera operation and stage settings, while from an overhead observation and control position the lighting control engineer can, at a flick of the finger, create and recreate at will the lighting effects required at a given moment. — Television studio lighting has in the past few years moved from the brute-force flat-illumination problem imposed by low-sensitivity cameras to the more specific requirements of the extremely high-sensitivity image-orthicon and orthicon chains. The need for high-intensity mercury-vapor lamps and over-all lighting levels of better than 1500 foot-candles incident has given way to a superflexible system capable of creating the artistic effects now required in studio work. The Tele-Lite of Television Associates, Inc., now installed in three postwar television studios, is typical of this new departure in remote-controlled illumination designed and tested in television broadcast studios."
"Lead-sulfide photoconductive cells developed during the war at Northwestern University show considerable promise in sound reproduction. These cells, in contrast with cesium-oxide phototubes used in present systems, exhibit a much higher signal-to-noise output and a lower impedance. The cell noise is not increased in the presence of background radiation. The frequency response is excellent and the sensitive surface is undamaged by high-light levels. As a result of the high infrared sensitivity of these cells, an indirectly heated exciter lamp has been developed which operates with an ordinary 60-cycle filament transformer. Radio-frequency or direct-current heating of exciter lamps is thus not required."
"A magnetic track deposited between the sprocket holes and the edge of 8-mm film gives good-quality sound which can be added to any ordinary 8-mm film. Modifications of standard projectors for using this system are described. Performances for speeds of 16, 18, and 24 frames per second are given."
"This paper describes a method of re-recording 35-mm sound track to obtain a 16-mm track, which will reproduce synchronously with a 16-mm picture projected at 16 frames per second. The only necessary modification of a standard re-recording channel to perform this operation is the substitution of an 1800-revolution-per-minute synchronous motor for the standard 1200-revolution-per-minute motor on one 35-mm soundhead."
"When deciding on the width in direction of film travel of the illuminated area on the sound track (“scanning width”), a compromise has to be found between two contradictory requirements: more scanning width allows the passage of more light and gives a proportionally higher signal level for low frequencies, but it will cause an increased fall off at higher frequencies, where the scanning width covers an appreciable portion of one wave. Accordingly there exists for each frequency a scanning width with which the signal output is highest."
"A photoelectrically operated cuing system has been developed which avoids the difficulties associated with lack of standardization on edge-notching of film, increases the ease of changing the cuing marks, and also makes feasible concurrent cuing of both light change and special effects. This system has been applied successfully to a standard Bell and Howell Model J printer. However, the features discussed are general and applicable to any type of film-moving system. Spots of white lacquer between the sprocket holes are illuminated by a small beam of light. The reflected light causes a discontinuity in the photoelectric-tube current which is amplified to operate a relay. The printer exposure channel actuates the normal light-change solenoid while the relay in the effect channel is used to initiate fade-in, fade-out cycles through the medium of a magnetic clutch which engages a rheostat in the lamp circuit. Practical operating experience and detailed mechanical features are described."
"The relationship between the area, shape, and fitments of a sound studio or auditorium and their effect on sound quality is discussed. A probable evolution of music appreciation, from the pentatonic and whole-note scales of certain primitive peoples to harmony, as we know it today, is traced. Various methods of acoustical treatment of enclosed areas are described and illustrated."
"In this introduction I should like to set down the purpose of this paper, to say something about the way in which I propose to treat the subject matter contained therein, and perhaps even to make a few personal remarks."
"The history of post-synchronization as a technique is briefly described, with special reference to its use in the process of language conversion. The means by which the illusion of acoustic perspective is obtained within the confines of a limited stage are described."
"The concentrated arc is a new type of lamp whose radiation emitting source is a thin film of molten zirconium and a cloud of excited and ionized zirconium vapor and argon gas which forms on and very close to the end of the specially prepared negative electrode. By modulating the lamp current, the radiation may be modulated at audio frequencies. — The continuous radiation from the molten zirconium can be only partly modulated, the per cent modulation decreasing with increase in modulating frequency and in spectral wavelength. The line radiation from the cathode-glow region close to the electrode modulates almost completely at all audio frequencies. It is particularly strong in the near-ultraviolet and infrared. — By using suitable modulator circuits, which are adapted to the rather unusual impedance characteristics of these lamps, and by using optical filters to select the spectral region used, the light output may be made to follow the lamp current modulation with good fidelity."
"This paper describes a method of automatically silencing the splices on work prints used for rerecording. Holes are punched in the picture area of the sound track by means of a convenient foot-operated punch, at a fixed distance from each splice. These holes then serve to operate a switch in the rerecording head so that the sound output is momentarily cut off while the splice is passing the scanning beam."
"This paper describes three innovations in studio stage construction: (1) Vertical-Lift Stage Separation Doors. These doors eliminate the hinged type formerly used, which required so much valuable stage space. Ease of operation and good sound insulation have been obtained between adjacent stages. (2) A Movable 50-Foot Transparency Screen. A screen has been suspended from a monorail system for storage outside the stage. It can be readily rolled into position in the space normally occupied by the vertical lift doors to permit large screen transparency shots to be made between two connecting stages. (3) A Vertical-Lift Disappearing Bulkhead for a Stage Water Tank. A hydraulically lifted bulkhead has been designed which permits a large sound stage to be quickly converted into a 7-ft deep tank."
"A method is described for electronically modulating small incandescent light sources to stimulate the effect of gas flame flicker and light emanating from a fireplace. The effect produced is more natural than can be obtained with dimmer and flasher methods and is entirely automatic."
"During the war it was not possible to obtain annual progress reports as has been the custom, and up to the present time it has not been possible to obtain progress reports in all fields covering the war period. However, some reports have been prepared and are presented here, with the hope that publication of annual reports of the Progress Committee may be resumed in 1948."
"On Nov. 8, 1945, the chairman of the SMPE Standards Committee appointed a Subcommittee on 8-Mm and 16-Mm Projector Sprockets with the task of revising the present American Standards for sprockets. The personnel of the subcommittee is Otto Sandvik, chairman; Herbert Barnett, John A. Maurer, Lawrence T. Sachtleben, and Malcolm G. Townsley. This paper, however, is not a report by the members of the subcommittee, but is material prepared for their consideration. — The ASA Sectional Committee on Motion Pictures, Z22, had earlier referred the sprocket standards to the Standards Committee for reconsideration, suggesting that the specifications should be in equation form. In this paper, the authors have followed this procedure and are submitting proposals for a new standard, as shown in Fig. 1. Formulas are given for the root diameter of the sprocket and for the thickness and shape of the tooth. In these formulas due allowances are made for variables such as the pitch of the film, the path of the film, and the number of teeth on the sprocket. Careful consideration is given to lateral dimensions. — Members of the Society and others interested in sprocket design are urged to read this paper and Dr. C. F. Vilbrandt's paper, beginning on page 521 of this issue, and to submit their comments to Boyce Nemec, SMPE Engineering Secretary."
"With the advent of 16-mm motion picture film into the educational and commercial fields has come the demand for increased projection film life. At the same time, to avoid loose, unsatisfactory winding of the large projection rolls in use today, higher windup tensions are required. In this paper the effect of windup tension on projection life of the film is described and compared with the effect of feed tension. The importance of the relationship between sprocket pitch, film pitch, and film wear is discussed."
"A television performance must not suffer interruption. Adequate manuscript treatment, technical perfection, and production teamwork are required. The “preset principle” employed by Don Lee Television is described. Large stages are employed with production auxiliaries overhead. Twelve or more sets can be constructed, dressed, and lighted on a single stage, if required. — Duplicate equipment is cited as important in enabling commercial television to approach the production perfection afforded by the cutting process in motion picture. — The need for a trained, co-operative production crew is emphasized with a hint of the human behavior necessary to attain this end."
"Lighting is the most important phase of the cinematographer's art. But the technical aspects of lighting should require only a minimum of time and thought. By adopting simple controls of illumination contrast, brightness range, and exposure, the cameraman will know at any time how close he is working to the limits of film latitude and will be able better to obtain consistent results from scene to scene and from day to day. — This paper describes a new incident-light exposure instrument which also performs the functions of a light-intensity meter and a brightness meter by means of interchangeable light collectors and suitable calibration."
"The photographic work involved in “Operation Crossroads” was the largest project of its kind undertaken by the Armed Services to date. The highly successful character of this operation is based on the quantity of equipment available and the co-operation of all branches concerned. The technical and scientific aspects of the undertaking are described in the following paper."
"A power amplifier which provides high-quality performance because of the utilization of negative feedback over three stages is described. The mechanical design presents a novel and convenient front service arrangement."
"Sixteen-millimeter projection is becoming more and more professional in its application, and it is beginning to be judged by professional standards. One characteristic of 16-mm projection which needs improvement is the sharpness of the projected image. A method is presented for describing the shape of the focal surface; the departure of this surface from a plane explains a great deal of the lack of sharpness in the image. The contributions of the elements of the optical system and the design of the gate are discussed."
"The problem of briefing American fliers on bombing missions over Japan was acute from the standpoint of accuracy and time. Motion pictures were prepared in advance of missions, showing course, target area, visible landmarks, and return course. As part of this project, motion pictures of a radar scope were simulated. Not only was an accurate replica of a scope portrayed, but these films were rapidly produced. The process is described in the following paper."
"This is an intimate, chronological account of the author's experiences as a partner of the world's leading travelog exponent, Burton Holmes. Their first meeting is described in 1893 as well as their world-wide wanderings through the years up to 1917, and the problems encountered in devising camera, developing, projection, and film-printing equipment in those early days. The period from 1917 to date is concerned with the establishment of the Burton Holmes Films Laboratory, the theatrical release of a weekly travelog for six years, and the author's invention and manufacture of 35-mm and 16-mm printers and automatic light-control boards."
"The Chief of Naval Photography recently conducted a survey to determine to what extent the various bureaus and offices of the Navy utilize photography to record, supplement, and document the information and findings of test, research, and development projects. This paper is a summary of that survey. Reports received indicate that motion picture photography is a primary tool in Naval research and testing procedures, and the methods and techniques by which photographic equipment and principles are adapted to the test problems are as many and as varied as the projects themselves."
"A physical transmission meter was built in which both the diffuse and the specular transmission of a film sample could be measured successively at the same point on the film. Q factors computed from these data are plotted as functions of the diffuse density. No base nor minimum density correction is made and hence the computed Q factors are effective rather than absolute values. A few examples are given showing the result of making such base density corrections. Data are given on a wide range of both picture and sound negative and positive materials. In each case, phototubes and filters were selected to simulate the effective range of spectral light used in the practical usage of the material."
"A description is given of a measuring method and measurements for ascertaining the sensitivity of different types of phototubes, viz., cesium-oxide, gas-filled, and vacuum phototubes, cesium-antimony vacuum phototubes, and selenium photovoltaic cells, as a function of the temperature of the light source (tungsten ribbon lamp). The results are compared with the surface brightness of the light source as a function of the temperature."
"A method of tilting and controlling the tilt of the microphone during the “take” is described. The narrow vertical pattern of the unidirectional microphone makes control of the vertical angle of incidence desirable."
"Two microscopes are described for plant control of the dimensions of 35-mm cine film. One microscope measures the transverse dimensions of film such as width, width pitch, and the centering of the perforations. The other microscope measures length pitch and its variations from perforation to perforation."
"This paper describes the development and use of a new titling device which was developed for use with 16-mm and 8-mm cameras to facilitate the making of titles and special effects."
"The three most recent American Standards to appear in the new format are 222.10,222.16, and 222.22. The first two concern Emulsion Position in 16-Mm Silent and Sound Projectors, respectively, while the third is on Emulsion Position in 8-Mm Silent Projectors. With the exception of titles, which were brought up to date, they are identical with the previous standards which carried the 1941 approval date. The absence of change might imply that the emulsion-position situation has remained static over the intervenening years, but this is far from being the case. Actually, the question of whether the film emulsion in normal l6-mm projection should face the screen or the light source has been the subject of considerable discussion, particularly as regards sound release prints. Sixteen- and eightmillimeter silent films are a parallel problem but they are less important economically and are far less critical from a technical viewpoint, so whatever is adopted for 16-mm sound will probably be adequate."
"The problem of educational responsibility is outlined, particularly the aspects concerned in the enormous increase in scope of man's environment during the past hundred years. The means for becoming acquainted with this expanded environment are discussed and the place of audio-visual teaching aids in this broad over-all picture is examined."
"It is obvious to even a casual observer of fourth-decade twentieth century living that much must be done—soon—if the democratic way of life is tò survive — But the ideal has never been achieved; education, in its broadest sense, has failed; and Americans, instead of participating actively in their government, are falling into the terrifying complacency of letting others think for them. One of the educational answers to this crisis is the motion picture. Nontheatrical films represent perhaps the-last avenue of communication not already controlled by special interests; moreover, as an educational tool, film is simple, fast, universal, and democratically sound."
"As an educational instrument the sound film is particularly effective for influencing people in groups, bringing to bear factors in social as well as individual psychology: social facilitation, the impression of universality, and prestige. The physical conditions under which its message is received and the absorption of the audience in the continuity of the screen story polarize the attention almost to the degree of hypnosis, with corresponding effect upon the subconscious and memory. Little intellectual effort is required to comprehend the meaning of visual-action images when coordinated with spoken words. The appeal to the emotions is equally strong through the control of empathic responses by means of meaningful real-life situations dramatically portrayed. Self-identification by the audience with the screen characters and subject matter provides vicarious experience, short-cuts the learning process, and arouses the will to believe or to act."
"The production of motion pictures for training presents distinct reasons for techniques different from ordinary documentary or factual film methods. This is true whether the visual aid is produced during the stress of wartime requirements, or for training in industry, or educational fields in normal times. There are problems in (1) set construction, (2) camera angles, (3) selection and rehearsal of talent, and (4) editing tempo. After producing nearly 100 training films, the author has a background to present the reason “why” for the distinct pattern followed in training-film production."
"The theory of light production in the high-intensity carbon arc is discussed, together with a description of the phenomena associated with the initial striking of the arc and the maintenance of the electric discharge through the arc stream. The formation of the positive carbon crater is described and the factors defined which determine the maximum current loading which a particular carbon electrode will support. The importance of efficient heat dissipation from the positive crater region in extending the useful current range of a given-sized carbon is pointed out, and the effectiveness of water cooling in providing better heat dissipation at this point is noted."
"This paper describes a theoretical method for determining motion picture screen light in a carbon-arc projection system, employing light measurements made directly on the arc crater from various angles of view. The opportunity is thus afforded to study the performance of a given carbon-arc source in optical systems having a much wider variety of collecting angle, magnification ratio, and optical speed than could possibly be assembled for actual optical-bench tests. In this way, it is hoped that the selection of the best possible optical system for a given arc will be facilitated, and vice versa. — Examples of the application of the method to the 8-mm “Suprex” carbon arc at 70 amperes, and to the new 13.6-mm super-high-intensity carbon arc at 290 amperes are given. In each case the analysis has been extended for illustrative purposes over a wider range of optical systems than is of present practical interest. However, the general conclusions thus made possible were considered of sufficient theoretical interest to justify this otherwise impractical consideration. For instance, it is indicated that, particularly with the larger crater, the greater lumen pickup of a high collecting angle does not always result in more light on the screen. — Such practical checks of the method as have been made to date, comparing screen light measurements in complete optical systems with the values predicted by the method, indicate a useful order of accuracy for optical-design purposes. However, the limited scope of these checks is recognized, as is the fact that the calculations do not take screen color variations with focal position into account. — It is hoped that this paper will stimulate others to carry on this same type of analysis, and that the foundation will thus be laid for the most effective combination of carbon arcs with the associated optical systems."
"Equipment designed to accomplish eardrum and other macrophotography is described as well as the construction and functional operation of equipment for photomicrography."
"Special photographic equipment and techniques have been developed for motion picture photography of the human air and food passages. These films graphically visualize the vocal cords, windpipe and bronchial tubes, and the esophagus from the mouth to the stomach, to provide unusual clinical records that are invaluable as teaching and research material. — The camera developed for this work permits constant visualization through the bronchoscope for finding and focusing as well as during the actual filming."
"The application of the acoustic-impedance concept to the study of sound absorption has made it possible to explain and predict the performance of acoustical materials more completely. This paper reviews the theoretical and experimental work done on this subject in recent years and cites some applications to the design of commercial materials."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic or microfilm copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from The Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y., at prevailing rates."
"These standards cover all types of indoor and outdoor potheads for alternating-current circuits (See Table 4 for voltage ratings). Potheads and component parts shall be capable of withstanding the tests specified in these standards, when mounted for testing in accordance with arrangements specified in the Test Code."
"Presents the title page of the proceedings record."
"This, the eleventh volume of the Digest of Literature on Dielectrics, covers the calendar year 1947, and it is hoped that it will set the pattern for the preparation of future issues of the Digest by calendar years."
"Presents the table of contents/splash page of the proceedings record."
"In the year 1947 the trend in the field of dielectrics has been toward the use of higher frequencies, both as to application and theoretical studies of dielectric systems. Many of the constants of dielectric phenomena formerly obtained by extrapolation, have now been experimentally investigated at these microwave frequencies. The designers of measuring equipment have been concerned with making instruments of greater precision and versatility. On the practical side high-power sources have been developed in the centimeter-wave region bringing about a new era in dielectric heating consideration. Dielectric loss measurements of gases at these high frequencies and reduced pressures have led to the flourishing field of microwave spectroscopy. In the field of breakdown studies of solids, the tendency has been toward a more thorough investigation of the temperature dependence of breakdown strength and direction taken by the breakdown paths. The influence of polyatomic molecules on breakdown strength and corona of gases has also been given attention. The ceramic industry has shown continued interest toward the development of electrical insulating materials with lower losses at higher frequencies. Some stimulation in this direction has resulted from the use of ceramics as vacuum tube insulators at the microwave frequencies. Paper insulation research has progressed along such varied lines as lowering of power factor, impregnation with semi-conducting liquids, effects of oxidation, and statistical analysis of conducting particles. Perhaps the most significant trend in the field of synthetic plastics has been concerned with the use of polymeric plasticizers for the vinyl type resins. These plasticizers are much less susceptible to migration and are immune to vaporization loss as compared with conventional plasticizers."
"The general and theoretical section of this Digest includes, with certain exceptions, mainly the type of material included in last year's Digest under the heading “Electrical Properties of Matter.” The exceptions are items on Methods and Instruments, Dielectric Breakdown, and Microwave Phenomena; each of which has a section of its own this year. In addition, it has been agreed that material in the rapidly-growing field of “Semi-Conductors,” will not be included in the Digest this year."
"In the preparation of this report it has been difficult to segregate in the literature the components which fall within the scope of instrumentation and measurement. With no precedent as a guide, since the committee has not attempted in other years to divide the subject along the same lines, it has been necessary to choose the material rather arbitrarily. We have therefore looked first for new instrumentation, and second for new applications of previously existing instruments and methods of measurement. Papers which report data on measurements of properties of dielectrics, but which do not emphasize methods, are not discussed."
"A digest of the papers on dielectric breakdown published in 1946–47 is given in Volume X of this series under the subtitle “High Voltage Phenomena”1. At a symposium on dielectrics held in 1946 at Bristol University by the Faraday Society, Prof. A. von Hippel contributed a paper summarizing the results of previous work on dielectric breakdown in solids, and indicating the nature of existing problems2. The following paragraphs are concerned essentially with the contributions to this subject published in 1947, but it will be convenient to describe the background very briefly."
"The investigation of microwave phenomena in gases has in the year 1947 grown into a flourishing field of research, with more than fifty papers and letters published by more than a dozen laboratories. The field can be divided into two main divisions: (a) the investigation of the absorption of microwave energy by gases, and (b) the investigation of electric discharge phenomena at high frequencies."
"Papers on the subject of microwave dielectric measurements and their interpretation which were published or received in this country in 1947 are reviewed below. It is interesting to note the large number of foreign contributions in this field. The trend in the design of measuring instruments reveals definite advances in their precision and versatility. The results of microwave dielectric measurements have substantially aided our -understanding of dielectric phenomena, especially those involving polar molecules. On the practical side high-power magnetrons have been developed along with techniques for using microwaves in dielectric heating."
"The year 1947 reflected a continuing trend of the ceramic industry toward the development of electrical insulating materials with lower losses at higher frequencies. Low loss ceramic-to-metal hermetic seals play a vital role in the efficient operation of vacuum tubes at microwave frequencies, consequently a great deal of attention was directed to the investigation of suitable sealing materials and techniques."
"The most significant publications appearing in 1947 were the papers given at the first two series of Symposia on Insulating Oil sponsored by Subcommittee IV on Liquid Insulation of ASTM Committee D-9 on Electrical Insulating Materials. The first series was held at Altantic City on October 16, 1946 and the second series was also held at Atlantic City on June 17, 1947. All of the papers together with the discussions recorded at the meetings were published during 1947 in the ASTM Bulletin.(1.2) The symposia were, in general, concerned with the review and discussion of possible ways of improving the life of insulating oil in electrical apparatus and also with the development of laboratory tests and means of evaluating new oil, or oil for continued use for electrical insulation purposes. It will be possible in this review to give only a general idea of the scope of the papers and the discussions."
"It is shown that when certain dielectric liquids are mixed with certain semi-conducting liquids in various proportions the power factor of paper insulation impregnated with these mixtures goes through a minimum. For example, cresol, a semi-conducting liquid may be mixed with tricresyl phosphate, a dielectric. The power factor of Kraft paper insulation impregnated with such a mixture is lowest when the blend comprises about 25% cresol and 75% tricresyl phosphate. Clark has studied a number of other mixtures of semi-conducting and dielectric liquids and finds that minimum dielectric loss coincides with a resistivity of impregnant in the region of 1 × 107 to 2 × 107 ohm -centimeters. The dielectric constant of such mixture is high. Kence capacitors made with impregnants of this sort have a higher ratio of capacity to physical volume than those impregnated with chlorinated diphenyl though power factor is higher and dielectric strength lower. Moreover, it is possible to use a single sheet of tissue with these mixtures and capacity is not dependent upon the spacing of metal electrodes. This latter, it is explained, is due to the impregnant acting as a liquid electrode and, therefore, only the paper thickness is the determining factor. Data are presented to show that the power factor and capacity of this new type of capacitor are stable with respect to temperature change and under applied potential both continuous and intermittent."
"The 1946 Tariff Commission report shows a total production of synthetic resins for that year of approximately one billion pounds, exclusive of cellulosics and synthetic rubber. There was a time when the electrical industry constituted a major outlet for synthetic plastics and provided strong stimulus for the development of new plastics. In fact, much of the drive for the development of polystyrene in this country came from the fact that this material was an outstanding dielectric substance which should demand considerable use in the electrical industry. It is difficult to tell what fraction of current polystyrene production finds its ultimate use in the electrical industry, but the fraction must be small. A similar case prevails with polythene, whose large scale development arose from an urgent war-time requirement for a dielectric material. However, it is safe to predict that the non-electrical peace-time uses for polythene are already or will dwarf any dielectric applications. While these two important plastics, polythene and polystyrene, were both stimulated primarily on the basis of electrical properties, yet the character of the plastics industry has so changed in magnitude and outlook that it will probably be difficult in the future to encourage plastics developments solely on the basis of their possible use in the electrical field. Protective coatings, synthetic fibers, molding powders and structural materials are such large volume ventures as to attract the major research effort. If the hew materials developed for these fields happen also to possess good electrical properties, so much the better."
"The question of the supply of natural and synthetic rubber and their uses in electrical insulation continues to be an important one. In the country as a whole, the proportion of synthetic rubber used fell to about 42 per cent in 1947. About 80 per cent of the rubber used in electrical insulation was synthetic, since this material is preeminently adapted to this use. It would have been still greater had not a shortage of GR-S developed. This shortage was caused by the premature closing by the Government of some synthetic rubber plants."
