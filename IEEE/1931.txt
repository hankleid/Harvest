"Daily average variations of sun spots and field intensity are not simply related. What mostly occurs are the effects which vary as the period of the sun's rotation and one-half thereof. Phase relations are generally found in about 180 degrees and 90 degrees. There is no indication of different effects between daylight and darkness waves. The relation between their monthly average variations is, in general, not obvious. However, direct relation is observed on some stations in summer, whereas inverse relation is noted in winter in several cases, the relation being less clear in the latter season. Daily average variations of terrestrial magnetism and field intensity are also not simply related. However, field intensity usually reaches its maximum from two to four days before the day of occurrence of magnetic disturbance and then gradually decreases until it reaches its minimum from two to four days after that day. There is also no indication of different effects between daylight and darkness waves. The relation is not clearly found for monthly average variations."
"Using the electrical properties obtained by the higher atmosphere on account of the ionization caused by the ultra-violet radiation of the sun and the corpuscular rays sent out from it conclusions are drawn about the height where electromagnetic waves are reflected and the reflected amplitude. In this way results can be obtained in good agreement with the observations. The influence of hydrogen in the upper atmosphere is discussed. Finally the reflection time for a signal is calculated."
"The author has brought to the attention of the editorial staff of the Proceedings the following corrections to his paper, \"An Analysis of a Piezo-Electric Oscillator Circuit,\" which appeared on page 641 of the April, 1931, issue of the Proceedings. In equations (31) and (32) the factor \"Re/Le\" is corrected. This error, which unfortunately was not discovered until after the proof had been returned to the printer, modifies the conclusions reached in the paper in the following particulars: 1. The magnitude of the correction term σ becomes of the order 10-1 instead of 10-13, and hence cannot be neglected. When it is taken into account, Ho is not independent of y and it is found that the region in which an effective vo2,/sub>/Vm exists is further narrowed down. Qualitatively, however, the conclusions reached in the text require no modification. 2. The magnitude of tg θ is not constant-in the region considered and for the example figured is about 0.7 when oscillations begin (with increasing x), and about 0.3 when they cease. Outside of the range of oscillations on either side tg θ has larger values."

"A description is given of equipment which has been constructed for the measurement of radio frequencies between 5000 and 30,000 kc. The equipment consists of a million-cycle quartz-crystal oscillator as a standard of frequency, means for producing harmonics and subharmonics of this frequency, and means for combining voltages of these known frequencies with a voltage whose frequency it is desired to measure so as to produce beat frequencies in successive stages, the beat frequency produced in each stage having one less digit than that in the preceding stage. A calibrated electric oscillator is used to measure the frequency of the last stage. An indicator gives the frequency of the unknown after a series of dial adjustments. The precision of a completed measurement is estimated at better than three parts in a million."
"In the present paper the harmonic components of the antenna current are determined in terms of the corresponding components of the plate current of the power amplifier of transmitters. After investigating the cause of harmonic currents and pointing out the difficulties arising in connection with an exact calculation of the harmonics of the field strength, the discussion is confined to the effect of the circuits inserted between plate and antenna circuit on the suppression of harmonics. Several types of circuits are considered and the current ratios of the harmonic antenna currents with respect to the fundamental are given. For better comparison, the results are tabulated. It has been found that, in general, the suppression of harmonics as given by the above ratio is proportional to the product of the volt-amperes in each individual circuit of the network and to a power of the order of the respective harmonic. Moreover, a general law has been derived, according to which for a given total volt-amperes of the whole filter network the optimum number of individual circuits can be determined. Finally the advantage of the push-pull amplifier and another circuit which inherently compensates harmonics has been discussed and also the detrimental effect of the distributed capacity of the coupling device which provides an undesired path for the harmonics has been described."
"The effects of various changes in both tube and circuit conditions have been investigated with regard to their influence on the limitation which fluctuation noise sets on the sensitivity of a receiver. It is concluded that for minimum noise the following conditions should obtain: The gas pressure in the tube should be less than 10-4mm of mercury; the antenna-to-grid transfer circuit should be as efficient as possible; the plate-circuit load impedance should be high enough to give a gain of at least five for the first radio-frequency tube apart from the antenna coupling circuit; and the cathode emission should be high enough so that the tube is always operating under dense space-charge conditions."
"With P. P. Eckersley's general theory derived from north European practice as a starting point, the possibilities of broadcasting in the United States on frequencies around 200 kc are examined from the viewpoint of national coverage. It is shown that Eckersley's curves can be applied approximately to the American terrain, and that as a first approximation seven low-frequency transmitters radiating at maximum power levels between 1000 kw and 10,000 kw may be expected to cover practically the entire country with true broadcast service. Objections to and advantages of such a structure operated as a supplement to existing broadcast facilities are discussed."
"In this article formulas are given for the calculation of the effective height of coil aerials with non quasi stationary distribution of current. Aerials of triangular, rhombical, rectangular, and pentagonal forms, suitable for use in radio beacons, are treated, and the method of taking account of the distribution of current along the aerial found by experiment discussed. Graphs for facilitating numerical calculations using the formulas are given, together with examples illustrating their use. Special attention is given to the determination of those forms of aerials in which the wire is most advantageously placed for obtaining a maximum of effective height."
"The design of an automatic time-delay relay is described. For certain types of mercury-rectifier tubes no plate voltage should be applied for at least one-half minute after the filament current is turned on if the peak inverse potential exceeds 2100 volts. During a six-months' test of this relay on a special radio transmitter it has not failed to function at any time."
"It is pointed out that the principle of similitude in the vibrating periods of an œolotropic elastic body has several useful applications. As an example the case of X-waves in X-cut quartz plates, is discussed."
"This paper discusses the theory that normal long-distance short-wave communication is broaght about by a series of refractions and reflections. It shows how, if we know the \"range/best wavelength\" characteristic for ranges which entail only one \"hop\" of the rays, we can predict the best wavelength for any larger range necessitating a number of hops, it being assumed that propagation conditions, such as ionic distribution, remain the same throughout all those ranges. Single-hop characteristics given by the author in a previous paper are ased in this way to derive the characteristic for longer ranges in daylight. The result is in close accord with a curve given by Lloyd Espenschied which shows the result of actual experiment over long ranges. For conditions of darkness the present theory cannot be fully tested owing to incompleteness of the data over short ranges, but general agreement is indicated. It is shown that the theory helps to account for the phenomenon of \"fading,\" and for dissimilarities in reception at stations situated a few miles apart, but both receiving from the same sending station. Suggestions are made as to future research. It is thought that multiple refraction and reflection is the most satisfactory explanation of the effects met with in the course of ordinary short-wave communication at long ranges."

"The difficulties encountered in loud speaker measurements are briefly reviewed and a description of the acoustic features of a particular indoor measuring system is given. Outdoor testing arrangements are described whereby double as well as single radiating loud speakers are measured with negligible ground reflection error. It is pointed out that the over-all electrical fidelity curve of a radio receiver is an inadequate performance index; the electro-acoustic fidelity embracing the frequency response of the loud speaker is suggested as more informative. The interpretation of loud speaker response curves in terms of what one may expect to hear is discussed. Reponse curves shown and discussed include the following: (1) Effect of type of cone corrugation. (2) Comparison of radio receiver cabinet with fiat baffle. (3) Curves showing that the face dimensions of a box baffle are of equal importance with the path length from front to rear of cone in determining low-frequency response. (4) The effect of extreme length in a box baffle. (5) Measurements of the same loud speaker in cabinets of different size. (6) Over-all electro-acoustic response curves of radio receivers. (7) Loud speakers with improved high-frequency response. (8) Some examples of outdoor measurements."
"The author presents a method by which audio outputs five to ten times the usual output of a tube of a given size may be obtained with the same plate voltage, lower average plate dissipation, and no serious effects on the tube. The above results are obtained by using the tubes in such a manner that advantage is taken of the essential features of the class \"B\" amplifier. An amplifier of this type' was developed for use as a source of high audio power for plate modulation of a broadcast station and may be applied to any system requiring a relatively high audio output from a minimum of equipment. A discussion of the class \"A\" and class \"B\" amplifiers with diagrams illustrating the operation of each class will be given to set forth some of the essential operating features of these amplifiers."
"Considerable data on radio transmission have been obtained the past few years in connection with the establishment and operation of various radio-telephone services by the Bell System. It is the purpose of these notes to present certain aspects of some of these data which may be of interest in the development of a general physical picture of radio transmission and in indicating the effects of disturbances accompanying storms in the earth's magnetic field. The general results which are arrived at are: 1. Neglecting short time fading, the maximum field strength received at a given point for frequencies up to at least 4 megacycles are in general agreement with those calculated by the inverse-distance law and the minimum field strength (over-water transmission) are in approximate agreement with those calculated by the Austin-Cohen formula. 2. There appears to be a daylight absorption band in the neighborhood of 40 kilocycles (North Atlantic transmission) which reduces minimum daytime fields in that vicinity below the minimum limit given above. 3. The effect of solar disturbances is to increase the absorption to \"sky wave\" transmission throughout the entire radio-frequency spectrum generally and to reduce or eliminate the 40-kilocycle absorption band thereby increasing daylight fields for transmission on frequencies in that vicinity."
"A comparison of reception measures with meteor showers over five-year periods indicates an accompanying increase of night fields and a decrease of day fields. The highest correlation appeared between monthly means of meteor hour rates and night fields. No associated disturbance of terrestrial magnetism was found."
"The French government radio authorities began transmitting daily Ursigrams from the Eiffel Tower (FLE) in Paris, on 1 December 1928. This service has since been regularly maintained and extended to corresponding daily emissions from FLY Lafayette Station near Bordeaux and FYB Paris-Pontoise. Both emissions are made at 20.30 GMT and in clear (uncoded) French language. Commencing with 1 August 1930, there has been a regular daily Ursigram emitted in code, from the US Navy Radio Station NAA, Washington, DC, under the auspices of \"Science Service,\" Washington, USA. It has been the aim of the Liaison Committee of the URSI to distribute information concerning these Ursigram services to many interested persons and groups. It has similarly been the aim of the American Section Committee on Cooperation to aid in the same task. The work also discusses proposed British Ursigram, projected changes and extensions in the French Ursigrams, projected extensions in the American Ursigrams, and meetings of the US National Comittee on Cooperation."

"This paper discusses some of the more important principles involved in the development of the directional transmitting antennas at present employed in the Bell System short-wave facilities. The theoretical performance of directive arrays is presented by means of various curves which have been obtained by integrations based upon Poynting's theorem. The details of the mathematical derivations are omitted for the sake of brevity, but the general procedure and the resulting formulas have been placed in an appendix. Various practical problems encountered in the development are described. These include antenna tuning procedure, transmission line adjustments, and sleet melting facilities."
"The study of electromechanical vibrating systems through the measurement of motional impedance was first undertaken by Kennelly and Pierce in 1912, in their work on telephone receivers. The method was applied by K.C. Black in 1928 to the study of ferromagnetic rods centrally clamped and lying along the axis of a coil carrying alternating current superposed upon direct current. The work of Mr Black was done on rods of nickel, stainless steel, and stoic metal (invar steel), and also on nickel tubes. The natural frequencies of the rods he studied lay between 2300 and 3000 cycles per second. The present paper describes similar measurements carried out on rods with natural frequencies near 30,000 cycles per second. The study was made on rods of nichrome, monel metal, stainless steel, stoic metal, and nickel. The dependence of the vibratory characteristics on rod diameter was determined by making measurements on a nickel rod, as its diameter was reduced in successive steps. The rod was annealed before each set of measurements, by heating to redness and cooling in air. Another nickel rod cut from the same bar was bored axially with concentric holes of successively larger diameter, and measurements made at each step. This was done in an endeavor to determine something about the flux distribution across the section of the vibrating rod. The effects of annealing, and of changing the number of turns on the alternating-current coil (in which the rod was supported), were investigated. The effect on the vibratory characteristics of varying the alternating magnetic field on the rod was also measured."
"Equations considering the effects of output and distributed capacities and primary resistance are developed for radio-frequency transformer-coupled amplifiers using either a tuned or an untuned primary. These equations are transformed to such a form that they may be compared with the well-known equations derived for an untuned primary neglecting the output and distributed capacities. The equations for an untuned primary are verified experimentally. It is shown that the amplification obtainable with a tube and a transformer having an untuned primary may be made nearly uniform over a frequency range such as that covered by the broadcast band by adding resistance to the primary to reduce the high-frequency amplification. It is also shown that the addition of primary resistance reduces the selectivity approximately the same percentage as it reduces the amplification. The selectivity of a stage with a tuned primary is found to be approximately the square of the selectivity of a stage with an untuned primary."
"A special alternating-current generator, a photo-audio generator, is used to good advantage as a source of current for measurements of variability with frequency. Compared with the known audio generators (tube generator with or without superposition) hitherto used for the same purpose, the photo-audio generator has the advantage of greater simplicity. The sources of error, as regards sine shape of its potentials and the variability with frequency are so small that they need not be considered in practical measurements. The described arrangement is so adjusted that the frequency range in question is continuous, and the result of the measurement is shown as a curve drawn by a recording instrument."
"In Part I of this paper, the performance of piezo oscillators of the usual Pierce circuits is treated, on the basis of the resonance curves of the quartz (taken experimentally) and with the help of vector diagrams. In Part II, the influence of the decrement of the quartz resonator on the oscillation frequency is examined. This study has led to the development of an arrangement which permits the quartz to oscillate in proximity to its frequency of resonance and to reduce thereby the influence of the decrement on frequency to about 1/10 of that usually found."
"The operating frequency of regenerative oscillatory systems is quantitatively derived in terms of the natural frequency, the damping constant, and the phase of the driving force. As an example the results are used to calculate the change in rate of a pendulum clock due to a given variation in the phase of the driving impulses. Applications to other types of systems are briefly indicated."
"Since the publication of the above paper in the December, 1930, number of the Proceedings of the IRE, the attention of the authors has been called to two articles on the alternating-current resistance of solenoidal coils, by S. Butterworth, which they regret to state were overlooked in the preparation of the original paper. In the first of these articles (Phys. Rev., 11, 752-755; June, 1924) Butterworth has explained the disagreement of results, calculated by a formula derived by him in 1921, and the experimental results of Hickman (US Bureau of Standards Scientific Paper No. 472) as being due to a misinterpretation by the latter of the scope of this formula. The measurements of Hickman were carried out with long coils, while the constants in the formula cited apply only to coils whose length is less than their diameter. Butterworth shows that, properly extended, his formula correctly represents Hickman's experimental values of the resistance ratio. In the second of these articles Butterworth gives the derivation of this extended expression, formula together with that of two other formulas. In conclusion, the general agreement of the above-named paper's measured values and the values of resistance ratio computed by Butterworth's formulas may be regarded as satisfactory in all cases where the assumptions of the formulas are fulfilled. For a more rigid comparison, measurements are necessary with coils of more open winding and with greater attention paid to obtaining uniformity of spacing over the length of the coil."
"B.J. Thompson in the above referenced article (ibid., vol 19, pp 421, Mar 1931) makes the following statement - \"Hull and more lately Nelson have analyzed the conditions for stability in terms of the maximum amplification per stage, ignoring the allimportant effect of feed-back on amplification.\" He evidently did not understand the significance of the symbol Av in either of the above articles. The effect of feed-back has not been ignored in determining the conditions for stability. The voltage amplification Av is not the amplifaction realized with a tuned input but is the amplification obtained with an untuned input or the true repeater gain of the stage, which quantity may be easily measured. The desirability of expressing the results in terms of Av is discussed."
"Summary form only given, as follows. Review of \"Radio Theory and Operating,\" by Mary Texanna Loomis. Fifth Edition, 1006 pages with 803 figures (price $4.25. Loomis Publishing Company, Washington, DC, USA). This is an elementary book treating a great variety of radio subjects, as well as other subjects closely related to radio. The strong points of this book are the many circuit diagrams, charts and tables, descriptions of modern applications of radio, especially those of popular interest, amateur and commercial operating, and receiving set trouble shooting. In the discussion of elementary electricity and magnetism and principles of radio, which consume many pages, the treatment is superficial and unsatisfactory. Errors and incorrect uses of scientific terms are prevalent."

"The authors briefly describe the results of a number of experiments with frequencies above 30,000 kc covering a period of several years. Since the major interest of radio communication companies has been in long-distance communications, this paper includes some qualitative data covering propagation beyond the optical, or direct vision, range. The authors have found that the altitude of the terminal equipment location has a marked effect on the signal intensity, even beyond the optical range. Frequencies. below about 43,000 kc appear to be reflected back to earth at relatively great distances in the daytime in north-south directions, but east-west transmission over long distances is extremely erratic. Frequencies above about 43,000 kc do not appear to return to earth beyond the ground wave range, except at rare intervals, and then for only a few seconds or a few minutes. These frequencies, which do not return to earth, also appear to be free of echoes and multiple path transmission effects. Therefore, they are free from distortion due to selective fading and echoes. The range is also limited to the ground wave range, so these frequencies may be duplicated at many points without interference. As the frequency is raised, the range tends to approach the optical distance as a limit. Experiments with frequencies above 300,000 kc have, so far, indicated that the maximum range is limited to the optical distance. A number of possible applications are suggested, based on the unique properties of these frequencies."
"The automatic color organ, a by-product of radio, produces colors by means of music and synchronizes colors with music. Acoustic power on the order of microwatts controls lighting power of hundreds to millions of watts, which is varied in accordance with rapid fluctuations of the input."
"This paper describes the results of the simultaneous operation of radio stations WHO and WOC broadcasting the same program on a common frequency using independent crystal controlled oscillators. These stations had previously been compelled to share time on 1000 kc and each is now able to render full time service. The exceptional stability of the crystal controlled oscillators used at each station is described. Since even these oscillators require occasional readjustment to maintain them in isochronism, a monitoring receiver was established midway between the stations and the resultant program is sent back by wire line to WOC to provide an indication for readjusting its frequency to exact isochronism with WHO. An audio oscillator used to modulate the carriers in the monitoring receiver provides a tone independent of the program for the guidance of the operator. Curves are presented showing the quality impairment caused by different degrees of isochronism and signal strength ratios. The improvement in distance reception with simultaneous operation is reported and an explanation given. The impaired reception in the area midway between the stations and outside their normal service range is shown to be a function of the degree of modulation of each transmitter, of the field strength ratio and of the audio phase angle and independent of the carrier phase at the transmitters. It is pointed out that reception equal to that from either station alone may still be obtained in this area by the use of a simple directive antenna."
"Following a brief review of general methods of measuring radio-frequency power in the antenna, a series of tests on a particular transmitter operating from 4000 to 26,000 kc is described. These tests indicate that it is reasonable for such a transmitter continuously variable in frequency and of fairly modern design to be expected to put not less than 50 per cent of its input plate power of the last stage into the antenna as radio frequency from 4000 kc to 8000 kc and not less than 32 per cent at 24,000 kc. Intermediate efficiencies are indicated for the intervening frequencies. Coil losses and stray losses have been separated and the indications are that with modern insulation a moderate increase in efficiency can be expected in a transmitter designed for as high L/C ratio as possible, which is particularly feasible in the case of a transmitter operating on only one frequency. Marked increases in efficiency in the upper end of the spectrum can only be expected by the use of tubes better adapted to the upper frequencies."
"A new type of frequency meter is described which is adapted to the measurement of low and intermediate frequencies. The instrument absorbs a negligible amount of power from the circuit being tested, has a linear calibration curve and a sensitivity of about eight microamperes for one per cent change in frequency. An experimental model is described in detail. The input to this model is between five and ten volts. Other models may require different inputs."
"The comparison of power output, distortion, power sensitivity, and a-c/d-c power economy of a group of experimental pentodes is made with corresponding triodes. The apparatus and method of measuring are described. The pentodes' a-c/d-c economy and power sensitivity is considerably higher than that of the corresponding triodes. The harmonic distortion is found to be generally worse with the pentodes. The variation in power output with changes in load resistance, arbitrarily called \"output distortion,\" is shown to be about the same for both classes of tubes. The need of a large capacity shunting the bias resistor in a self-biased pentode amplifier is shown. Its effect on power output and power sensitivity is discussed. In the conclusion, five types of distortion occurring in triode and pentode operation are compared. The principal use for the pentode appears to be with battery and 110-volt d-c types of receivers."
"Part I of this paper discusses the relative importance of the factors which limit the intelligibility of short-wave radio telephone communication. The more important of these factors are inherent set noise, external noise (static, etc.), and signal fading. The possibility of counteracting these limitations through antenna directivity is indicated. Part 2 describes an antenna system which maintains a desirable degree of directivity throughout a broad continuous range of frequencies. The cost of this antenna is more favorable than that of many types of fixed frequency antennas of equal effectiveness."
"In this paper are given a number of measurements which show time variations in the virtual height of the ionized regions of the upper atmosphere. These measurements were usually made simultaneously on two frequencies, 1604 kc and 3088 kc. Single frequency data are also given. The following are the main points of interest presented. (1) The data indicate the existence of two distinct ionized regions or layers. The changes in virtual height are sometimes very abrupt. The existence of the lower layer even at night is indicated by an occasional return to low virtual heights during this period. (2) Experimental evidence has been found of large retardations in group velocity near the critical conditions for which the waves just penetrate the layer to the point of maximum ionization. (Fig. 1.) Absorption is especially marked at such times. (3) Except at these critical periods the records for the simultaneous transmissions show that the virtual heights of the upper layer are greater for the higher frequency than they are for the lower frequency. This statement would probably hold for the lower layer but no evidence on this point is presented. (4) In the discussion several possible methods of two-layer formation are suggested, one of which involves the formation of negative ions in the region between the layers."
"The paper gives the results of a large number of field strength measurements in which the relative radiation characteristics of the transmitting and receiving stations remain constant even on changinig their distance. The constant of attenuation as a function of the wavelength was determined for the propagation of waves over land from these measurements. The method used eliminates the errors in the absolute determination of the received field strength. The attenuation values that were obtained were used for the calculation of the received field strengths as a function of wavelength and distance in two examples (long-wave Zeppelin and long-wave airplane station). We see that it is more important to use a long wave over land than over water. The best waves as regards propagation and radiation can be deduced from this work. The dependence of the internal efficiency of the antenna circuit and of disturbing reflections on the wavelength must be considered especially carefully. The results of the work make possible the numerical calculation of the range of radio waves over land in the wave band between 200 and 2000 meters. They should be more reliable than the rule-of-thumb methods hitherto used."
"It is shown that there are two methods for calculating the radiation of antennas and antenna systems. One depends on the consideration of the electromagnetic field produced by the radiating system, that is, on the integration of the Poynting vector over a surface enclosing the system. The other is based on a consideration of the electromagnetic phenomena on the conductor itself. The identity of the two methods is demonstrated. The second method is much simpler to treat formally and gives clearer results. The calculation of the radiated power is especially simple, using a law that provides a connection between the radiated power and the Hertzian vector for the system under consideration. This hitherto unknown law is derived. The radiated power of any arbitrarily loaded antenna and of short-wave antenna systems with parallel elements is calculated by means of this law."
"A simple method of harmonic analysis is applied for a-c waves with certain properties. Curves having such properties often occur in audio-and radio-frequency applications in the form of so-called \"characteristics.\" This paper presents a graphical method of finding the amplitudes of the harmonics by working directly from the \"characteristic.\" For obtaining the results, a polar planimeter is used. The design of a new mechanical harmonic analyzer is based on this method. In general, this method is a special case of a method of harmonic analysis formerly found by English and German authors."
"It is shown that the three constants of a triode, i.e., amplification factor, internal resistance, and transconductance, can be represented by one point in an equilateral triangle logarithmically scaled, and the author gives, as an example, a graph in which are plotted the constants of twenty-four kinds of typical tubes nou used in practice."

"There is a need for upper air meteorological observation at night as well as in the daytime, in cloudy and in foggy weather as well as in clear. This need has given rise to a number of interesting methods of obtaining these data, among them radio tracking of meteorological balloons. A free balloon moves in the air current prevailing at the level it occupies. A small rubber balloon, six inches or less in diameter, when inflated with hydrogen to a given excess lift will rise at a given ascensional rate to great heights. Successive determinations of the position of one of these pilot balloons provides ready means for computing the mean direction and speed of the wind in the layer of air through which the balloon has risen during the interval between determinations of position. On clear days these balloons have been followed by visual methods to heights of 20 miles. This paper deals with a radio method of determining successive balloon positions. A light transmitter, weighing about a pound, is carried up by the balloon at a known ascensional rate. Loop receivers are employed in ranging for this transmitter. The whole project involves the determination of air temperature aloft as well as air movement but the work on it so far has been limited to the development of equipment needed for the observation of wind, direction, and speed. Positions are usually determined at minute intervals."
"The fundamental characteristics of thyratrons are discussed. Comparisons are made with characteristics of high-vacuum tubes to show the outstanding advantages and limitations of the thyratron. Starting characteristics are discussed and typical examples are shown. Several types and sizes of thyratrons are described briefly."
"A transmitter for aircraft employing cw telegraph signals only is unusually effective in performance and economical in operation. By employing a special method of screen-grid modulation, phone signaling can be provided for use when phone signaling is most needed-namely, when flying in the vicinity of airports-with almost negligible additions to the cw transmitter. A rapid transfer of information is mostly needed at or near an airport. Short-range phone signaling provides for this need. When flying on regular courses, telegraphy is rapid enough. Cw telegraph signals remain 100 per cent intelligible under conditions which would be near O intelligibility for the same power phone signals."
"A form of tuned-reed radio range beacon course indicator is described, called a reed converter, in which the course indications are not given by observing the two reed motions as heretofore, but by means of a zero-center pointer type indicating instrument. The motion of the two reeds generates small alternating voltages, which when rectified by oxide rectifiers and passed in opposing polarities through a zero-center indicating instrument, serve to give course indications by the deflection of the indicating instrument needle in the direction of deviation of the airplane from the course. Each reed converter unit consists of a polarized reed tuned to one of the beacon modulation frequencies. The reed vibrates between a set of driving coils which are supplied with the signal from the radio range, and also extends between a set of pickup coils, and generates a voltage in these coils. Since a null method of course indication is used, it is necessary to provide a signal volume indicator in the form of a 0-500 microammeter in the output circuit of the oxide rectifiers. Several forms of converter selector switch circuit arrangements are shown. The advantages and disadvantages of the reed converter as compared to the tuned reed indicator are discussed."
"The purpose of this paper is to point out that many advances in acoustical engineering have been necessary in order to understand and control adequately the conditions under which modern sound pictures are recorded and reproduced. To illustrate this point, some of the acoustical problems encountered at Bell Telephone Laboratories are discussed. The sudden and successive changes in sound intensity level to be expected in a room during the growth and decay of sound from an intermittent source are pointed out. The necessity of using the more general reverberation time formula, which was developed over a year ago, when dealing with coinparatively \"dead\" rooms, is indicated. One type of acoustical distortion which is due to interference is discussed together with the measures necessary to minimize it in sound pickup work. These phases of acoustical engineering have been selected for discussion from many which confront the engineer in this field."
"The daylight radio transmission conditions across the North Atlantic Ocean in 1930 for wavelengths of 10,000 to 20,000 m (15-30 kc) are shown in a table based on the daily observations of the signal strength of seven European high power stations taken in Washington. It is expected that similar tables of daily transmission conditions for the years beginning with 1924 will soon be ready for publication. The object of this form of tabulation is to furnish a ready means of comparison of radio conditions with other natural phenomena-sun spots, magnetic storms, weather, etc."
"This is an apparatus paper describing equipment recently developed for low frequency (17.8 kc); intermediate frequency (770 kc); and high frequency (6942.5 kc) field intensity recording. The circuits employed are presented and discussed with particular reference to expedients for obtaining nearly logarithmic scales (when used with Leeds and Northrup recording potentiometers). Typical records obtained with the aid of the equipment described are presented and the salient characteristics of the high-frequtency records (which show striking evidence of skip distance phenomena) are pointed out."
"Transmission conditions for each season are shown by \"surfaces\" giving the received field strength as a function of time of day and frequency. These show that frequencies near 18 mc are best for daytime transmission. In summer the best frequencies for nighttime transmission are those near 9 mc. In winter an additional frequency near 6 mc is required during the middle of the night. A frequency (such as 14 mc) intermediate between the day and night frequency is useful during the transition period between total daylight and total darkness over the path. Day-to-day variations change the periods of usefulness of these frequencies. In particular the period of usefulness on 14 mc sometimes extends so that it is the best daytime frequency. Transmission conditions on undisturbed days were found to be the same for the same time of year on different years. These undisturbed transmission conditions are presented by \"normal\" surfaces. Comparison of these surfaces shows that the higher frequencies are less attenuated in winter. Reception on the highest frequency, 27 mc was best in winter; in summer this frequency was never heard. The effect of solar disturbances on short-wave transmission is to reduce reception on all frequencies. Sometimes the higher frequencies are the more adversely affected. Some of the, possible causes of these disturbances are discussed. From the measurements made on \"static\" at New Southgate, data on the variation of its field strength as a function of frequency, time of day, and season are given."
"Neglecting the short-range ground ray, it is assumed that short-wave propagation is due to single or multiple total reflection between the earth and one or more ionized layers in the atmosphere. For single reflection at a single layer an equation is developed giving the wavelength in terms of the skip distance, the height of the layer and the degree of ionization of the layer. The curve represented by this equation is discussed. The equation, in conjunction with experimental data, shows the height of the layer which governs the skip distance in daylight to be about 230 km, and its ionization about 7.0×105electrons per cu. cm. It is thought that, in daylight, higher layers of greater ionization do not exist. But there may be lower ones of lesser ionization. The theory is then applied to the case of multiple reflection in daylight. The data lead to a value of 10.4 meters for the shortest useful wavelength for daylight work. The case of two or more layers is next discussed, and experimental data for darkness are used, by means of the theory, to estimate the structure of the ionized regions at night. On winter nights there appear to be at least two layers, one at a height of about 520 km and with an ionization of about 2×105electrons per cu. cm, the other at a height of the order of 40 km and with an ionization of the order of 3.5×104electrons per cu. cm."
"Variation in received field intensity of long radio waves is compared with variation of temperature, pressure, and rainfall during the passing of general storms at Washington. The results show that in general there is a definite falling off in signal intensity in front of the advancing low. This is followed by an increased intensity which persists from one to two days after the storm center passes. This indicates some real relationship between received signal strength of long waves and weather over that part of the path of the wave over which it passes shortly before reaching the receiving station."
"Exact formulas for the wave function and vertical electric field at the surface of the ground are derived for a vertical dipole of zero height."

"The paper consists of three parts, I-Induced Potentials, II-Direct Hits, and III-Other Effects. The work of previous investigators is briefly reviewed, and the limitations of their premises pointed out. Under Part I a generalized theory of ideal ground wires is offered, which takes into account the law of cloud discharge, the distribution of bound charge, and the formation of traveling waves. It is found that the protective ratio is independent of these factors. A more extensive theory taking the additional factors of successive reflections and tower resistance into account is then developed. Part II discusses the probability of a line's being hit, and applies a method for computing the effect of successive reflections to the calculation of potentials on the line and ground wires. Curves of these potentials at successive towers, and as functions of tower resistances and of time, are given. Part III discusses the effect of ground wires on attenuation, telephone interference, zero phase sequence reactance, corona, and the reduction in surge impedance due to the introduction of extra ground wires. There are three mathematical appendixes. In Appendix I, Maxwell's electrostatic and electromagnetic coeficients are reviewed, and the theory of traveling waves on any number of parallel wires is developed, including the behavior of these waves at rather general transition points. While this extension to the theory of traveling waves was developed incidental to the study of ground wire theory, it is believed to be of considerable interest and value on its own account."
"An experimental investigation of the influence of polarity on high-voltage discharges is reported in this paper. Particular attention is given to those discharges used in high-voltage measurements. A theory of the formation of Lichtenberg figures is given together with experimental evidence upon which it is based. A polarity indicator utilizing visual Lichtenberg figures is described. Results of 60-cycle and impulse tests on various types of gaps are given. It is shown that polarity has a distinct effect upon the sparking voltages of all types of gaps. Impulse measurements with grounded sphere-gaps are shown to be subject to serious error unless the polarity effects are taken into consideration. An explanation of the influence of polarity on spark-over is proposed."
"Corona loss measurements were made on seven different conductor specimens. The losses were measured directly, on a three-phase line 700 ft. long, by means of three single-phase high-voltage wattmeters. The object of the test was to obtain data for the choice of conductor to be used on a 220-kv. 60-cycle line. The results show the effect of weathering of conductors, the comparison of conductors of two different diameters, the effect of size of strands and the method of stranding and also the effect on new conductors of the change in surface conditions caused by rain and washing."
"Porcelain insulators have been manufactured and used for the transmission of high-tension electric power for forty years. The first designs were of the single-piece and multipart cemented pin type. Necessity for higher safety factors against flash-over and increase in operating voltages demanded a rapid increase in the size of the insulators. This reached an economic limit at the operating voltage of 66 kv. The suspension unit overcame this temporary check of increased operating voltage. Further study of the electrostatic capacitance of the various parts and consequent voltage distribution, made marked refinements in the pin type insulator possible. During this time the single-piece porcelain suspension unit took practically its present form. Early improvements were the provision of proper expansion joints and the separation of the lip of the cap from the porcelain hood. Gradual improvements have since been made resulting in a great increase in mechanical strength. These changes have been principally in hardware design. By experiment and analysis the shapes of the cap and pin have been determined to give a uniform distribution of load from the pin to the cap. Constant check tests by the quick pull and time loading methods have shown that the suspension insulator with properly designed hardware and a suitable coating on the cap to prevent the cement from adhering to the metal, has a high strength associated with electrical reliability. Ceramic research and exact manufacturing control has made possible the production of non-absorbent, thoroughly vitrified porcelain of consistent strength."
"Improvements in steam power generation and economic changes in the fuel supply have caused increasing interest in steam power on the Pacific Coast. After a brief history of the development of steam power on the system of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the author discusses some of the fundamental factors entering into the problem of providing additional steam plant capacity for this company in accord with the changed economic conditions. The author describes recent work completed and under construction and gives some of the economic results obtained and expected."
"The question of grounding transformer bank neutrals through different impedances has recently arisen due to the desire to limit system single-phase and two-phase short-circuit currents. This limitation has been required to ease the duty on circuit breakers and assist in maintaining system stability. The use of resistance, inductance, and various combinations has been studied as to the effect on the short-circuit current and particularly upon lightning transients within the transformer windings and at the neutral. It was found that the use of resistance only may be undesirable on account of the high voltage at the neutral in limiting the short-circuit current. The use of inductance only may result in high voltages within the transformer and at the neutral due to lightning transients, which necessitates that the transformer be fully insulated throughout. Methods using parallel paths with the inductance, these parallel paths being designed primarily to reduce the lightning transients at the neutral, have been studied and found to limit the transients within the transformers to values approximating those for solidly grounded neutral which permit the grading of the transformer insulation. The method to be selected depends upon the individual case, but generally the use of the valve type lightning arrester is the simplest to apply."
"Research investigations conducted by engineers as well as physicists during the last few years have resulted in notable improvements in the mercury arc rectifier, in particular with reference to backfire protection and voltage regulation as well as improved manufacturing methods. These improvements made it possible to build rectifiers of very large current capacities as well as for very high voltages. The basic principle of rectification is briefly reviewed in order to explain the results obtained with the aid of these improvements. Methods of testing rectifiers have also been improved on and new ones developed. Standard parts are now used for different rectifiers up to the largest capacities. An account is given of notable recent rectifier installations for city subway service, for a portable street-railway substation, radio transmission, electrolytic zinc refining, and for Edison systems."
"A record of the application of protective relays on the system of the Southern California Edison Company, Ltd., is presented. The history of this development of the protective relays in the 220-kv. transmission line, together with the results of the application of protective relays is recorded. In view of the limited application of carrier current protection, considerable discussion is presented covering its application on a section of the 220-kv. transmission system. Allied considerations pertaining to system stability on the 220-kv. system are discussed, and the rearrangement of the 66-kv. system as a means of improving system stability is also presented. In the interest of improving service, certain changes on the lower voltage 16-kv. and 11-kv. systems have been made."
"This paper gives a general description of the Southern California Edison Company's communication system which not only meets the requirements of load dispatching but also serves to bring about close cooperation between the outlying district forces and their directing heads at division headquarters and in the general office. Decentralized dispatching which makes possible the restoration of service after an interruption without the immediate need for commnunication is touched upon. The detail of the development and construction by the Company of the ``Serjdetour'' arrester is made public for the first time. This piece of equipment has made possible a protective system which not only prevents damage to valuable communication equipment in stations for the extreme case of actual contact between telephone lines and power lines but also preserves continuity of communication service after power system disturbances which create surges of considerable magnitude on inductively exposed telephone lines. A brief outline is presented of the standardized assemblies of telephone equipment into units which are adaptable to wide variations in requirements by the use of different combinations and quantities of standard units. The communication building where the telephone system centers is described, together with the methods of handling traffic through this point. A brief description of the testing equipmens for initial tests on new lines and maintenance of existing facilitiet is given together with test results on a typical line 279 miles long."
"This paper covers the electrification program of the Pennsylvania Railroad and consists of a brief explanation of the reasons for the decision to embark on this electrification program, a review of the operating experiences leading up to the present designs used on the railroad, of catenary and transmission circuits, substation layout and types of equipment, as well as a description of the progressive steps of electric locomotive design which preceded the development of the electric locomotives to be used in this program, and concludes with a brief resume of the points that should be given attention in applying an electrification to a stretch of railroad."
"This paper is intended to describe the electrification of the world's largest open cut copper mine, and also covers briefly main line transportation and miscellaneous uses of electrical energy at the concentrating plants, that are located approximately 18 miles from the mine. This electrification project was an economical and progressive step in copper mining and developed some very interesting engineering problems. Electric shovels, both alternating and direct current, together with the special type of electrical locomotive required for this particular service, are discussed. The rather elaborate trolley and feeder system required to transmit power to a fleet of 23 electric shovels and 39 electric locomotives, scattered over a 725-acre area, is described. The main power system, together with mill, railway and shovel substations, is briefly described. Some operating statistics are given, to assist in visualizing the magnitude of the operations."
"The paper deals with the change brought about in hydroelectric practise by the introduction of the high-speed low-head propeller type of turbine. For a given head, up to about 70 ft., it is possible to run the units at a much higher speed, thus reducing materially the cost of the generator. The maximum efficiency of the unit is maintained and the part load efficiency greatly improved by the use of adjustable blade turbines, so that there is also a material gain where variable load or flow is to be handled. The fundamentals underlying the design of an adjustable blade propeller type turbine are given and an illustrative study made of a three-unit station, to show the gain in output obtainable from this type of unit."
"This paper describes the recent trend in design of large water-wheel driven generators. New features of mechanical construction made possible by fabricated designs are particularly emphasized, and illustrations of some recent machines are given. The 77,500-kv-a. generators for the Dnieprostroy project in Russia, which will be the world's largest hydroelectric generators, are described. In conclusion, some of the future possibilities, such as outdoor machines and multi-speed designs, are discussed."
"This paper deals with the great importance of economic division of load between various units in a hydroelectric plant and the proper combination of units for any given output allowing for the proper reserve required. It points out that in the past, the attempt to achieve ideal economy of operation has been handicapped by the human element. The duties of the average operating force are usually such that the constant maintaining of accurate loading schedules for best economy is a physical impossibility when the usual manual operation is employed. The solution for this problem has been found in the development of the ``automatic operator'' designed specially for each plant through the combination of the preparation of ideal schedules, of economy of operation adapted to the particular system requirements and the installation of special automatic control equipment which permits the rigid enforcement of these ideal schedules. The actual application of the automatic operator and the results obtained in the Norwood Plant of the Carolina Power & Light Company and the Morony Development of the Montana Power Company are fully described."
"The severity of unsymmetrical system faults is affected by the negative sequence impedance of the connected machines. These impedances in turn depend largely upon the character of damper windings. The paper discusses the effect of amortisseur or damper windings upon both the real and reactive components of the negative sequence impedance. Machines without damper windings possess the highest negative sequence reactance and from this viewpoint are the most desirable, but machines with high-resistance damper windings possess the highest negative sequence resistance. Calculations show that combining the effect of resistance and reactance, the high-resistance damper is more desirable. In the event of system oscillations low-resistance copper damper windings produce the greatest damping of the mechanical movement. However, this effect is unimportant during and following a system fault except in the exceptional, rather rare case in which the system is so constituted that pull-out takes place as a result of compound oscillations following a disturbance. Consideration is also given to a special type of double deck damper winding."
"This paper describes the switching equipment and its arrangement in an outdoor switching center at 132, 66, and 12 kv., in connection with an installation of three-winding transformers. This installation is a junction point on an interconnected system, from which energy is distributed at the lower voltage. The development of the original 12-kv. installation with indoor type of equipment enclosed in metal housings and concrete cells is described. The reasons leading to its extension with metal-clad oil-filled gear are also discussed. A feature of this metal-clad oil-filled installation is that it is laid out on an isolated phase basis with wide separation between phases, which is the first time that this arrangement has been attempted with this type of equipment. Included in the design are complete facilities for grounding and testing of the equipment, which are fully interlocked to insure maximum safety in their use. A brief discussion of costs as compared with indoor installations is also given."
"The drive unit of this system consists of a constant speed a-c. motor supplemented by an adjustable speed d-c. machine of much smaller size. Both rotor and frame of the a-c. motor are mounted on bearings. The d-c. machine is mechanically connected to the frame of the a-c. motor so that the d-c. machine may drive or be driven by the frame. The d-c. machine is electrically connected through a motor-generator set of equivalent rating to the source of alternating current energy. The shaft speed of the a-c. motor is increased above the fixed speed by rotating the frame of the a-c. motor in the same direction as the rotor. The shaft speed is decreased by rotating the frame in the opposite direction. The direction of rotation and the speed are governed by adjusting the voltage impressed on the armature of the d-c. drive machine by the generator of the motor-generator set. When the unit is used to drive fans, the speed range is obtained by a combination of armature voltage control and field control of the d-c. drive machine. This permits a still further reduction in the rating of the d-c. drive machine so that for comparatively wide ranges of speed it forms but a small percentage of the total drive unit rating. Twenty-four units of this type, aggregating 7,020 hp., are now being built for Powerton Power Station for driving forced and induced draft fans."
"Voltage regulation on transformers under sustained load has made rapid strides in the last eight years and found very wide application in extended power systems and on industrial loads. Originally it was found economical to equip only very large transformers for load ratio control, using apparatus designed for high currents. This paper describes, and compares with earlier developments, a novel equipment of low current rating, that has been devised especially to control small blocks of power, thereby greatly widening the economic field of application of load ratio control. The electromechanical features of this equipment are stressed particularly."
"Experience has shown that the forces on turbine generator armature windings during short-circuit conditions are large. The windings may be seriously damaged if adequate consideration is not given to the design of the coil bracing and support. In this paper the forces are calculated for a particular case by the use of images, by the change of flux interlinkages, and by the ∫ H2 d s over some surface in air which surrounds the conductor under consideration. A new and relatively simple proof is given for the validity of the latter method. The limitations and desirable applications of each method are considered. Forces on conductors in armature slots are computed when saturation is considered, and when neglected. Approximate formulas are derived for the forces on coil sides within one layer of the conical end winding, and for the straight coil extensions from the slots. A numerical example is given in each of those cases. The applicability of certain of these formulas to the phase connecting rings is pointed out. The force on the entire conical surface of the end winding is discussed qualitatively. Certain desirable features of end winding bracing are mentioned. In most of these cases, the instant considered is that following a line-to-neutral short circuit when the maximum possible instantaneous current is flowing."
"This paper describes the problems attending the laying of eight 75-kv. submarine cables across the Delaware River in the vicinity of Wilmington. To insure against injury the cables were laid in a backfilled trench, the depth of which was determined from experiments. By terminating the cable on platforms just inside the pierhead lines it was possible to use a cable of 4,050 ft. (maximum length one of the accepted manufacturers could make) as compared with a river width of 5,100 ft. To avoid excessive heating of that portion of the cable out of water at the cable platforms, the steel armor was replaced by one of nonmagnetic material so designed to avoid corrosion and electrolysis. The problem of laying the limited lengths of cable in the trench with minimum deviation was satisfactorily met with specially developed methods. The construction work was completed in five months under winter conditions and heavy river traffic."
"This paper shows the conditions affecting the magnitude and rate of rise of recovery voltage at the terminals of an oil circuit breaker upon interruption of a short circuit, and explains their effect in quantitative terms. Factors are presented whose numerical value takes into account the number of phases involved in the short circuit and the ground connections of short circuit and generator, the decrement of short-circuit current previous to interruption, and the effect of unequal reactances in the direct and quadrature axes of synchronous machines. It is also indicated how to take into account the effect of displacement and of initial load current, and the effect of saturation is discussed very briefly. Magnetic oscillograms are presented which verify the most important of the points brought out. The most common locations and a rough idea of the magnitude of the capacitances affecting the rate of rise of recovery voltage for various types of short circuit are indicated. Calculations of the recovery voltage curve for several representative cases, at both low and high voltages, are presented, and in some cases cathode ray oscillograms are presented for comparison with the calculated curves. While no systematic data appear to be available at present regarding the effect of the rate of recovery voltage rise upon circuit breaker operation, several tests showing a very pronounced effect, some of them made by the authors and some by others, are reported briefly."
"The Reading Company is now electrifying its Philadelphia suburban railroad service and facilities are planned so that the electrification may readily be extended to include through passenger and freight service between Philadelphia and New York City, Bethlehem, and Reading, Pennsylvania. Contract has been made with Philadelphia Electric Company for initial power requirements, and provisions are made for enlarging such supply to serve all of the above territory. The Railroad Company is constructing substation and transmission facilities to serve the suburban territory by a 12/24/36-kv., three-wire, single-phase, 25-cycle distribution system, with the view to serving the more remote area by superimposing 66-kv. transmission lines upon the initial system, at the time of future extension. The present and proposed system layout is described, together with the estimated power requirements and the manner in which the railroad system is to be served from the system of the power company."
"The Broad Street subway is the first step of a system of underground high-speed railways which is being designed and built by the City of Philadelphia. This paper describes the substations which furnish power for traction at 630 volts direct current and for the subway lighting and signals at 4,600 volts, 60 cycles. The first section of the Broad Street subway required three substations which were equipped with synchronous converters and completed in 1928. Later, when the subway was extended, a fourth substation was added, but by this time so much progress had been made in the design of substation apparatus, particularly in respect to increasing the current capacity of mercury arc rectifiers and perfecting iron-clad high-voltage switching equipment, that a radically new design of substation was decided upon embodying these types of apparatus. This substation was placed in operation this year. This paper contains a description of the apparatus and method of operation provided in both types of substations and indicates the advantages of the equipment selected. Much thought was also given to special operating features for safety and reliability."
"This paper describes the energizing and putting into service of the Pennsylvania electrification project. The normal and desirable procedure of placing an electrification into service is cited, and the departure from it brought about by the difficulties encountered in actual railway operation are explained. The operating practice-functions of the power director, his assistants, substation operators, and foremen in connection with switching operations, grounding circuits, carding of circuits, and manner of obtaining releases-is described and illustrated. All of this is very essential to properly coordinate the work and safeguard the personnel of the construction forces, operating forces, and test men during the transition period of completion and placing into operation a railway electrification project."
"The past three years have seen a great increase of activity in the field of alternating current electrification of steam railroads and, consequently, much attention has been given to the design of the single-phase traction motors upon which the success of this type of electrification chiefly depends. The object of this paper is to describe the up-to-date motors which have been developed to meet the requirements of modern American railroading."
"A cooperative electrolysis survey in the city of Louisville, Kentucky, under the direction of an electrolysis committee is described. An analysis of a portion of the survey data and indicated mitigation measures are given as typical examples. The advantages of cooperative action in a general electrolysis survey are shown."
"In the preparation of this article an attempt has been made to show the development or growth of the use of electric power transmission in the lumber industry. More particularly in that branch of the industry that is engaged in falling trees, hauling them to the mill and sawing these trees into lumber units of the size used by builders and manufacturers of finished articles in which wood is the raw material. An attempt has been made to show the general scope to which electricity is used, without including any technical descriptions of individual applications. It was felt that this can be best accomplished by a general description of its use throughout one of the most recently constructed and most modern manufacturing units in the Pacific Northwest."
"The paper deals with the development of the design of the single-phase series motor and some of the main features in both electrical and mechanical proportions which determine the service capacity in the application of this type of motor to railway electrification. Intensive study and development begun in the early part of 1927 resulted in the production of a singe-phase series motor with more than enough capacity to meet the present day requirements of the American railroads. A brief description is given of this motor and of some of the novel features which made this recent progress possible. Since this motor was developed, built and tested, further possibilities of increasing rating or decreasing the size and weight for the same rating have been found and will result in further progress in the design of the single-phase series motor."
"The cooperative lightning laboratories near Alcoa, Tenn., have been in operation since July, 1928. This paper outlines the purpose of the installation and describes the transmission line on which the studies are being conducted. A background is provided for a more complete appreciation of the technical data which appear from time to time. Conclusions drawn from an operating viewpoint are presented."
"In view of the fact that reactance type distance relays have been in service in this country less than a year, operating experience should be of general interest to the industry at this time. This paper presents the performance record during the 1930 lightning season of two new types of reactance relays. One of these types is a high-speed American built relay, using a stepped time-distance characteristic. The other relay, using a sloped time-distance characteristic is European built, but designed for a more conventional speed of operation. These relays have performed satisfactorily on long transmission lines with wide variation in short-circuit conditions. The correctness of the reactance principle has been demonstrated. Certain difficulties with these relays have arisen on interconnections operating near the stability limit. Both definite and tentative conclusions from this year's operating experience are included in the paper."
"Airway beacons requiring from 1½2 to 2½ kw., may be lighted direct from low-voltage distribution lines, gas engine-driven generators or from high-voltage transmission lines. The latter requires a high potential transformer of very small capacity, although most standard high potential transformers are made only in ratings of 15 to 100 kv-a. The ''capacitap'' is a potentiometer device similar to that used with condenser bushing terminals, the capacities being composed of suspension type capacitor units. The capacitap will give satisfactory performance for certain types of loads. The device is very well adapted to the supply of power to airway beacons having nearly constant load and approximately 100 per cent power factor where not more than 3 kw. is required. The construction and performance are discussed in detail."
"The application of Y-connected transformers to three-phase, three-wire systems, in such a manner that the third and its multiple harmonics of the exciting currents would ordinarily be suppressed, is not in accordance with the best practise. However, such applications of grounded-neutral, Y-connected potential transformers, particularly to temporarily ungrounded systems, have been made for relaying and other purposes. The resulting complications, which are of a different nature than would be anticipated from the suppression of the third and its multiple harmonics, may not be generally appreciated, so this paper outlines experiences with two such applications. The peculiar and dangerous ``saturation phenomena'' obtained and the methods of preventing their occurrence are described and considerable data thereon included. The phenomena are discussed from theoretical standpoints in companion papers by A. Boyajian and O. P. McCarty and by C. W. La Pierre."
"Experience has established the fact that the neutral of a three-phase system may become subject to certain strange phenomena of instability under apparently normal conditions. The disturbances are of two distinct classes: (1) persistent shift or inversion of the neutral, resulting in unequal leg voltages; and, (2) persistent oscillation of the neutral (with equal effective voltage in all three legs) at approximately one-half, double, or triple frequency. While in the ultimate analysis saturation is at the basis of the phenomena, a more definite explanation is given as follows: 1. Neutral shift or inversion is a fundamental frequency phenomenon, and is due to the fact that the volt-ampere curve of the combination of an iron core reactor (transformer magnetizing current) in shunt with a suitable capacitor has one zone which is lagging and one which is leading. In a Y-Y bank of transformers, with suitable balanced line capacitances to neutral following a switching disturbance, one leg may act leading, the others lagging, and thus invert the neutral. 2. Oscillations of the neutral'tend to take place at its natural frequency, but since, due to inevitable losses, not all oscillations can persist, in course of the starting transient the oscillation is resolved to the nearest lower frequency which is able to draw energy from the circuit by approximating harmonic relationship to it. The even harmonics are accounted for by the persistence of residual in the core, whether left from previous excitation or brought about by the direct current component of starting transient."
"The abnormal voltages considered here are due to the occurrence of a large harmonic of fractional, even, or odd frequency in the line-to-neutral voltages of certain Y-connected transformer circuits. These phenomena were first described before the Institute in 1915, and other papers on the same subject have appeared since. The results of a detailed study of the instantaneous currents, voltages, and transformer flux densities in the type of circuit involved are presented in this paper. From this study the origin and characteristics of the abnormal voltages have been deduced. In general the voltages are found to be self-excited by successive alternate saturations in the transformer cores. The first saturation, which starts the phenomena, occurs within one cycle after the voltage is applied, due to the starting conditions of voltage and residual core density. When coupled with the system capacitance in the circuit of this discussion, each saturation establishes the condition for producing a succeeding and alternate saturation so that the process is self-continuing. The frequency of the harmonic voltage generated by a succession of alternate saturations is dependent only upon the rate at which they occur. It is not surprising, therefore, that harmonics of unusual frequencies have been observed. The wide variations between the initial core conditions in the three transformers result in highly irregular saturations and correspondingly irregular voltages at the start. Such irregularities are of a transient nature."
"Audibility characteristics of the ear and the units used for measuring noise are briefly discussed. A theoretical investigation was made to determine the different force components and other causes of transformer hum. Surface vibration measurements were made on transformer parts to determine the sources which cause noise in transformers and how these noise sources are afected by variations in operating conditions. Noise surveys were made to measure the range of intensities, the frequency characteristics and distribution of sound from transformers in service. The effects of substation acoustic conditions on noise distribution were investigated."
"This paper describes short-circuit tests which were made on a large power system under normal load conditions, in order to ascertain the operating characteristics of the system and the turbine governors during system disturbances. The introduction gives a brief description of the main features of the station and the connected System, a statement of the tests, and a list of the major conclusions. Part I covers the short-circuit tests on the system to determine the stability limits. Part II describes the load transfer and short-circuit tests to produce ``governor pumping.'' Part, III deals with the short circuits which were made to investigate the effect of a special valve mechanism on the stability limits. Part IV contains a discussion of miscellaneous tests, data, and general comments. In appendixes A and B, a detailed description of the system station and test equipment is given with estimates of the stability limits and short-circuit currents to be expected. Appendix C deals with the theory of the change in speed of a rotating body for a given energy differential."
"This paper is a description of the Ohio Falls Hydroelectric Station at Louisville, Ky. The development is a low-head, run-of-river plant and a combined navigation and power dam. The dam is a part of the U. S. Government Ohio River canalization project. Eight units, with a total installed capacity of 105,000 hp. operate on a maximum head of 37 ft. and deliver power to the systems of the Louisville Gas and Electric Company. Several novel electrical features are embodied in the design of this plant. Both automatic and supervisory control equipment is employed and is housed in closed steel cabinets. A miniature switchboard with complete control and supervision of each unit on a panel four in. wide is another new idea that is used in station control."
"Hydrogen has many advantages over air when used as a cooling medium for rotating machines such as reduction of windage losses, increase in available output for a given amount of active materials and the absence of corona effects on the insulation in high-voltage machines. The paper describes a liquid sealing gland developed for use with turbine generators to prevent escape of gas along the shafts. Two 7,500-kv-a., 3,600-rev. per min. generators with hydrogen cooling have been built and tested. The second machine with the control apparatus is described in detail, and the operating performance over a period of 3½ months is given. With the development of suitable sealing glands and control apparatus to the point where reliable operation can be expected over long periods, the use of hydrogen cooling for turbine generators appears to be desirable at the present time in ratings of 30,000 kw. and up."

"A description is given of the cable laid by the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1928 between Newfoundland and the Azores. The plan of this cable is unique in that it consists of a combination of non-loaded and loaded cable, the latter being tapered throughout certain portions. By means of this arrangement it has been possible to secure duplex or two-way operation at a speed of 1,400 letters per minute in each direction. The general methods used in obtaining the duplex balance are described and the fundamental theory of the cable is given."
"The design and operation of long submarine telegraph cables are affected to an important degree by extraneous electrical interference near the ends. The amount of interference in different cases is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which can only be determined by measurements made in the vicinity. The relation is first given between the amount of interference and the operating speed of the cable, assuming the interference to be sinusoidal. This is extended to include actual interference which is not sinusoidal. Since the computations with non-sinusoidal interference are too tedious for general field use, an experimental method is given which provides results which may be used directly in determinations of the effect upon cable operation. Examples are given of the computation of the response of the receiving instrument under the influence of a transient extraneous voltage, the frequency characteristic of the receiving equipment being known. Conversely, examples are given of the computation of the frequency characteristic from the results of an experimental determination of the response of the receiving instrument to a transient impressed voltage."
"In the study of telegraph transmission efficiencies and the analysis of signal distortions a suitable signal recording device is a first requisite. This paper describes a machine developed for the purpose. This machine furnishes a graphical and permanent record of the received signals and shows their relation to sent signals, in a form which is most convenient for comparison and analysis. The unusual arrangement of the recorder is such as to adapt it especially to the study of both characteristic and fortuitous distortions and, in general, to the comparison and absolute measurement of short time intervals. Time intervals of one ten-thousandth of a second in the opening and closing of electrical circuits are graphically recorded without resort to photographic means."
"The central telegraph office of a city is the focal point for the collection and delivery of commercial telegrams within that city and the surrounding territory. This central office is connected telegraphically to the public branch offices within this area as well as to the offices of those patrons who have sufficient telegraph business to warrant the telegraph company incurring the expense of providing such a connection. Printers employing the start-stop method of synchronism have been found exceedingly adaptable for use in circuits providing such telegraph connections, and the telegraph companies are using these printers in increasing numbers for this purpose. The termination in a central office of a large number of these circuits, the majority of which is worked intermittently for the greater part of the time, requires the provision of some means of concentration in order that the traffic may be handled efficiently and economically. This paper describes a multipled turret printing telegraph concentrator designed and used by one of the telegraph companies to meet this need."
"Private wire telegraph service forms an important part of the communications service of the United States. This pape outlines briefly the practises which are followed by the Bell System in furnishing a million and a half miles of such service. Some of the practises discussed are: Central office arrangements, line transmission systems, and station apparatus. The paper closes with a description of a few typical applications for press associations, brokers, police and airways."
"The general trends in telephone and electric power systems are outlined and the reactions of certain of these trends on coordination are described. In the telephone system, brief mention is made of the rapid growth of the dial system of operation, improvements in subscriberstation apparatus, rapid extension of new types of facilities for toll circuits and the growth of connections to foreign countries. Improvements in telephone service increase the importance of securing adequtate coordination. The advantages of the use of cable facilities for toll circuits, of repeaters, and of carrier current systems as regards coordination of long distance and interurban telephone circuits are discussed. The benefits accruing from improved subscriber-station apparatus, central office equipment, abandonment of iron wire for the short tributary toll circuits and new methods of making sleeves at joints in open wire lines are outlined. In the power system, brief mention is made of increasing use of larger generating units, and growing use of automatic devices to replace manual operation. Improvements in power service generally react favorably on coordination. The general trends toward higher voltages for transmission and distribution and the improved standards of construction accompanying these trends are described. The important matter of system stability and the practises as regards grounding of transmission circuit neutrals, lightning control and current limiting devices, and the reactions of these matters on coordination are outlined."
"Because of the necessity of reaching the same customers, electric supply and telephone lines commonly use the same streets and highways. In urban communities, the joint use of poles for these two services has been very widely adopted and practises for joint use construction have been established from experience gained in past years. In rural communities, joint use is not always practicable or economical. Joint use involves many engineering and economic problems which have received the careful consideration of the Joint General Committee of the National Electric Light Association and Bell Telephone System. This paper describes some of the problems which have been encountered in joint use, and briefly outlines the work which is being conducted by the Joint General Committee in connection therewith. It is concluded that in specific cases proposed for joint use all factors should be studied cooperatively by the companies concerned and that everything practicable should be done to facilitate joint use construction and extend its usefulness."
"The impulse characteristics of thyrite station type arresters of various ratings have been studied when connected to a 45-mile transmission line. The surges were supplied by a 1,500,000-volt impulse generator. The volt-timle curves for arresters of various ratings were obtained under the conditions corresponding to the arrester on each incoming circuit, on the bus with two incoming circuits and on the bus with one incoming and one outgoing circuit. The oscillograms were found to check the calculations closely. With the arrester 90 ft. from a nearby tower the effect of tying arrester and tower grounds together was studied, and also the effect on flashover at nearby towers. The effect of flashover at a tower 1,660 ft. away on the operation of the arrester was determined. Oscillograms are given comparing the protective characteristic of a single-stack arrester with that of a two-stack arrester of the same rating. There is no discernable difference between the two characteristics. It has been proposed that line insulation for a distance of one-half mile from the station should be limited. Oscillograms are given for two arrester ratings, showing that, for the waves used, no protection is offered by the arrester at a distance of 2,180 ft. and a large part is lost at 500 ft. It is concluaded that the insulation should be limited at the arrester if the arrester is to protect it safely. The effect of the length of arrester connections is given, showing that on the 69-kv. arrester a loop 30 ft."
"This paper considers the effect of resistance inserted in series with generators during and after a short circuit to increase the transient stability limit. The series resistance loads the machines during a fault and greatly reduces the normal tendency to overspeed. After the fault has been cleared the series resistance exerts a powerful influence in retarding excessive over-swing by taking advantage of the low generator stored energy relative to that of the load center. It is shown that by using series resistance a typical hydro system can maintain synchronism through a three-phase fault with speeds of circuit breaker and relay operation now available. A three-phase resistor normally short-circuited by a circuit breaker and connected into the neutral of each generator provides the most desirable arrangement. The cost will generally be much lower than the combination of other measures commonly taken such as high inertia generators, low reactance of generators and transformers, damper windings, transformer neutral impedance, special simultaneous relay schemes or other remedial measures such as lightning proof lines, and the expenditure can be deferred until it is justified by operating experience."
"The principle of operation of oil circuit breakers has been conceived to the present time as deionization of the arc stream during the time required for the recovery voltage to appear across the circuit breaker terminals. An alternative principle is here developed in which the arc products are swept away by the scavenging action of an oil blast. As a logical development from this conception a new type of oil circuit breaker is described which owes its efficiency to careful provision for a scavenging blast of oil which is driven by the gas pressure from one break and which displaces the arc in the space between the electrodes of another break."
"The purpose of this paper is two-fold: First; to present the theory of traveling waves on multi-conductor systems, and second, to compile a brief compendium on the general subject of traveling waves on transmission systems. While the application of the multi-conductor theory is more laborious than that of the single-wire theory, yet it does not involve much greater complication, and it becomes necessary to go to the more general theory when mutual effects are important, as in the study of ground wires, or when discontinuities exist in paralleled circuits carrying traveling waves. The origin, shape, and general characteristics of traveling waves are discussed. The equivalent circuits of terminal equipment and the corresponding reflections and refractions from such junctions are given for a large number of cases. The methods of computing a multiplicity of successive reflections by means of lattices are described. The effect of line losses in equalizing the subsidence of traveling waves and on their attenuation and distortion is also discussed."
"This paper describes the method followed in separating out the individual waves from the oscillographic record of the voltage at a transition point due to the superposition of several successive reflections. The separation is necessary in determining the attenuation of the waves on the transmission line. In the past it has not been unusual to find the reduction in the crest value of each successive reflection attributed to attenuation, whereas the major cause of such reduction was reflection at the terminal equipment. The paper discusses a class of lattices which offer a simple and convenient means for keeping track of successive reflections, so that the position, direction, and previous history of each separate wave may be ascertained at any instant of time almost at a glance. The reflection and refraction operators are defined and applied to specific examples. A few oscillograms of successive reflections are analyzed and a number of attenuation curves has been plotted."
"This paper presents a description and discussion of a series of impulse tests on two substations of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company's system. The 220-kv. substation of the Roseland switching station was surged through eight miles of overhead line. A study of the effects of various amounts of connected bus and station apparatus was made. The effect of different arrester locations on the protection afforded to the station insulation was determined. The Elizabethport 26-kv. substation was surged through five miles of overhead line and two miles of cable. The effects of various arrester locations, both on the line and in the substation were determined. The attenuation in and surge impedance of the cable were measured."
"The purpose of this paper is to report the results of an investigation made on a wood pole line. The entire line was originally very highly insulated. The splintering of the structures by lightning indicated that excessively high voltages were appearing quite frequently. Because of the high insulation a cathode ray oscillograph station was installed on the line. A total of 38 significant surges was recorded, two of these being a five million and a four and one-half million-volt surge. Analysis shows that these high surges were the results of lightning bolts striking the lines causing faults between conductors but not to ground. The data also indicate that harmful effects are caused only by direct strokes. These and current measuring records indicate that currents varying from very low values to 100,000 amperes may readily be obtained. Two methods of protection are dealt with, one utilizes a fuse, the other an expulsion lightning discharge device. The new device operated eight times, all of these operations being successful."
"A record of the 1929 lightning performance of a 1,200-mile 132-kv. transmission net workis given, and compared with the record of the system during the previous three years. The system is almost entirely of steel tower construction with conductors in vertical configuration; and on most lines one ground wire is employed. It is shown that some 75 per cent of high-voltage transmission line outages on this system are due to lightning. Lightning performance of lines being dependent on the severity of lightning conditions, a record of these conditions should be kept from year to year if records are to be compared. Data are presented on relative yearly lightning intensity, line outages, damage found to insulators and hardware, performance of double circuit lines, lines with and without ground wire, and with two ground wires, and also with and without grading shields. The apparent part tower footing ground resistance plays in line outages due to lightning is also given. The conclusions are drawn that 1. Two circuit lines are far more reliable, from a lightning point of view, than single circuit lines. 2. One ground wire offers considerable protection against lightning, and two ground wires considerably more. 3. Grading shields properly applied do not reduce line outages but decrease the damage to insulators, hardware, and conductors. 4. Both direct and induced lightning strokes have to be considered on these lines. 5. Flashovers do not always concentrate on high tower footing resistance towers. 6."
"Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the application of low-speed synchronous motors to industrial loads requiring both high starting torque and high pull-in torque with moderate starting current demand. The problems encountered are exemplified in the drive of grinding machinery in the cement and mining industries, to which several different adaptations of synchronous motors are discussed. A form of synchronous motor with phase-connected damper winding has been devised for this type of service, developing high-torque / kv-a. ratios in a simple mechanical construction."
"Many present day applications of synchronous motors call for modifications of normal motor characteristics, as regards starting torques, thermal capacity of the starting winding, synchronizing ability, maximum synchronous torque, and mechanical design. The salient-pole motor with squirrel-cage amortisseur winding has advantages over other types which have led to the general adoption of this type as standard. Without abandoning this form, the starting and the synchronous characteristics can be adjusted to meet a variety of requirements by changing the proportions of the design and by using special forms of control equipment. Other forms, such as the synchronous induction motor, the phase-wound damper motor, and the supersynchronous motor, are sometimes justified for meeting strict starting current limitations or for accelerating extremely heavy inertia loads. In the mechanical design of machines for definite space requirements, fabricated construction allows changes in construction to be made at small expense, and often permits motors to be built integral with the driven machine."
"The initial electrification on the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad includes approximately 68 route miles and 158 track miles of line out of Hoboken, New Jersey, and covers the more important parts of the suburban service and a small amount of freight transfer switching. The 3,000-volt d-c. system is used. Power is purchased in the form of three-phase, 60-cycle, high-tension, alternating current delivered by the power companies to five substations owned and operated by the railroad located along the right-of-way. Four of the substations are manually operated and one is fully automatic. Mercury-arc rectifiers are used exclusively for converting the alternating current to 3,000-volt direct current. The rectifiers have excited grids and are compounded to give substantially flat voltage up to 150 per cent load. All d-c. distribution is through the catenary system, auxiliary feeders not being necessary. All d-c. circuits are protected by high-speed magnetic blow-out circuit breakers. The catenary system is of the tangent-chord double-contact wire type supported on steel structures in multi-track sections and on creosoted wood poles on the single track branch. Multiple-unit trains are used exclusively in the passenger service, made up of two-car units consisting of a motor car and a trailer car, semi-permanently coupled together. Motors are insulated for 3,000 volts, are operated in series-parallel under electropneumatic control with automatic acceleration, and are self ventilated. The freight transfer service is handled by two locomotives of the ``three power'' type, arranged for operation from the 3,000-volt d-c."
"This paper gives a simple method of determining the general U and S curves for a catenary system. They are both obtained from the same equation and give the general shape the contact wire must take in order to lie in a horizontal plane. The specific shape the contact wire will take on any curve is found by adding together multiples of the U and S curves. Methods of obtaining the multipliers for track curves of varying radii and for constant radius curves are given. The method used postulates a smooth continuous curve for the contact wire from span to span lying in a horizontal plane. The contact wire does not necessarily have the same shape as the track curve. For a given catenary system the shape taken is determined only by the relative location of the points of messenger support. The condition of design necessary to give a contact wire curve which has practically the same shape as the track curve, is shown."
"The article presents a brief description of the new electrification at Cleveland, Ohio, and the methods used in designing the overhead catenary system. The tangent chord compound catenary is used, the system being quite heavy. The main line construction weighs 3.855 and the yard construction 2.321 lb. per ft. dead load. The main line system is composed of a main messenger, an auxiliary messenger, and two contact wires hanging side by side. The yard system has a main messenger, and two contact wires, one above the other. The parabola formulas were used for the calculations, and where feasible, were made up in the form of charts, illustrations of which appear in the text."
"The paper describes experiments on the arc between metal electrodes in argon and other gases, in which the current was controlled by means of a kenotron. By varying the temperature of the cathode in the kenotron, it was found possible to obtain volt-ampere characteristics of the discharge for the transition from glow to arc or the reverse. It was also observed that in the arc stage, for at least smaller currents, the spectrum of the discharge is characteristic of the cathode material."
"The welding operator may encounter trouble in starting the arc or in having the arc extinguish itself too readily. Those causes of trouble which are attributable to the welding generator are analyzed and explained in terms of generator design. Development of means for eliminating the generator characteristics causing these troubles, is outlined and the results obtained are shown by oscillographic records. Other benefits accruing from this improvement are mentioned."
"A short description is first given of a d-c. generator having characteristics suitable for arc welding. Curves showing performance under steady conditions of load are shown. It is pointed out that for quick changes of load transients appear detrimental to arc welding. In order to eliminate these transients, an external inductive device called a transforming reactor is introduced in the arc welding circuit. This transforming reactor has a dual purpose. First, it depresses the transients as is shown by oscillograms, resulting in quick recovery of the voltage and a small short-circuit current. Thus it is shown that under arc welding load the generator performs in accordance with the curves corresponding to a steady load. Second, the transforming reactor introduces reactance in the arc circuit which, experience has shown, is desirable in order to make the arc stable and therefore easy to handle. The system for d-c. arc welding which is described consists, therefore, of two units,-a generator and a transforming reactor, forming a combination capable of producing uniform welds of high strength."
"Cost reduction calls for a continual revision of methods. The making of motor frames using rolled plate in place of castings formerly used, the object being to reduce cost is one such revision. The method of manufacture is briefly outlined including the rolling, welding, sizing, and other operations. The electric resistance welding method is emphasized and results of electrical tests on equipment are outlined. The oscillograph records give the character of a resistance flash weld in some detail. The conclusion is reached that not only is there a saving in cost of frames, but also a reduction in machining costs. The result is a better product at less cost."
"This paper describes in general the equipment for and process of making brazed joints. The lead soldered joint has been in use for a long time and has done its work well but because of certain inherent weaknesses, it is slowly being replaced by the brazed joint. The electric brazing equipment is listed and a short description of it given. The preparation of various sizes and shapes of work is taken up in detail and a short discussion of the different types of joints is given. Three kinds of brazing mediums are discussed and applications of each are mentioned. A description of the actual brazing process follows and the paper is concluded with a list of advantages of the brazed joint over the lead-soldered joint, including: increased factor of safety, saving in time, reduced cost, reduced size, and increased accessibility of joints for inspection."
"The object of this traffic controller is to keep the signal green on the major street, and to give the green signal to the minor street only when requested. The minor street vehicle can always get the green signal after a short wait, while the major street receives green light for as much extra time as the minor street traffic permits. Two experimental horizontal beam installations, which accomplish the above object, are now in operation in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. The focussed light beam, phototube unit, relay panels, and associated circuits are described in this paper."
"This paper describes a number of tests on commutator machines and slip-rings operating in hydrogen. The results seem to warrant the following conclusions: (1) A commutator machine designed and adjusted for good commutation in air will operate satisfactorily and give good brush life in hydrogen. (2) If a commutator machine mutst spark in hydrogen, the brush life may be increased many times by keeping the relative humidity below, ten per cent. (3) The contact resistance of carbon brushes on a commutator may be lowered materially by the introduction of hydrogen. (4) Carbon or graphite brushes cannot be operated satisfactorily on plain tool-steel slip-rings running in hydrogen, and (5) The contact drop between a carbon or graphite brush and a brass slip-ring may be ten times as high when the ring is ruinning in air as when it is running in hydrogen."
"An outline is given of experiments showing that a sliding-brush-slipring contact, even with well seated brushes, only makes electrical contact at a comparatively small number of minute spots at any given instant. Differences are shown in the properties of the contact film formed on a grooved and on a plain slip ring. Commerical applications of the helical grooves are mentioned. It is shown that a helical groove cut in the face of a slip-ring or commutator has the following effects: (1) It provides a means for forcing a more uniform distribution of current over the brush face, and between parallel connected brushes. (2) It permits the escape of air trapped under a brush. (3) It prevents local spot heating and glowing under overload conditions. (4) It raises the contact drop of the brush, producing better commutation and cooler operation. (5) In some cases, an increased brush life."
"The series circuit consisting of an inductance L, capacitance C, resistance R, and a source of alternating electromotive force, where the circuit elements are all linear, is regarded as a special case of a more general type of circuit in which L, C, and R may be functions of the current or other variables. The practical importance of these non-linear circuits is noted and some of their properties are reported. In the series circuit with a linear resistance, capacitance, and an iron core inductance it is shown that the abrupt rise in current at a certain critical voltage is characterized by resonance in the sense that L di/dt = - 1/c ∫ i d t. In this non-linear resonance however the above condition is satisfied in but a limited portion of the cycle. During this portion of the cycle the peak current may be calculated from Ohm's law. The series circuit with linear resistance, capacitance, and an iron core reactor with superimposed steady magnetizing force, is shown to exhibit a pulsation oscillation which is explained on the basis of the positive impedance-current characteristic of such reactors. Parallel resonance for the non-linear case of an iron core reactor is reported, and it is shown that in conjunction with series resonance the unique characteristic is obtained wherein the r. m. s. current decreases with increasing applied voltage."
"The decisions of the International Electrotechnical Commission (I. E. C.) at Oslo in July 1930, with respect to international magnetic units and unit names, are briefly reviewed. So far as concerns the c. g. s. magnetic units, the decisions appear likely to meet with general favor; but the series is incomplete and might advantageously be supplemented by at least one name- that for the c. g. s. unit of reluctance. The series of units in the practical or volt-ampere-ohm system is also incomplete; but apparently cannot be completed satisfactorily without first deciding two questions: (a) whether the system should be rationalised and (b) whether the m. k. s. or the c. g. s. s. system should be endorsed. It is recommended that these questions be left for the present undecided, until they have been widely discussed, and illustrative literature developed in aid of international decision."
"A theory of coexisting stationary and rotating slot openings is developed with the aid of ``revolving permeances,'' and the magnitude and speed of the parasitic fluxes due to the slot openings and the fundamental current density wave are found. It is shown that the interaction of the fundamental flux and a parasitic flux of the same order of magnitude as the fundamental flux causes the vibrations, objectionable noises, and crawlings of induction motors. The existence of these ruinous irregularities depends only in the difference of slots, the number of poles, and in some cases on the critical speeds of the rotor for circular or tortional vibrations, and is independent of the number of phases or the type of winding. Three rules are developed for the determination of destructive vibrations and noise, eight rules for establishing crawling speeds, and eight rules for finding hooks in the speed-torque curves of induction motors."
"A synchronous motor started as an induction motor must pass through an electro-mechanical transient after the field circuit is supplied with electrical excitation in order to change its action from that of an induction motor to that of a synchronous motor. The calculation of this problem has been difficult because the differential equation of motion is of a non-linear type of which no analytical solution has been made. The integraph at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has given a new and direct method of solving equations of the type encountered in these pulling-into-step transients. In this paper are compiled the results of many integraph solutions which were made after combining the factors that influence the performance of such machines into ratios and relative factors so that the results will apply to all practical cases. From the solutions several generalizations are made which can be directly applied to determine whether or not any type of salient-pole synchronous motor will synchronize properly. These solutions take into account inertia, saliency, incompleteness of amortisseur windings, load, switching angle, and field current, and assume negligible armature resistance, negligible rotor leakage reactance, no saturation, constant load torque near synchronous speed, and negligible electrical transients. Oscillograph tests of a 160-hp. motor and a sample calculation are given."
"The present paper represents an attempt at a reasonably complete solution of the heat flow in large turbine generators, where the temperature drops through the various iron paths are of consequence. The solution of two-dimensional problems of heat flow is obtained by means of ``equivalent thermal circuits.'' The approximations involved in this method are discussed in two appendixes where exact solutions are developed. The theory has been applied to a number of large turbine generators with satisfactory agreement between measured and calculated temperatures. The application of the results to actual machines will be made the subject of a subsequent paper."
"Transient voltage phenomena within auto-transformers differ from those in transformers, because in the former there are two points of the winding connected to independent transmission lines. This allows independent variation of the potential of these points. When a surge comes to an auto-transformer from one line only, the other line acts practically as a ``solid ground'' for internal oscillations of the windings, provided it is long enough. Transient voltage stresses between turns and between coils, therefore, are higher in auto-transformers than in transformers of the same voltage rating. The non-resonating auto-transformer has been developed for commercial use. In mechanical construction it is essentially the same as the non-resonating transformer. The presence of two independent lines connected to an autotransformer permits several conditions of surge excitation. This allows corresponding variations in the design of shields."
"The usual vacuum tube harmonic generators are fundamentally high distortion amplifiers operated under conditions of grid bias and plate voltage which, to distort the input voltage wave, utilize the non-linear relation between plate voltage and plate current. This paper gives the result of an investigation into the possibilities of using the non-linear grid voltage-current characteristic to produce harmonics. Grid distortion can be utilized by operating the tube so that the grid goes positive for a part of each fundamental frequency cycle and then inserting in series with the grid lead an impedance across which the grid current impulses produce a voltage drop rich in harmonics, which is then amplified in the plate circuit. The grid circuit distortion harmonic generator has the advantages of producing the harmonic in one circuit and developing the power in another, combined with the very high distortion properties of the grid circuit. The result is that the grid-distortion harmonic generator develops from 100 to over 1,000 times as much power on the higher harmonics as does the usual plate dist rtion generator. Thus, when using a suitable parallel resonant circuit as the distorting grid impedance, a steady output of 135 volts effective has been obtained on the 22nd harmonic from a radio receiving tube. When the grid impedance consists of a large inductance it is possible to generate simultaneously at least 1/20th milliwatts of power on every harmonic up to the 50th."

"This paper describes tests made to determine the characteristics of the clearance of faults in several types of a-c. low-voltage network copper-conductor cables installed in accordance with present standards of underground construction, and includes a discussion of test results together with other relative data studied. The investigation included the burning clear of various types of faults in buried non-magnetic sheath cables, and non-metallic sheath and lead-covered cables for duct installation. A comparison is made of the burn-off characteristics of the several cable constructions and their installations. The amount of short-circuit current and length of time required to clear the different types of faults in No. 4/0, 350,000-and 500,000-cir. mil cables have been determined by test and by calculations in some instances. Conclusive data were not obtained to clear up all present conflicting opinions related to the burn-off characteristics of a-c. low-voltage network cables. However, a study of the subject matter would seem to establish at least a partial basis in regard to burn-off characteristics for determining the conductor size of low-voltage network mains and the spacing of network transformers. Desirable developments for a-c. network cables indicated by the results of this investigation are emphasized."
"The extinction of a-c. arcs at current zero is reviewed, and arc reignition characteristic and circuit reignition characteristic are defined. From a study of arc reignition characteristics of short arcs remote from insulation it is concluded that such arcs are incapable of interrupting practical low-voltage a-c. network circuits. The extinction of arcs in practical network cables is then ascribed to the deionizing action of gas blasts coming from decomposing adjacent insulation. Experiments with arcs in cables, and arcs between parallel plates remote from insulation, and closely bounded by insulation, confirm this view. Inorganic insulating materials may also assist in arc extinction by generating gas blasts by their decomposition. Of the various inorganic materials tried, boric acid was the most effective. Charring of organic insulation may be expected to cause it to lose its arc extinction aiding characteristic."
"Developments made in circuit breakers in the last two years have emphasized the necessity for obtaining experimental evidence of the current-voltage-time relationships that exist during the period when the a-c. arc between metallic electrodes passes through its cyclic current zero. Twenty-nine cathode-ray oscillograms of these relationships are presented. During the current zero period the arc electrode voltage is determined by the circuit constants and rises until the electrode voltage reaches the breakdown or reignition value, which is determined by the deionizing influences at work while the arc is extinguished. Alteration of the circuit constants permits a variation in the rate of voltage rise with a consequent change in the reignition voltage. Permanent extinguishment of the arc occurs when the gap breakdown voltage has risen, due to deionizing influences, to a value that cannot be reached by the electrode voltage controlled by circuit constants. The action of a circuit breaker in extinguishing an arc is greatly influenced by the presence of adjacent load circuits and by the presence of distributed inductance and capacity in the connecting lines."
"The primary network is similar to the low-voltage network in so far as the interconnection of the secondary mains is concerned. Two transformation steps are required in the primary network described here, and only one in the low-voltage network. Nevertheless, the primary network has economic possibilities which should be considered for areas of medium load density. A preliminary study of the so-called primary network indicated that the principle had possibilities worthy of exploitation. It was, therefore, decided that such a network would be installed if at all feasible to obtain operating experience with the system. The design work for this initial installation is complete and construction work has started. It is recognized that there is a number of problems to be worked out more thoroughly. As experience in operation is obtained, and with intensive study of the requirements it is expected that improvements will be made and the designs materially simplified. Even with the limitations existing at the time of writing it appears that the primary network offers important advantages over the radial system for certain types of load."
"The object of this paper is to outline the engineering plan of the low-voltage a-c. network system in Philadelphia, Pa. and to summarize operating experience over a five-year period. The development of this system and the operating experience will be of interest, since several basic features, which contribute toward the successful results, are different from the basic plan in other types of network systems. The system consists of sectionalized primary loop feeders, supplying a fused secondary network. At present there are twenty-four feeders in operation, with a total normal operating capacity of 32,540 kva.; the coincident feeder peak to date being 27,600 kva. The conclusions in the paper are essentially as follows: 1. The system plan initially adopted has been followed without fundamental change, and has proven amply flexible to meet changed load conditions as the area develops. 2. Operating experience has been very satisfactory, under all conditions, including those at time of faults on the network or else-where on the system."
"In this paper there is presented an analysis of the circuit consisting of any number of line conductors in parallel with a return through the earth and any number of ground wires in parallel. In the development of this analysis certain assumptions have been made which tests indicate do not detract at all from the engineering usefulness of the result but which simplify the formulas very much. The general formulas resulting from this analysis are condensed in Table A-1. For the application of this method to the calculation of ground faults it is necessary to know what value of earth conductivity applies. Considerable data in regard to this for various localities have been collected and are given in Table C-2. For convenience in makihg the calculations curves are given for various values of the earth conductivity over the range as indicated by test and experience. These curves are given as Figs. C-2 and C-3. Occasionally preliminary calculations are made in which very approximate reactance valutes are used. In such cases a line reactance of 0.8 ohms per mi. is used, and a zero phase sequence reactance of 2.6 ohms per mi. could be used with the same degree of accuracy. With one ground wire the zero phase sequence reactance would be about 2.0 ohms per mi. and with two ground wires about 1.6 ohms per mi."
"The method of symmetrical components now so extensively used to determine short-circuit currents and stability limits during transient conditions for three-phase transmission systems when a fault involving one or more of the three conductors occurs at any one point of the system, has been extended to apply to three-phase systems during simultaneous faults at two or more points of the system. A general equivalent circuit is developed to replace, in the positive phase diagram, two simultaneous faults involving any combination of the six conductors. An approximate equivalent circuit to be used with the d-c. calculating table when resistance is neglected is also given. Special equivalent circuits are employed to rep, lace two simultaneous faults and the lines upon which they occur, when the lines are unloaded feeders radiating from a common point or lines of equal impedances bussed at both ends. The methods and formulas given in this paper were developed in answer to such questions as the following: 1. Which is a more severe shock to a system, a double line-to-ground fault on one circuit or two single line-to-ground faults occurring simultaneously on two separate circuits? 2. Do simultaneous double line-to-ground faults which involve the same phases, a and b, on two circuits, result in more or less ground current than faults which involve phases a and b on one cir-cuit and phases b and c on the other?"
"The nature of power requirements for telephone offices is discussed, with emphasis on continuity of service. Automatic controls are indicated because of their more exact performance, with consequent reduction in variations and in interruptions and their saving in maintenance, particularly with 24-hour operation demanded. Developments are traced, showing an increasing trend toward automatic regulation and control of main power supplies, ringing and other signaling energy sources. The development of ``unit type power plants'' for telephone offices is discussed and information is given on a number of standardized plants which operate upon a full automatic or a semi-automatic basis. These furnish power supply for manual, toll, and telegraph central offices, for magneto offices and for manual and dial system private branch exchanges also for small dial system central offices. Favorable operating experience points the way toward further introduction of automatic devices which will place most telephone power plants, except those in the larger dial system offices, in a position to operate themselves over considerable intervals of time."
"This paper mentions some of the early methods of providing electrical energy to operate telegraph circuits and contrasts these with a description of the telegraph power plant in the Western Union Telegraph Company's new building in New York City. It also describes the present general methods of distributing power to telegraph circuits and the equipment recently designed for maintaining continuity of power including engine generator sets for standby service."
"Considerable need has been felt for accurate methods of soluttion of the problem of temperature rise under variable loading in order that the maximum use may be made of the large investment in power cables. In this paper a rigorous solution of the problem of temperature rise from sheath surface to conductor is attempted, making use of Bessel functions. The heat flow cycle is resolved into harmonics, and each harmonic solved separately for temperature at the conductor. The various harmonics of temperature are then combined in their proper phase relation to obtain the temperature cycle. For purposes of assigning emergency ratings a solution is arrived at for suddenly applied steady loads, making use of the Fourier integral. The problem is solved rigorously for single-conductor cables and three-conductor cables of shielded (type ``H'') construction. Modifications of the constants of the cables are described which will allow the theory to be applied to cables of standard belted construction with reasonable accuracy. The probable errors involved in the assumptions necessary in the solution are discussed. It is believed that knowing the temperature of the air at the sheath surface, the temperature of the conductor can be calculated within 4 or 5 per cent of the correct value if the constants of the cable are known within this accuracy. The method can also be applied to solution of the temperature rise of the sheath surface provided the constants of the duct bank are known with sufficient accuracy."
"The electrical characteristics of the lead sheaths of underground cables can be calculated by the methods used for computing proximity effect. Theoretically, any group of round wires and thin tubes can be calculated. Cases which are taken up in this paper are (1) a thin tube and an enclosed wire, (2) the current density, voltage drop, and power loss in the sheath of a three-conductor cable, (3) two single-conductor cables with the sheaths open-circuited, (4) two single-conductor cables with the sheaths short-circuited, and (5) three single-conductor cables in a plane."
"This paper developes the mathematical formulas and discusses the assumption involved in the methods for determining the losses of transformers for use with mercury arc rectifiers. The methods discussed have been proposed for the A. I. E. E. Standards. From test readings of current taken under service conditions, a rigid calculation of copper losses is made. From this calcutlation it is shown that the proposed methods give values that are accurate within satisfactory limits. The paper also presents the advantages of the proposed methods for determining the losses of transformers for use with mercury arc rectifiers."
"The purpose of the paper is to correlate the work which has been done on thermal breakdown and to put it in a form in which it can be used by the electrical engineer in the calculation of breakdown voltage. Besides a treatment of the Fock theory, the paper includes the derivation of new formulas for breakdown of very thin and very thick samples and for internal temperature rise and current. A startling fact brought out by this analysis is that before breakdown the internal temperature never rises more than about 10 deg. cent. above ambient temperature. The Fock tables of breakdown voltage are extended to cover a wider range of temperature and thickness, and the results are put in several convenient forms for numerical calculation. Experimental data are also presented to verify the theory."
"Three electrical circuits which are separate and independent of each other, except that they are magnetically coupled by lines of force which interlink with the conductors in each circuit, can be represented by an equivalent circuit which has been developed from well-known fundamental equations. There are two distinct types of the three-circuit transformer which depend upon the relative directions of the fluxes flowing in the mutual paths in the magnetic circuit. Any arrangement of three coupled circuits will have the characteristics of either one type or the other. It is therefore important to study the magnetic circuits to determine the paths for the flux which interlink with the conductors in each of the electrical circuits. There are stray fluxes which interlink with the conductors in only one circuit and mutual fluxes which interlink with the conductors in two circuits. It may also be that there are mutual fluxes that interlink with the conductors in all three circuits. A problem of each type of transformer has been considered. In Case I the coils in each circuit, or the cores on which they are mounted, are disposed parallel to each other or arranged in the form of a Y in which case it is practically impossible to have a mutual flux thread through all three coils."
"This paper describes a visual indicating meter for the measurement of noise and other sounds. Its design is based on the known characteristics of sound and hearing, which are summarized. Particular attention has been paid to the response of the meter to sounds of short duration The aim has been to make the meter both simple in operation and portable. An attachment for the frequency analysis of noise is under development. Several fields of use of the meter and analyzer are indicated."
"The audio noise meter described in this paper is a portable instrument for measuring and analyzing noise and vibration of machinery. The analyzer obtains its high selectivity through the use of a mechanical ``band pass filter'' of four stages. Some test results and a discussion of the measurement problem are given."
"Magnetic noise in synchronous machines is shown to be of two principal kinds. One is a vibration in the tooth frequency range which usually occurs whether load is present or not; the other has twice line frequency and is dependent on load current. The vibrating part of the structure is usually the stator but may be the rotor and in nearly all cases of troublesome noise mechanical resonance is present. Some measurements of vibration on noisy machines are given."
"This paper describes the mechanics of the development of a lightning stroke in a cloud and the formation of a surge on a line. It shows that the energy of a stroke can vary between wide limits so that the actual surge on the line may be of practically any magnitude. Fundamental types of high-tension line construction are analyzed to show the performance that would be obtained with them. Experience obtained on the 220-kv. lines of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company is offered to substantiate the belief that induced surges are of relatively small importance and that the direct stroke is the criterion for good design. The effects of line construction on the character of surges impressed on the terminal substation apparatus is discussed to indicate the degree of protection that would be required."
"This paper describes the 1930 results (fifth consecutive year) of a lightning investigation conducted on 220-kv. lines located in eastern Pennsylvania and where lightning storms are prevalent. During 1930 the investigation was expanded; two new devices, the surge (insulator assembly flashover) indicator and the lightning (storm) severity meter being successfully applied. Unique and comprehensive data were secured on the magnitudes and wave shapes of natural lightning surges both at and remote from the point of origin on the transmission line; numbers of phases faulted during trip-outs; numbers, magnitudes and effects of direct lightning strokes; some data on the relative importance of induced strokes; results of measurements of atmospheric voltage gradients; and the indicated effect of overhead ground wires and tower footing resistances."
"A discussion is given of cathode-ray oscillograms showing the attenuation and distortion of artificial lightning surges on a power transmission line, the voltages induced by such surges in parallel wires and the effect on tower footing impedance of earth wires or counterpoises."
"The results of a five years' investigation of the effects of lightning on transmission systems are reviewed. It is concluded that direct strokes play a prominent part in causing flashover. Induced strokes are also important. Conventional overhead ground wires with low tower footing resistance take care of direct strokes, as well as induced strokes, and prevent flashover. The mechanism of the lightning stroke is not yet understood, but the indications are that polarity effects are highly important and must be given full consideration."
"When the mathematical solution of a problem is so difficult as to be impracticable it sometimes is possible to obtain the desired answer from the behavior of an analogous electric circuit. This article presents an analog of ``coulomb friction,'' and demonstrates the application of this analog to the previously unsolved problem of the torsional-vibration damper."

"This paper describes the communication facilities in use on the Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi Power & Light Companies' interconnected system, and describes the operating performance of the communication equipment. Carrier-current telephone equipment is used to a large extent for relatively long distance communication, the longest distance being 459 miles. The reliability of this means of communication under unusual storm conditions is discussed. The experience resulting from over six years use of carrier-current telephony for load dispatching purposes is described."

"The paper describes operating tests with large turbo generators under load and gives a résumé of answers to a questionnaire, bearing on the phenomena accompanying the interruption of the direct-current excitation supply, followed by reclosing after a short interval. The object of the investigation was to determine, if possible, a reasonably safe operating procedure that could be followed in reestablishing normal conditions on a large turbo generator whose excitation had been interrupted while carrying load. The authors conclude that the reexcitation of a generator without withdrawing it from the bus is a justifiable and safe operating procedure and the one that will restore all conditions to normal in the shortest time. These conclusions have been verified by twelve prearranged tests, five ``experiences'' in the local company and seventeen ``experiences'' by other companies. In all of these cases the field switches have been reclosed without trouble of any kind."
"Recent advances in the theory of synchronous machines have introduced a large number of new constants. The method of symmetrical components requires sequence reactances, and an accurate theory of transients requires transient and subtransient reactances and time constants. Most of the published discussion on the constants has been concerned with the application, rather than the calculation of values. In this paper, all of the most significant constants are calculated, except the subtransient time constant. A general method of calculation is discussed in which the reactances are accurately resolved into components. Comparisons of test and calculated values are given. The formulas for salient-pole machines and turbine generators are given in Appendixes A and B. The principle of superposition is applied to resolve accurately the reactances into components which can be readily calculated. The induced currents in the field and additional damping circuits are accounted for simply by applying the constant interlinkage theorem."
"This paper is essentially a mathematical study of transient voltages in transformer and other distributed windings, and is primarily concerned with showing the effects of wave shape, circuit constants and neutral impedances on the voltage distributions, and how these distributions may be controlled or changed. In the appendix there is derived the general differential equation for a circuit consisting of distributed self and mutual inductance, series and shunt capacitance, series resistance, and conductance along the stack and to ground. This equation is solved for the following conditions: (1) initial and final conditions with generalized impedance in the neutral; (2) grounded neutral; (3) isolated neutral for zero losses; and (4) capacitance in the neutral when the losses and mutual inductance are neglected. Equations are given corresponding to a number of different applied waves, showing the effects of wavelength, wave front, damped and sustained oscillations, and typical lightning waves, and these effects are illustrated by curves and oscillograms. Equations are also given for the potential difference between any two points on the winding and for the voltage gradients. Tables are included showing the influence of the various circuit constants on the amplitude and frequency of oscillation, linear velocity and surge impedance of harmonic waves, and the type of propagation. These effects are illustrated by curves of the potential distribution at different instants of time. Methods of controlling the transient so as to prevent or alleviate abnormal voltage distributions are discussed at length."
"The complete mathematical solution of applying suddenly a d-c. voltage to an electromagnetic circuit composed of an electric coil with a partly laminated and partly solid iron core containing an air-gap is presented in this paper. Starting from Maxwell's field equations for the eddy currents and the magnetic field in the iron core, the solution of the time conditions is reached with the aid of Heaviside's operational calculus. The result is expressed by means of a time constant of the magnetic field, composed of the time constant of the electric circuit and a fraction of a new-defined time constant of the solid iron part due to the eddy currents in that part. The importance of this result is illustrated by its application to a numerical example and to the effectiveness of quick response excitation in the case of large synchronous generators. Finally some other important applications are discussed."
"The services rendered by an interconnection between two or more electric power systems may be classified as: 1. Emergency service-by which assistance is given by one system to the other in event of breakdown of equipment or other abnormal conditions. 2. Load diversity-arising from the non-coincidence of the times of peak loads in the interconnected systems. 3. Firm power-transactions involving a definite advance commitment by one company to sell power and energy to the other for use in lieu of installed capacity. 4. Storage power-by which off-peak energy from one system is converted into peak capacity in the other through the medium of storage. 5. Intra-company use-referring to the use of interconnecting facilities for the internal purposes of one of the parties. 6. Economy flow-by which generation in one system is replaced by more economical generation in the other system; and 7. Unintentional flow. The foregoing services may be evaluated, as far as capital cost is concerned, by determining the aggregate saving in generating capacity and multiplying by the estimated cost per kilowatt of generating capacity and then comparing the result with the capital cost of the interconnection. The more important annual-cost comparison is made by: 1. Determining the difference between the fixed charges on the avoided generating station investment and the fixed charges, including operation and maintenance, on the interconnecting facilities. 2. Determining the saving in fixed element of production expense arising from the avoided capacity. 3."
"The geographical characteristics and the early market large quantities of surplus steam capacity, and method of development of the New England region still later some firm power has been sold through the tie. make it a natural field for interconnection. The The South Street steam plant in Providence was next total area covered is small compared with that of other connected with 20,000 kva. of cable capacity. "
"This paper describes a specific interconnected system wherein ten independent operating companies of western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland operate normally in parallel to secure the manifold advantages of the interconnection of their facilities. Some of the benefits derived from the interconnection of these ten companies and the principles and methods followed in actual operation including very brief descriptions of physical plant are treated. The feasibility of coordinating the operations of an interconnected system through a working operating committee functioning in part through the joint dispatching organization of two of the companies without sacrificing independence of operation, is discussed."
"The possibilities of interconnection can only be realized when the system is effectively developed and operated. The interconnected system functions as a unit but the companies owning the different parts have diverse interests which must be sufficiently coordinated both in development and operation to make the benefits of the interconnection available to all the participants. There is question as to how much coordination is sufficient. The differences which exist between an interconnected system and a similar system under one ownership result either from the larger size of the interconnected system or from the variations in interests of the ownerships involved. Interconnection development usually tends to reduce generation costs while increasing transmission costs and hazards. Possibly there are some limits to the size of the interconnected system and the degree of coordination desirable between ownerships. Closed loop operation involving several companies requires attention. Interconnections may be operated by centralized direction or by cooperative methods between adjoining system operators. The unit characteristics of the system require some coordination of the group as a whole. Operation should be simplified as far as possible with adequate operating facilities."
"The paper outlines the communication requirements of electric utilities and suggests effective methods for meeting those requirements. Operating, customer service, and administrative activities are considered separately. However, the advantages of a unified communication system for all activities are outlined. The relative merits of cable, open wire, power line carrier and radio are reviewed. The use of communication channels for telemetering and supervisory control purposes is discussed. The desirability of basic plans for establishing and operating communication systems for electric utilities is discussed in detail."
"This paper discusses potentiometer design under the following headings: I. Early history. II. Factors affecting voltage range. III. Factore affecting potentiometer resistance. IV. Low-voltage potentiometers. V. Analysis of potentiometer errors. VI. Self-checking features of potentiometers. VII. Galvanometer considerations. VIII. Comments on volt-boxes. IX. Deflection potentiometers. X. The potentiometer in industry. No attempt has been made to give the complete history of potentiometer development, as the paper is not intended to be primarly historical. Neither has any attempt been made to include all of the circuits which have been used in high-resistance potentiometers and in the earlier forms of low-resistance potentiometers, as this would require too much time and space. Material of this kind has been limited to the minimum amount necessary to establish the proper background for the discussion of the subject."
"In 1923 an amendment to the International Convention of 1875 relating to weights and measures gave the International Committee of Weights and Measures authority to deal with the electrical units. This committee was thereby confronted with two major problems concerning the magnitudes of the units and the best procedure for their legalization and maintenance. It set up an Advisory Committee of experts to advise it on all such questions. At its second meeting, in 1930, the Advisory Committee adopted a resolution to the effect that further comparisons of the manganin wire standards of resistance with mercury ohms are unnecessary. The mercury ohm has so long been the legalized material standard of resistance that it is regarded by many workers as a permanent institution, subject only to such slight revision of the length and mass of the mercury column as might be shown to be necessary as the technique of absolute measurements becomes more accurate. The present paper first gives a background by outlining the entire history of the unit of electrical resistance."
"In recent years there have been many advancements made in the art of analysis of three-phase synchronous machine operation. Most treatments to date have very properly stressed the theoretical point of view, the practical point of view receiving less attention due in part to the complications involved, particularly those due to saturation effects. In this paper the practical stand-point is stressed and discussed on the basis of observations made from many tests; an important feature of these tests is that saturation effects under short circuit were studied by applying short circuits to machines operating at rated voltage. Due to serious saturation effects, the so-called constants of synchronous machines may have different values under different conditions. What are considered to be the most important of these values are discussed, and by defining certain saturated and other values, an attempt is made to provide a definite basis for the specification of machine constants. Part I reviews certain basic concepts and discusses practical considerations of test methods. Part II describes methods of determining the more important constants by test. Part III illustrates the application of these methods to actual power machinery, and presents tabulated test results as well as a table of typical constants. The Appendixes are devoted to certain additional tests and conclusions, and to development of formulas."
"The only proper way to test automatic and supervisory control equipment is to submit it to actual service conditions over a period of time. Since no one operating company can possibly serve as a proving ground for all types of automatic and supervisory equipment under all service conditions, the alternative is the interchange of operating experiences and ideas between the several companies using this equipment. The Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation has had automatic and semi-automatic stations of various types in operation during the last ten years. It is found that the class of service secured from any type of automatic station is directly dependent upon the excellence of inspection and maintenance. The chief items of trouble experienced in these automatic stations listed in the order of frequency of their occurrence are: graphic meter pens and clocks, circuit breaker auxiliary switches and closing mechanisms, grounds on control circuits, and relays due to obsolescence and loss of adjustment. The Toronto Hydro-Electric System has long realized the advantages and economies of automatic and supervisory control. As a result, all new stations built since 1920 have been designed for either automatic or supervisory control. The present policy is to design the railway converter stations for automatic control and the distribution stations for supervisory control. The automatic controls have given fairly satisfactory results and the supervisory controls have given excellent results, especially the cable type supervisory. The chief source of trouble experienced with all this equipment has been relay failures."
"The 182-kv. oil-filled cable placed in service in Chicago in 1927 was designed by the manufacturers in 1925 to have the largest carrying capacity commercially feasible for that voltage in the state of the art as it then existed. During the succeeding years the advancement in the art was so rapid that the cable for the same voltage installed in 1930 had a carrying capacity 75 per cent greater and a cost 20 per cent less than the 1927 line. Improved oil, new designs of oil supply tanks and methods of shipping and connecting cable had reduced the cost of installation and the design of the terminals. Successful operating experience with devices and methods for eliminating sheath losses had removed the previous limitation on the economical size of the conductor. Operating data and test results indicated that the insulation on the first line was thicker than necessary and this led to an inquiry regarding the economy of using the oil-filled type of insulation at higher and lower voltages. Other questions concerned with future developments in the Chicago region indicated the necessity of a careful study of all recent advances in the art, and resulted in extending the investigations so as to include an economic study of transmission cable for all voltages, present and prospective."
"This paper deals briefly with the general theory and some of the outstanding characteristics of oil-filled cable practise. Oil-filled cable has had a perfect operating record during the past four years and during this time many simplifications and economies have been introduced. Further gains in this direction are indicated. Today, this type of cable is well in line with ordinary paper-insulated cable from an economic standpoint. The limiting features of oil demand and oil supply are explained and typical methods of oil feed with expansible reservoirs described. Space does not allow the inclusion of many additional things of interest such as a description and drawings of the complete line of cable and accessories that have been developed."
"The purpose of the paper is to describe a method of analysis for taking into account the effect of insulation variability in the determination of breakdown voltages and allowable operating stresses. The method is applicable to systems containing large areas of insulation, or large numbers of units of insulation in parallel. General equations are derived, giving the breakdown voltage and number of failures to be expected, in terms of two parameters; the mean breakdown voltage and the variability of the insulation, both of which are determined from tests made on samples. It is shown how the results may be applied to the special case of electric power cables, for comparing the relative merits of different cables, and for determining the safety factor required to take account of the inherent variability and consequent unreliability of the insulation. The necessity of considering the variability as well as the so-called strength of insulation is emphasized, and its importance brought out in terms of allowable operating stresses and failures. A graphical method of analysis is described, which makes use of probability paper, changing the probability scale from ``per cent'' to ``failures per hundred miles per year'' in the case of cables. Predictions of theory are compared with the results of practise, using results from experiments made to determine the effect of electrode area on breakdown voltage. Good agreement is shown between the two."
"This paper presents the results of a study made with short, stationary a-c. arcs between metallic electrodes, in order to determine the effect of arc length, electrode material, and current magnitude on the rate of recovery of dielectric strength of the arc space following a current zero. The experimental results show (1) that the arc space recovers the ability to withstand a hundred volts or more within a few microseconds after a current zero, as predicted by Slepian's theory, (2) that the maximum allowable rate of rise of voltage across the arc space which will just permit arc extinction is much greater for very short arcs (1 cm. or less) than for longer arcs, (3) that the critical rate of rise of voltage depends largely on the electrode material used and tends to vary as a decreasing linear function of the boiling point, and (4) that the higher current arcs have a much lower critical rate of rise of voltage than the lower current arcs."
"A circuit is described whereby a corona tube may be used to regulate the output of a full-wave rectifier and therefore to control the excitation of a generator to give constant voltage. Performance curves are given for a five-kva. generator whose voltage is controlled by such a regulator."
"Qualitative results of an investigation, in which high-voltage impulses were applied to an energized transmission line, indicate that the probability of a lightning flashover developing into a power arc is increased when current is flowing past the flashover point, and when the normal frequency voltage is increased or the insulation decreased. An oscillographic study of power arcs ranging in magnitude from 8 to 800 amperes indicated that the resistance of an arc varies over the cycle and over the duration of the arc. The effective arc resistance is approximated by the ratio of the peak voltage to the peak current. The apparent power factor of the arc current and voltage is practically unity in most cases. The tests indicated that arcs formed in a capacitive circuit are more persistent than those in inductive or resistive circuits, and that the average peak volts per foot of arc length, for currents above 100 amperes peak, is about 300. The maximum overvoltage recorded on an isolated neutral 75-kv. transmission system, 134 miles in length, as a result of 63 arcing ground tests was 3.0 times normal on a sound phase. The overvoltage is essentially a fundamental frequency phenomenon in which the sound phase voltage takes its new value without going through an oscillation of appreciable magnitude."

"California's latest hydroelectric development activities are centered in the Mokelumne River property of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. This project involves the complete redevelopment of the river, from water surveys to power distribution, and will make available a billion kilowatt-hours annually, ten times the output of a 1902 development on the same stream."
"To carry 150,000 kw. of hydroelectric energy from the mountains of California to the San Francisco Bay area and there distribute it, required the construction of an entirely new 220-kv. transmission system and the development of a one-time 60-kv. substation into a major system switching center interconnecting 60-, 110-, and 220-kv. lines."
"THIS newest steam station of the Duke Power Company, Charlotte, N. C., was placed in operation in October 1929 with an initial capacity of 137,500 kva., about one-fourth of the expected ultimate. Each of the two generating units operates at 1,800 r. p. m. with steam at 425 lb. gage and 725 deg. fahr., delivering energy at 13 kv. Each of the four cross-drum boilers has 35,500 sq. ft. of heating surface and is designed for 500-lb. working pressure; maximum furnace heat liberation is 30,000 B. t. u. per hr. per cu. ft. of volume. Pulverized coal is burned; the supply being received by rail. With this station the steam-electric capacity of the Duke system passed the 50-per cent point."
"In an older day those who failed to store their food at harvest time did not fare so well during the winter; now, those who fail to accumulate at least a moderate surplus during times of plenty suffer accordingly during the cyclic “depressions.” A thoughtful industrial leader, himself once a farm boy, here makes some interesting comparisons."
"STABILITY of power transmission “between two power plants operating in parallel is of utmost importance in providing uninterrupted power supply during system disturbances and abnormal operating conditions which may be due to short circuits, switching, and a variety of other causes,” states Alexander Smouroff (F'24) professor, Electrotechnical Institute, Leningrad, U. S. S. R., in introducing a recent manuscript dealing with the subject of static stability. This paper represents another mathematical contribution to the analytical solution of the transmission stability problem and, being written by a prominent foreign engineer, represents a point of view somewhat different from that of American engineers."
"The problem of properly loading generating stations has evinced a gradual but continuous advancement as knowledge of the characteristics of power station equipment increased and methods of interpreting these progressed. The increment method has proved to be the most economical scheme thus far introduced."
"Some of the features involved in the problem of “establishing a high professional standing of engineers in public affairs” are discussed here. Establishment of state and local engineering councils, and some means of “certification” of engineers by national professional societies are mentioned as steps toward a possible solution."
"As a possible method of increasing the transient stability limits of a long transmission system the author discusses the effects of inserting series resistances into the generator circuits to load the machines during fault conditions and thus retard subsequent overswings."
"A method is outlined whereby the vertical and horizontal projections of contact-wire hangers are computed separately and the hanger lengths in turn obtained from these. The method postulates a smooth horizontal curve of contact wire, and can be used for both regular and irregular curves."
"Design and construction details involved in the electrification of 59 track miles in connection with a major union terminal development are outlined."
"Completion of the longest telephone toll cable west of the Mississippi gives San Francisco and Los Angeles a 275-circuit all-cable communication channel, the equivalent of three of the latest-type 60-wire open leads completely equipped with carrier systems. The project cost ten million dollars, involved some heavy construction problems, and provided an important step toward an ultimate all-cable transcontinental system."
"The second article in The Engineering Foundation's symposium “Has Man Benefited by Engineering Progress?” presented here predicts further industrial decentralization as a result of the wide availability of electric power."
"FASTER telegraphic communication is expected in this day of increasing speed of transportation; and speed must be accomplished with accuracy and the highest degree of service continuity. In order to meet these service demands electrically-operated devices in great variety, including belt-type message conveyer and pneumatic tubes in the larger offices, are finding their way into telegraphic service in ever-increasing quantities. Thus it is that the power plant is more than ever the heart of the system and every means must be provided to maintain an absolutely unfailing supply of electric energy."
"Tests show conclusively that the new highspeed oil-blast circuit breaker will clear the most severe faults within eight cycles or less, and from a system operating standpoint this type of breaker is reported as being definitely superior to other types. A careful analysis of the results shows further cause for the adoption of the multi-duty cycle. This and the two articles on the following pages outline the test procedure and discuss the conclusions reached."
"SYSTEM DISTURBANCES due to the tests were not serious and caused but little trouble and but few complaints except from consumers at points nearby. Recording voltmeters were installed during the tests at all of the important 132-kv. substations on the system. Typical charts from these recorders are shown in Fig. 4. While inertia and over-travel in a voltmeter of this type are responsible for some of the variations in the charts, nevertheless a clear comparison may be noted between the severity of disturbances caused by high speed and by ordinary circuit breakers. The most striking comparison is revealed by the charts obtained at points close to the Philo plant, such as those taken at Crooksville. Here again the inertia of the moving pen instrument plays a large part in the record obtained, but at the same time a fairly accurate comparison may be drawn. In addition it is felt that a dip, the duration of which is too short for the recording voltmeter pen to follow, may also be too short to cause a synchronous machine to fall out of step."
"PERFORMANCE of different types of breaker contacts, and rates of recovery-voltage rise, are the principal items receiving particular attention in this analysis of the Philo circuit breaker tests. As stated previously the rate of recovery-voltage rise was manipulated by varying the number of lines connected to the Philo station bus."
"MANY great poets of China repeatedly have described the beauty of Hangchow. It is the capital of the Province of Chekiang, one of the smallest but richest in the country. At one time its leading glory was the fame of its beautiful landscape, but the town now is winning a standing also through the increasing application of modern engineering. Among several developments the most recent and perhaps most important is the new automatic telephone exchange system which now serves the whole area."
"With 91 per cent of the world's telephones already provided with facilities for direct international conversations, plans and developments are progressing to provide extensions. Present services are outlined here and some data given covering the Hawaiian link now under construction."
"TRANSMITTING, recording, reproducing, and amplifying of sound by mechanical, electrical, and photographic devices have brought an industrial need for an exact science of sound. In 10 years of research with modern instruments and laboratory methods, and with the latest knowledge of physiology, enough has been learned to establish principles for training a voice understandingly although much additional research is needed."
"INTERPRETIVE abstracts of all papers presented at the Pacific Coast A. I. E. E. convention (August 25–28, 1931) are presented herewith, only excepting those papers already published in this or preceding issues of Electrical Engineering. Members vitally interested and wishing to obtain immediately pamphlet copies of any of these papers are requested to use the order form appearing on p. 770 of this issue. In response to popular demand and within its space limitations Electrical Engineering subsequently may publish certain of these papers, or technical articles based upon them."
"THIS paper deals with electric power in those industries in the Pacific Northwest which use forest wood as raw material for manufacture. It covers briefly the electric power requirements of these industries, and presents some statistics as to electric power consumption. During the past two decades the electric energy consumed in t he lumber, pulp, and paper industries of this district has grown to a value comparable to the total amount generated by all of the central stations operating within the same geographic area."
"IN THE application of electricity to the work of drilling for oil and pumping the wells, many problems peculiar to the oil industry have been encountered. This paper presents some of the more interesting features of these applications, and is confined to a discussion of the duty involved and of the design of the apparatus for the purpose. Although the petroleum industry still relies largely upon engine power, strides have been made during the past ten years in the development and application of electrical apparatus, and in the extension of central station power into oil fields. Oil companies are giving an increasing amount of attention to its use."
"AN ANALYSIS of stator resistance, wire size, horsepower rating, and air-gap density as a function of the flux per pole per unit-length of lamination stacking, stator slot shape and slot insulation, rotor diameter, and flux densities in the stator teeth and core, is given in this paper."
"OPERATING experience with tie-line load regulators on the Pittsburgh, Pa. tie line interconnecting the Colfax Power Station of the Duquesne Light Company with the Springdale station of t he West Penn Power Company is described in this paper. Equipment used, including tie-line load regulators, program load control, and a hydraulic speed changer also is described."
"AN ARTICLE based on this paper was published on pp. 654–657 Electrical Engineering, August 1931. (A. I. E. E. Paper No. 31 M 3)"
"THE ARC is defined as an electrical discharge in a gas or a vapor in which the cathode drop is of the order of 10 or 20 volts and the current density to the cathode spot is of the order of hundreds or thousands of amperes per square centimeter. For an arc to exist it is necessary that there be some mechanism for producing electrons at or near the cathode. Unfortunately, there is no general agreement among physicists as to the mechanism which produces this low cathode drop with the correspondingly high current density which is characteristic of an electric arc. In this paper the author reviews briefly the different prevalent theories regarding the low cathode drop in an arc, offering discussions and interpretations based upon extensive research work carried out at the California Institute of Technology."
"THE MECHANISM of the electric sparkover process lately has become a much discussed problem. Townsend's theory of the formation of electric sparkover has been challenged and at least in some respects found wanting. Several well-known investigators have given ample evidence that the sparkover process is very complex; that the speed of formation is in the order of 108 cm. per sec. instead of 104 or 105; that polarity and shape of electrodes, ionization, space charges, voltage gradients air pressure, temperature, and other factors enter into the problem. The results of investigations on the early stages of electric sparkover throw light on certain phases of the initial or kindling stage of an electric spark formation, but a comprehensive explanation of the mechanism or process involved in the formation of electric sparks or sparkover still is lacking."
"A COMPREHENSIVE description of the apparatus and methods involved in a cooperative precipitation survey and the results obtained are given in this paper. The scope of the paper is limited principally to the watershed area of the eastern Sierra Nevada range of California, the runoff from which constitutes the chief source of water supply for Reno, Nevada, and environs. Statistical information is presented which reveals the accuracy of predictions based on snow surveys, as compared with actual runoff for various seasons. (A. I. E. E. Paper No. 31 M 4)"
"THE AUTHORS' experience with radio-interference problems in northern and central California is used as a basis for this paper. An attempt has been made to present the various phases of the problem rather than to offer a solution of any particular phase. Radio interference from natural static and from radio sources is not within the scope of this paper, but is mentioned where it has a bearing upon interference caused by electrical sources. Natural static is less severe in the West than in the East, making other types of radio interference more apparent. A larger network of higher voltage transmission lines also has been built up in the West because of the extensive hydroelectric developments and a more scattered population, and this factor also enters the problem to some extent."
"THIS paper covers several thermal or calorimeter tests which were made at the Queenston generating station of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, on a 55,000-kva. generator having an enclosed system of ventilation. The objects of the tests were to determine stray-load losses on short circuits and under rated load, and to obtain some information regarding the accuracy of this method of test. Descriptions are given covering the general method followed and the actual tests as made. For those who might wish to check the calculations in detail the actual figures are given in an appendix."

"In this article are presented data obtained during the construction of the tallest building erected to date using the electric arc welding process. The outstanding advantages of this method of construction over the older method of riveting are (1) an almost complete absence of noise, and (2) the reduced steel tonnage required."
"THE OPERATION of determining accurately the amount of moisture present in lumber is reported to be greatly simplified by an electrical apparatus developed by C. G. Suits of the General Electric research laboratory, Schenectady, N. Y., and M. E. Dunlap of the United States Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, Wis."
"The three factors most important in mercury arc rectifiers are vapor pressure, arc-drop, and geometry of the anode housing. Investigations of such factors described in this article, have increased the capacity of rectifiers considerably and made it possible to eliminate several undesirable features of their operation."
"Successful operation of mercury arc rectifiers requires the almost complete elimination of backfires. Studies made to eradicate this evil should recognize that backfires do not occur at some given stress, but are random in their nature. There is, however, an average rate of backfire which determines the reliability of a rectifier."
"Improved methods of calculating and testing the losses in transformers for use with mercury arc rectifiers are now available. These methods greatly simplify the mathematics involved in loss calculations and make it possible to measure directly the losses of transformers independent of the rectifiers."
"Tests on an experimental transmission line show that from the standpoint of damping transient surges there is no advantage in operating the line at so high a voltage that the conductors will be in corona."
"Present day electric power systems, with their complex and far-flung interconnections, cover such large areas that the communication lines serving them have become almost as important as the power lines themselves. In the five articles on this and the following nine pages fundamental requirements of the electric utilities are outlined, and the communication schemes used by four typical operating companies are described."
"EFFECTIVE COORDINATION of the activities of an electric utility necessitates the establishment of communication channels for the continuous flow of information into organization centers, and the prompt transmission of orders and suggestions from these centers to the points where action is taken. Voice communication appears to be especially adapted to meet these requirements, as is evidenced by the fact that about 85 per cent of the average electric utility's communication expense is for transmission of the spoken word."
"THE WESTERN DIVISION of the Niagara Hudson System which serves an area in New York State approximately 250 mi. long and 100 mi. wide has developed a coordinated communication plan including both privately owned and leased lines supplemented by carrier current. In the development of this system, engineers of the New York Telephone Company have worked in cooperation with the power company's operating and executive staffs to develop a flexible, dependable, and adequate communication network."
"A LARGE GROUP of interconnected wholesale and retail electric companies are operated by the New England Power Association in a highly developed industrial area covering parts of five states. Energy is generated at eleven major hydro stations on the Connecticut and Deerfield rivers, whence it is transmitted over a high-voltage network to the load centers in central and eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island; here interconnections are made with several large steam generating plants. To insure maximum economy in operation, a centralized control over all producing and distributing units is necessary."
"COMMUNICATION facilities for the Commonwealth Edison Company system (Chicago) the fixed plant of which is scattered over the entire city, include 19 telephone switchboards, and a total of about 2,600 telephone stations. The main switchboard, together with seven sub-boards, are located in the Edison Building in the downtown section of the city. Of particular interest are the facilities employed in the technical direction and supervision over operating activities."
"CARRIER-CURRENT telephony supplies most of the communication needs for the Arkansas-Louisiana-Mississippi interconnected system comprising a total of approximately 1,800 mi. of 110-kv. lines. Operating supervision for the entire interconnected network is centered in the load-dispatcher's office at the Woodward switching station near Pine Bluff (Ark.) except for the southern portion which is handled from the Jackson (Miss.) office. (See Fig. 8.)"
"Equitable taxes and fair distribution of the cost of government in place of the present unfair indirect bonus system is urged as a vital first step toward cultural progress and public welfare. This is the third article of The Engineering Foundation's symposium “Has Man Benefited by Engineering Progress?”"
"Salient-pole synchronous motors with phase-connected damper windings are capable of developing high starting and pull-in torques with low starting current, as revealed by information given here."
"Details are discussed of a plan which would provide for the regulation of industry through mutual trade associations under federal supervision. Production, consumption, and other factors would be coordinated to reduce cyclic variations; employees would participate jointly in providing unemployment insurance protection and other benefits which would accumulate for the employee regardless of legitimate changes in company or industry affiliations."
"The field of the synchronous motor can be considerably widened by variations in the design of normal motors of this type. Special requirements in starting current and in starting, pull-in, and pull-out torque can be met without resorting to unusual forms of motor design."
"AN INTERESTING SERIES of lightning tests was made on Sunday, August 23, by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company on each of four 42,000-kva., 220-kv. single-phase transformers. These units are of the new non-oscillating surge-proof type of construction recently developed by this company, which states that the transformers embody features of insulation design effecting greatly improved impulse strength."
"The fastest relay scheme for isolating a faulty section of transmission line is the pilot-wire system. This usually requires four wires between stations, and therefore cost limits its application to short sections of line. A modified scheme is described herewith which reduces the number of wires needed."
"Observations were made on all phases of the arc discharge, including the transition period between the glow and arc stages. Current density at the cathode is shown to be the factor determining when that transition will take place, rather than the temperature of that element as was thought formerly."
"The characteristics of single-phase motors are improved considerably by the addition of a capacitor winding on the stator. High torque and low current during starting also can be secured by the use of a repulsion type of rotor."
"THE PLANNING of an electric distribution system for industrial plants may be divided into two distinct parts: (1) determination of the electrical characteristics, and (2) the physical arrangement of the system. Under these two headings W. J. McClain (associated with Louis T. Klauder, consulting engineer, Philadelphia, Pa.) discusses the problem in a very general way in a current A. I. E. E. paper."
"ELECTRON TUBES have been in every-day use in radio and other communication fields for many years. It is only recently, however, that the field of application has been extended to include industrial usages, and while the gross number of industrial installations employing electron tubes is not enormous, important progress has been made in applying these new electrical tools to the problems of industry."

"Experimental studies of arcing faults on a 75-kv. transmission system indicate that a lightning flashover is most likely to develop into a power arc when power current is flowing past the flashover point, when normal-frequency voltage is increased, or when line insulation is decreased."
"Most of the material things which man wishes to do can be done with certainty and repeated with assurance only through the application of scientific information. This is the fourth article of The Engineering Foundation's symposium “Has Man Benefited by Engineering Progress?”"
"When the mathematical solution of a problem is so difficult as to be impracticable it sometimes is possible to obtain the desired answer from the behavior of an analogous electric circuit. This article presents an analog of “coulomb friction,” and demonstrates the application of this analog to the previously unsolved problem of the torsional-vibration damper."
"Power for the two new high-power radio transmitters housed in KDKA's new quarters is obtained from a special 1,500-kva. outdoor substation. Included in the power equipment is a twelve-phase, 900-kw., 30-kv., mercury-cathode tube rectifier, the largest of its type yet built for radio."
"Charts have been prepared which make possible the fairly accurate determination of the resistance and reactance of the earth return circuit. These values, together with the usual line and ground wire self-inductances, may be inserted in a simple formula to determine the positive or zero-phase-sequence impedance of the complete circuit."
"When once constructed, circle diagrams furnish the means by which many phases of transmission-line performance can be checked quite readily. A method is given here by which the center loci are determined for a large number of short-lines where capacitance may be neglected."
"Oil filled cable has been developed for successful use at the highest operating voltages. Attention now is being focused on the economies of oil filled cable systems and on means of simplifying their installation, with a resulting freedom from failure due to mechanical causes. The three articles which follow the short introduction below, discuss these factors."
"Careful studies have been made of the economics of the various types of cables for application in the Chicago district. The conclusions resulting from these studies are surprisingly definite, and indicate the trends in high voltage cable practise, especially as relating to the oil filled type."
"Problems concerned with the supply of oil largely govern the layout of oil filled cable installations. Consideration must be given not only to the characteristics of the oil itself, but also to certain properties of the cable and duct structure governing the volume and pressure of oil required."
"The development of more satisfactory cable joints, terminals, and reservoirs has greatly simplified the installation of oil filled cable and increased the reliability against mechanical failures."
"A native of Russia, speaking the language and familiar with the customs and habits of its people, the author has come to the conclusion that Russia's principal problem in her industrial development is one of management. On the basis of 25 years of professional engineering experience in the U.S.A. and a recent 18-month professional engagement in Russia, this conclusion has been reached."
"SOME of the trends in industrial electrical control as exemplified by recent steel mill installations are indicated in the accompanying illustrations. A seven-panel control desk built for use in connection with a 65-panel switchboard may be seen in the upper illustration. This board although only 98 in. long, and 30 in. high in front, accommodates full control for nine large d-c. motors and five d-c. generators, motor controls including reverse, and fine and coarse speed adjustments."
"Application of parallel capacitance will not correct the power factor of the usual commercial neon tube installation to a value greater than 90 per cent. A constant-current circuit for use with these signs is described in this article, which not only operates at unity power factor but possesses other advantages."
"Records have been kept by three different investigators on various types of automatic equipment for station control. These results are summarized in the following articles."
"AUTOMATIC and semi-automatic stations of various types have been in operation during the past ten years on the system of the Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation. These stations include transformer substations for distribution at both 13,200 and 4,325 volts, street railway and Edison system synchronous converter stations, and synchronous condenser installations."
"THE POLICY of the Toronto Hydro-Electric System is to locate moderate-sized distribution stations near the economical load centers and equip them for automatic or supervisory control. These automatic and supervisory equipments include all the more prominent types as well as equipment developed by the Toronto system for its own use. In addition there is at present a Gamewell signaling system which is used for giving signals to the load dispatchers when switches open automatically in small unattended transformer stations where supervisory control has not been provided."
"EIGHT hydroelectric units, each having a capacity of 13,508 hp., are installed in the Ohio Falls hydroelectric station at Louisville, Ky. Each generating unit is complete in itself. Waterwheel, generator, exciter, governor, electrical control, oil and water supply, oil circuit breakers, etc., are individual to each unit and all related unit auxiliaries are fed entirely from that unit."
"Said to be the most completely equipped hotel ever built, this new edition of a famous old hostelry contains the largest array of electrical program distribution equipment ever installed in one building. Included also in its communication system are approximately 3,700 telephones and 66 teletypewriters; 125 trunk lines connect the hotel with the telephone central office."
"Tests show that thin coatings of some materials reduce the corona losses from high voltage conductors, and that equal losses may be expected from weathered copper and aluminum wires of the same diameter. This investigation was suggested by previous tests (1930) made at the Ryan Laboratory, Stanford University; this earlier work indicated a temporary reduction in losses after the conductors had been cleaned."
"INTERPRETIVE abstracts of all papers presented at the A.I.E.E. Kansas City District meeting (October 22–24, 1931) are presented herewith, excepting only those papers already published in this or preceding issues of Electrical Engineering. Members vitally interested and wishing to obtain immediately pamphlet copies of any of these papers are requested to use the order form appearing on p. 920 of this issue. In response to popular demand and within its space limitations Electrical Engineering subsequently may publish certain of these papers, or technical articles based upon them."
"Electrical Engineering for October 1931, p. 785–7, contained an article based upon this paper. (A.I.E.E. Paper No. 31M8)"
"INDUCTION type relays will of course operate at their intended current values and time settings only when the shape of the current wave applied during a fault is similar to that of the test wave. The shape of the current wave in the relay during fault is dependent upon the wave form of the fault currents and voltages, and the characteristics of current transformers and secondary circuits."
"PUBLISHED in full in Electrical Engineering for October 1931, p. 824–6. Pamphlet copies not available."
"A COMPARATIVELY simple and convenient method is available for solving the division of current in the various sections of an electrical network and obtaining the voltages at the different load points. The method consists essentially of the application of Kirchoff's laws to the solution of a network, the departure from the usual procedure being that instead of solving a number of simultaneous equations, the problem is handled in steps by the superposition of currents. The idea of a circulatory current is introduced when any change in the system is made by a closure between two points in the existing system."
"THE INCREASE in voltage resulting from total or partial loss of load is especially undesirable on waterwheel driven generators because of their regulation characteristics and the fact that they are frequently connected to long lengths of high tension transmission line. The charging current of such lines results in a further increase in voltage. Although various types of relays have been used to trip the generator on the occurrence of excessive voltage or speed, a more desirable method of limiting the voltage is by the use of generator voltage regulator acting in the generator or exciter field circuit."
"A COMPREHENSIVE abstract of this paper was published in Electrical Engineering, October 1931, p. 793–6. (A.I.E.E. Paper No. 31–132)"
"DISTRIBUTION lines from ungrounded 4,800-volt substations of the Detroit Edison Company commonly have several hundred feet of three-phase underground cable between the overhead lines and the station, voltage regulators being connected between the bus and the station end of the cable. Although lightning arresters are connected at the substation bus and at the junctions of the overhead lines and entrance cables, a number of flashovers due to lightning voltage have occurred, consistently between the line terminal of the regulator and the station end of the entrance cable."
"FREQUENCY conversion was determined as the best means of supplying differences between the 25-cycle and 60-cycle loads and generating abilities of the Union Electric Light and Power Company system. The hydroelectric plant at Keokuk, Iowa, was developed as a 25-cycle run-of-river plant to supply the 25-cycle load in that vicinity and to transmit power to St. Louis, where the load is largely 60 cycles. Various possibilities in 25-cycle and 60-cycle steam and hydroelectric plants presented themselves but a frequency converter was decided upon as the most desirable."
"AUTOMATIC switching equipment for the control of two 20,000-kw. frequency changer sets using the Scherbius method of load and power-factor control has been in successful operation at the Page Avenue station of the Union Electric Light and Power Company of St. Louis for almost a year."
"ENGINEERS and persons responsible for the management of engineering projects have a common interest in problems of forecasting population growth and market demands. The soundness of engineering projects depends upon their capacity to fulfil a real demand. Unsoundness or even failure may result from planning and designing engineering projects without regard to industrial and population trends. Similarly city planning, housing and home building projects, educational and social programs of various kinds, ordinarily should be based upon the number of people to be served at some future date and their economic and social characteristics."
"THE RAPID increase in the size and complexity of the toll plant during recent years has emphasized the need for careful advance planning. This involves the development of an ultimate plan which indicates the most economical and desirable toll plant arrangement some 15 years in the future."
"BURIED tape-armored cables possess several advantages over cables carried on pole lines or in underground conduit: 1. Easements for buried tape-armored cable on private rights-of-way may sometimes be obtained more cheaply than for pole lines, as the use of the land for ordinary agricultural activities is not disturbed. 2. Induced currents from paralleling power lines are appreciably less than in unarmored aerial or underground cables, due to the shielding effect of the steel tapes. 3. Cable may be laid to follow the contour of rough country and have sharp bends to avoid obstructions, while conduit must have a fairly even grade and long radius curves to permit cable being pulled through it. 4. Manholes are required at spacings of from 500 to 700 ft. if conduit is provided, while with tape-armored cables, manholes may be omitted except at loading points which normally occur at 6,000-ft. intervals."
"FOR ORDINARY distances of telephone communication, the speed of transmission can be considered as instantaneous. The increasing use of long distances for commercial telephony, however, has introduced time problems in telephone transmission which are of considerable technical interest and difficulty. Although a number of papers have been presented on this subject, none seems to have given a general over-all picture."
"MOST OF THE more important studies of lightning disturbances on transmission lines have been confined to steel tower lines of 110 kv. and above. A field investigation of the effect of lightning on 33-kv. and 66-kv. transmission lines on wood poles is now being carried on, the preliminary investigations having been completed."

"THE FUNCTION of the primary fuse is to clear short circuits, and to minimize disturbances to the system at times of fault. Continuity of service requires that short-time overloads should not cause primary fuses to blow, whereas fire hazard requires that fuses for secondary windings operate on an overload basis. The proper application of primary fuses is dependent upon the determination of the available short-circuit current as well as the value of load current. Another factor which must be given consideration is coordination of fuse and relay time-current characteristics to insure isolation of the fault at the fuse point rather than by the main feeder switch. Minimum time of operation should be sought in the selection of fuses, both to provide maximum flexibility in relay settings and to give minimum system disturbance. The time required for a fuse to blow in the short-circuit current range is more important than at the one or five minute points."
"THE EXPULSION fuse is an extremely simple device used quite extensively for interrupting a-c. circuits of moderate voltage and power. In spite of its apparent simplicity and widespread use, the principles upon which it functions are not at all generally understood. Comparisons of interrupting capacities of a soapstone fuse tube and a fiber fuse tube, support the view that the expulsion fuse depends upon the gas blast produced by rapid decomposition of fuse tube material under the heat of the arc. The effectiveness of the gas blast is stated to be due to the high degree of turbulence it introduces into the confined arc space."
"MANY NEW developments to meet modern requirements have been applied to the renewable expulsion-fuse and oil-fuse cut-outs for a-c. distribution systems of 15,000 volts and below. While there are several different types of fuse cut-outs, the universal design problem is the interruption of an arc formed when the current carrying element melts. Both expulsion-fuse and oil-fuse cut-outs depend for this interruption upon the gas pressure generated by the current in the arc."

"During the last few years the authors have been studying the effect of electricity upon the nervous systems of experimental animals. In this article are discussed briefly the types of changes found in the brain, the spinal cord, and in the nerve cells themselves following an electric shock."
"TEN STREAM-LINE aluminum-body cars capable of a speed of 80 miles per hr. are being placed in service by the Philadelphia and Western Railway Company for suburban traffic. The running time of express cars from Norristown to the 69th Street station in Philadelphia, a distance of 13½ miles, is scheduled to be cut from 24 to 16 min. by these new 52-passenger cars which weigh but 25 tons and are equipped with four 100-hp. motors operating under automatic control. The cars are being constructed by the J. G. Brill Company and the electric equipment is being supplied by the General Electric Company."
"Greater transmitting speeds are possible in submarine telegraph cables when balanced by inductive networks than could be obtained with the older resistance networks. In this article is presented the first exact theory of inductive balances of which two already are in successful practical operation."
"Recent investigations have thrown light on the hither to obscure causes of “cusps” in the speed-torque curves of polyphase induction motors, causing the motors to “crawl” at reduced speed or to be noisy and to vibrate under load. Results of some of these studies are described in the three articles following the introduction below."
"AMONG the suggestions advanced as to the cause of irregularities in the shape of the speed-torque curves of polyphase induction motors which cause them to crawl at reduced speeds or to have excessive vibration and noise, is that the harmonic fluxes introduced by the distribution of the stator and rotor windings in slots may cause these irregularities. However, the conclusions of this analysis are not borne out by the facts, and the investigations on which this article is based show that the most powerful disturbing effects are due not to the distribution of the windings, but to the presence of the slot openings in the stator and rotor."
"CUSPS in the speed-torque curves of induction motors have been attributed to several causes; first, to harmonics in the rotating field; second, to the synchronous locking-in of stator and rotor harmonics as shown by Dreese; and third, to the effect of the slot openings as shown by Kron. The present article is devoted exclusively to the study of the first cause, and indicates that harmonics in the field form do have a very definite effect on the speed-torque curve."
"INDUCTION MOTOR slots are usually skewed to prevent “cogging” and noise on load, but indiscriminate skew irrespective of number of poles, especially when this number is large, leads to very large reduction of short circuit current and motor performance. The reduction of short circuit current is due not so much to increase of leakage reactance as to an unbalanced component of mutual flux."
"THREE independent electrical circuits which are coupled together magnetically may be represented by an equivalent circuit developed from fundamental equations. In general, these transformers may be divided into two distinct types depending upon the relative directions of the mutual fluxes between the three windings. According to C. F. Estwick, (M'25) of the General Railway Signal Company, Rochester, N. Y., who discusses this type of transformer in a current A.I.E.E. paper, any arrangement of three coupled circuits will have the characteristics of either one or the other of the two types mentioned."
"A scheme is described whereby watthour meter readings may be “observed” over regular subscribers' telephone circuits."
"Accurate methods, long available for calculating the temperatures in power cables during steady loads now can be supplemented by methods of calculating cable temperatures during fluctuating loads. Under favorable circumstances these give accuracies within 5 per cent. Further, the method is simple, and calculations can be made readily."
"Intelligent self-interest, individually applied with sincerity of purpose toward the solution of every-day problems, is recommended as the most efficacious way out of present economic troubles.

"Three articles are presented herewith, following a common introduction, all on the same general subject, namely, the extinction of the short a-c. arc at low voltages in air. The importance of this subject is emphasized by the increasing use of the low-voltage a-c. distribution network and of a variety of equipments for interrupting circuits in air."
"REIGNITION OF A-C. ARCS being dependent upon the arc-voltage relations during current zero, a study based on some 200 cathode-ray oscillograms has been made of the voltage and current relationships near the cyclic current zero in arcs between metallic electrodes."
"EXPERIMENTS to determine the influence of such parameters as electrode material, current strength, and arc length on the characteristics of the more common type of stationary arcs with molten electrodes, have given results not previously expected. Simplified calculations made by Slepian a few years ago based on the theory that ions are lost from the arc space only by direct ion recombination, predicted a manner of recovery of dielectric strength substantially the same as that actually revealed by experiments made on cold electrode arcs at about the same time. The rate of recovery of voltage across the arc space following a current zero was controlled by shunting the arc with resistance, and the maximum allowable rate of rise of voltage was determined from the maximum value of shunting resistance at which the arc would just be extinguished after one-half cycle."
"A CLOSE STUDY of the type of arcs occurring with faults in low-voltage a-c. networks and the method by which they are extinguished has brought out several striking conclusions. It has been found that short arcs between copper electrodes and not adjacent to insulation are inadequate to meet the fault-clearing requirements of low-voltage a-c. networks of more than 130 volts. Actual low-voltage networks of voltage higher than 130 depend for extinction of arcs upon the strongly deionizing action of gas blasts coming from decomposing adjacent insulation. As suggested by this result, it has been found also that the extinction of arcs in cables is strongly affected by the closeness of the insulation to the arc. Also, inorganic insulating materials giving off non-combustible gases have been found to be effective in aiding arc extinction, and of the various inorganic materials tried, boric acid was the best. Further, where organic insulation has been charred, it may be expected to lose its property of aiding arc extinction."
"Because several of its basic features differ quite radically from other distribution networks, the engineering plan of the Philadelphia a-c. network is outlined and five years' operating experience is summarized."
"COMPANION papers “Calculation of Synchronous machine constants” by L. A. Kilgore and “Determination of Synchronous machine constants by Test” by S. H. Wright (see footnote) both of the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, have been presented before the A.I.E.E. Until recently the theory of synchronous machines has required relatively few constants; a single value of reactance, usually called armature leakage, has been used to calculate the initial short-circuit current, and standard decrement curves have been applied to determine the rate of current decay. However, the need for greater accuracy in short-circuit and stability calculations has brought into quite general use the new theory involving symmetrical components. The various reactances and time constants affecting transient characteristics must be known in applying the new theory, and consequently there is a real demand for knowledge of these constants."
"MAGNETIC CIRCUITS generally are composed of magnetically different materials which have different characteristics such as magnetization curves, electrical conductivities, and thermal properties. The most important distinction, however, lies in the use of laminated and solid iron parts, both of which show extreme behavior in the case of transient phenomena. When any change of the associated magnetic field takes place, eddy currents are produced in the iron, and these eddy currents produce a reacting magnetic field. This condition delays the rate of change of the resultant field. In the case of laminated iron parts, the very structure of the system limits the amount of eddy current to a negligible value. However, the delay of the growth of the magnetic field in solid iron parts is one of the most important factors in the operation of many types of electrical equipment."
"OSCILLATIONS in transformer and other distributed windings have been subject to analysis both by test and calculation; the mathematical investigation of such oscillations is extended by L. V. Bewley (see footnote). In this paper, the nature of the initial, transient, and final distributions of potential are mathematically analyzed and discussed, showing the effects of the following:"
"Study and analysis of non-linear circuits reveal characteristics which mark them as capable of being adapted to a variety of special uses. A simple series circuit of this type is especially well adapted for relay applications, and obviates some of the undesirable features of mechanical relays."
"Formulas supplementing those previously published and making it possible to calculate the losses in cable sheaths simply and accurately are presented herewith. These cover a wide range of cases."
"THE USUAL vacuum tube harmonic generators are fundamentally high distortion amplifiers operated under conditions of grid bias and plate voltage which, to distort the input voltage wave, utilize the non-linear relation between plate voltage and plate current. A paper published in the June 1931 issue of the A.I.E.E. Transactions (see footnote) gives the result of an investigation into the possibilities of using the non-linear grid voltage-current characteristic to produce harmonics. Grid distortion can be utilized by operating the tube so that the grid goes positive for a part of each fundamental frequency cycle and then inserting in series with the grid lead an impedance across which the grid current impulses produce a voltage drop rich in harmonics, which then is amplified in the plate circuit."
"A resume of some of the important advances made during the past year in the fields of physics and chemistry as applied to the fundamental theory underlying successful electrical insulation."
"PROM published records of flashovers on double-circuit towers which have tripped out both circuits, and from opinions expressed by operating engineers of various power companies, approximately 20 per cent of faults occurring on double-circuit towers involve conductors of both circuits. In addition to these, instances have been reported where faults in substations have involved conductors of circuits not on the same towers. “It seems worth while therefore,” states Edith Clarke (A'23) of the General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y., in a current A.I.E.E. paper, “to have in convenient form, methods for calculating short-circuit currents, and of determining the stability limit of a system when faults occur simultaneously at two separate and distinct points of the system.”"

"After digression to follow specific channels of commercial stimulation, insulation and dielectric research is finding that known facts can be interpreted correctly only with fuller knowledge of underlying fundamentals."
"RESEARCH and development in the field of dielectrics and insulation have resulted in notable progress during the past year. Experimental studies have ranged from fundamental questions in the fields of pure physics and chemistry, through the important intermediate field of effort made to bring together the talents, resources, and enterprise of both pure and applied science to the wide and always active field of direct development by cut-and-try methods for the improvement of insulating materials and structures."
"PAPERS by Doctor J. B. Whitehead and by Prof. K. F. Herzfeld present further results from the extended program of research under way at Johns Hopkins University on the fundamental properties of insulating liquids, with special reference to their use for the impregnation of paper. The general course of these studies has indicated that within the normal operating range of temperature the dielectric loss in insulating oils of the better known types can be entirely accounted for by the conductivity as measured for the very short time intervals corresponding to the period of commercial alternating circuits. In the case of impregnated paper, dielectric loss is entirely accounted for by dielectric absorption as measured under continuous potential. Doctor Whitehead's paper is a further study of the short time conductivities, and has revealed for the first time the presence of dielectric absorption in a liquid. The influence of this on dielectric loss is examined. His own abstract follows:"
"THIS abstract of a preliminary report gives some results of a study of the life of impregnated paper insulation under way at the School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. The work is being supported by the subcommittee on impregnated paper-insulated cable research of the National Electric Light Association. In an earlier work under the same auspices, a study was made of the influence of residual air on dry impregnated-paper insulation. Results of that study (Vol. 47, No. 1 Transactions A. I. E. E., January, 1928) showed the desirability of investigating the effect which different amounts of residual air would have upon the life of impregnated paper insulation. A brief summary of the results so far obtained is given here in the form of eight conclusions, briefly qualified."

"ACCORDING to A. C. Nielsen Company, engineers, Chicago, and J. E. Woods and E. T. Ankele, respectively chief engineer and operating engineer for the Central Power & Light Company, San Antonio, Texas, Lapp standard fog-type insulators have been instrumental in solving a troublesome transmission line problem on the power company's 17-mi., 66-kv. transmission line between Sinton and Robstown, Texas. The line in question is subject alternately to dust and salt fogs, and for some time prior to its reinsulation there occurred an average of some ten insulator failures and consequent service interruption. Analysis of maintenance costs showed an average expenditure of of $152.50 annually to cover necessary replacements, and this together with troubles arising from interruptions to important service brought about a reinsulation which was completed about two and one-half years ago. At that time the 66-kv. pin-type units previously in service were replaced each by three No. 5805 fog-type units. It is stated that insulator failures due to arcover have been eliminated entirely."

"TRANSMISSION line calculations requiring the use of complex hyperbolic functions are materially simplified through the construction and use of a chart from which both the complex hyperbolic sine and cosine values may be determined in either polar or complex-number form. The device is a polar rectangular chart combined with a specially constructed scale graduated in values of ${\\epsilon^{a} \\over 2}$ and ${\\epsilon^{-a} \\over 2}$. The chart should be constructed with angles in circular radians and degrees which may be divided into convenient values. In constructing such a chart for practical use it may be convenient to employ heavy lines to denote each interval of 5 deg. and to subdivide these into degrees by fine lines. Ordinary cross-section paper having ten lines per inch is suitable for the rectangular chart."

Regulation of generator excitation so that it will follow rapid changes in load constitutes a major part in the solution of this involved problem. Data show that the characteristics of all synchronous apparatus connected to a system must be considered."
"WITH the desire to make possible closer grading and duplication of flexible mica sheets, an apparatus called the “fleximeter” has beem developed for the New England Mica Company by W. R. Mansfield of that company, and Willis A. Boughton of the Harvard College chemical laboratory."
"Higher transmitting speeds than had been attained previously were made possible in 1928 by the installation of the high-speed loaded cable between Newfoundland and the Azores. Some of the design features and problems involved in duplex operation are described."
"WORKING in an atmosphere of fine nitrate dust, the 250-hp. Westinghouse synchronous motor shown under construction in the accompanying illustration, obviates the usual danger of nitric-acid damage to its windings. Built to fit their job, the vulnerable parts of these motors are metal-clad and in addition are supplied with a slight static pressure inside to prevent the harmful dust from leaking in. Inclined fins on the metal enclosure not only throw off heat, but guide along the most efficient route the cooling air supplied by the fan on the rotor. Without these odd-looking fins the operating temperature of the motor would be much higher. These motors are designed to operate on 550-volt, 60-cycle circuits and have a synchronous speed of 450 r. p. m."
"With America becoming “noise conscious,” electrical engineers are finding it necessary to devote increasing attention to the reduction of noises caused by electrical machinery. Progress in this direction, both in specially designed instruments and in mitigative measures adopted, is indicated in the accompanying articles."
"A SOUND METER has recently been developed in the Bell System, which measures acoustic noises and sounds in general. The aim has been to have its indications accord with present information on the response of the ear as far as practicable in a simple portable device. The response of the meter to sound impulses, in general an important part of noise, has been carefully considered. There is also under development an attachment to analyze sound both on a single-frequency and band-frequency basis."
"MAGNETIC NOISE in synchronous machines, particularly those of the low-speed class, has been a source of annoyance to both designers and operators, but literature on the general subject of noise is notably free from any discussion of the specific causes of noise in this type of machine. In this article an attempt is made to point out some of the causes of this noise and to show the extent to which they may be controlled by the designer."
"NOISES ORIGINATING from electrical machinery are of two general types, namely, direct air noise, and noise transmitted through the machine foundations to the framework of the enclosing structure. (A. L. Kimball, Journal of the Acoustical Society, Vol. 2, No. 2, Oct. 1930, pp. 297–304.) Disturbances of the latter type often may be reduced by a properly designed elastic support between the machine and building."
"MACHINE NOISE INVESTIGATIONS should include vibration tests at various points on the machine and its support, as well as loudness measurements at various points in the surroundings pace. With the “audio noise meter” described in this article, both types of measurements can be made and information thus obtained is extremely valuable in the study of machine noises, their causes and remedies."
"NOISE REDUCTION IN SUBSTATIONS has in most cases taken the form of confining the noise within certain reasonable limits rather than eliminating it at its source. In accomplishing this, however, other complications are introduced, especially as regards ventilation."
"AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE to the study of noise in induction regulators is the establishment of a method for making quantitative noise measurements. Surroundings have a very great effect on the values of sound intensity; thus for consistent results all sound measurements should be made under identical conditions as regards not only background noises but also surfaces in the vicinity. Induction regulators, however, are usually difficult to handle and it is therefore quite inconvenient to move them to a place suitable for making sound measurements."
"Unlike many lightning and surge investigations which have largely concerned individual pieces of apparatus, the tests outlined here have been made on complete substation units. Qualitative results have been obtained for two classes of stations."
"OFFICE SUNSHINE is provided by a special dual-purpose ceiling fixture recently designed for his office by M. Luckiesh, director of the General Electric Company's lighting research laboratory at Nela Park, Cleveland. A similar fixture is installed in the office of the president of the Cleveland Electric League."
"By the use of arc welding, marked savings have been effected in the manufacture of electrical apparatus. Automatic control for this process has made possible still greater savings and at the same time better and more uniform products."
"Three-winding transformers present difficult problems for the protection engineer. Differential relays which operate on the phase difference between the currents in the different windings are particularly adapted to meet the requirements."
"Automatic regulators to be suitable for industrial use must be quick in response, sturdy in construction, require a minimum of maintenance, and be adaptable to a wide variety of applications. How one of the newer types of carbon-pile regulators meets these exacting requirements is outlined in some detail."
"Large industrial establishments usually are interconnected with electric utility systems for the purchase of power; but free interchange of electric power between the two is not nearly so common as the economies involved would substantiate. The author recommends unrestricted interchange for the best economy in both systems."

"As a result of the noteworthy economic and operating success of the secondary a-c. network the same principle now is proposed for relatively high-voltage primary systems. Based upon economic studies of two Pittsburgh residential areas one primary network now is under construction there and a second all planned. Major details involved are given here and ten distinct advantages are enumerated."
"The extensive use of the high-vacuum tube in radio and communication work has resulted from certain remarkable characteristics of these tubes; the “thyratron” has been shown to possess certain other characteristics which mark it as being equally well suited to industrial uses."
"Are brain cells injured when currents do not pass through the head? What influence upon life continuity does the current path through the body have? In an effort to approach an answer to these and related questions a second set of experimental data is given herewith."
"A brief outline of some of the revolutions in production methods brought about by electrification on a large scale."
"By reducing the magnetic energy stored in the generator field, transient currents in d-c. welding machines can largely be eliminated. Providing such generators with neutralizing windings reduces this energy to a minimum."
"Line-to-ground voltage in three-phase grounded-neutral electric power systems under fault conditions often may be greater than the line-to-line voltage. This and numerous other important relations are shown by an investigation of the wide range of power-system voltages and currents existing under fault conditions."
"For single-line protection, with the exception of pilot-wire, or superposed high-frequency methods, distance relays form the nearest approach to the theoretically ideal system. Except for errors due to fault resistance, these relays operate accurately according to the relative distance to faults."
"A MEMORANDUM of Oliver B. Shallenberger, personally handwritten, and recently come to light, gives an interesting glimpse of the electrical business forty years ago. The man who left this penciled notation was one of the pioneer electrical engineers of the then infant Westinghouse company and was active in many major projects that did much to shape the course of the industry."
"Automatic regulating and control equipment is finding increasing use in telephone power plants, giving more exact performance, increased reliability and reduced maintenance. Certain regulating equipment and a few of the unit-type automatic power plants recently developed are described."
"Current-collection problems can be simplified to a marked degree by helical grooves cut into the surfaces of commutators and slip-rings. Results of comparative tests before and after grooving are presented herewith."
"Predetermination of the temperature in electrical machinery involves three distinct problems: (1) magnitude and distribution of the losses, (2) flow and cooling effect of the cooling medium in the machine, and (3) heat flow from source to cooling medium."
"By means of the integraph the differential equation of motion for a synchronous motor during pulling-into-step transients is readily solved. An expression thus can be set up to predetermine the limiting conditions under which such a motor will synchronize."
"The termination in a telegraph office of a large number of “start-stop” printing telegraph circuits, requires some means for concentrating the circuits to enable incoming and outgoing traffic to be handled efficiently and economically. A multipleturret concentrator which permits any one of many circuits to be worked by any one of a few operators is described here."
"Electric resistance brazing produces in electric conductors joints which possess several distinct advantages over equivalent soldered joints, and in addition can be made at a lower cost. A description of the equipment and process is given with comparative results between the two types of joints."
"A device has been developed which not only provides voltage regulation for alternators, but short-circuit protection as well. Saturation current from the filament of a thermionic tube forms the control element, while stabilization is accomplished by a feed-back system."

"Relay-protection design involves a detailed study not only of the required standards of service but also of the general design and layout of the power system to be protected. The “close-linked” type of system of Chicago and the special relaying system which it demanded, are discussed."
"Thirty years ago great quantities of iron were necessary in cores of electrical devices to prevent undue electrical loss. High temperatures caused magnetic deterioration of the metal. Even alloys of apparently constant chemical composition had varying magnetic properties. In view of this obstacle, progress in transformers of electrical currents was especially difficult."
"More than four years have elapsed since the installation of the first transoceanic radio-telephone circuit between New York and London. Some of the more recent developments in this class of service are discussed here."
"That the concerted efforts of power companies and electrical manufacturers to combat the disturbing influences of lightning already have borne fruit, is attested by the greatly reduced transmission line outages from this cause. Results of recent investigations in this field as described in twelve Institute papers form the basis for the six articles which follow."
"Recent theoretical findings concerning lightning and traveling waves are discussed in this article. When corroborated by field tests, these results furnish information from which a systematic scheme of protection can be established. “Direct-hit” wires above ordinary “sky wires” are suggested and discussed."
"High-voltage impulses simulating lightning surges can be impressed on a line at will, and now provide the most convenient means for studying the characteristics of such waves. Corona is found to be the greatest cause of wave attenuation and distortion; to a lesser extent, skin effect."
"Although lightning surges of as high as 5,000 kv. have been recorded, only about ten per cent of these have crest voltages of more than seven times normal line voltage. One important result of recent investigations is the proof that a direct stroke can occur to a tower or ground wire without causing a flashover."
"Requirements for a “lightning proof” line, where this seems justified economically, are outlined in this article. Insulation alone is not the final answer, only one of several important features of proper line design. A new arrester of the gap type is described also, wherein the breakdown medium is a column of air."
"Operating experiences form the final proving ground of the many theories developed; the efficiency of any scheme of protection may be ascertained accordingly. Although one overhead ground wire already is known to be highly beneficial, two are shown to be unquestionably better. Opinions conflict as to the effect of tower footing resistance."
"On the basis of long practical experience the author condemns the present procedure in patent litigation and outlines the foundation for a proposed single United States Court of Patent Appeals which would be second only to the U. S. Supreme Court and would abolish the duplicate and conflicting efforts of the ten district courts in patent matters. Full text of a proposed House of Representatives bill is given."
"Twin-motor drive has met effectually the repeated demands for more power at the rolls. Other advantages, however, which now far overshadow the improvement originally sought are the direct outcome of the reduced inertia and greater operating flexibility inherent in this type of drive."
"The motor-operated rheostat with its associated apparatus now is replaced by a simpler, more compact vacuum-tube arrangement. The only auxiliary power required can be obtained from an ordinary station-lighting circuit; circuit constants are chosen so that momentary dips in this supply voltage do not affect the readings."
"Discovery of reasons for the well-known beneficial effects of sunlight on health has been a stimulus to efforts to produce artificial sunshine for use when and where natural sunshine is not available. Knowledge of the amounts of energy in various wavelengths of the solar spectrum throughout the year is necessary for production of the best artificial sunlight. Therefore measurements of sunlight in summer, fall, and winter, have been made at two sanatoria, in Ohio and Colorado, where sunlight has been used for years in treating disease. The physicians in charge in Colorado have found that noon winter sunshine has given the best results."
"President A. I. E. E. Engineering enterprise has developed so rapidly from the application of individual technical skill to the combined technical efforts of many and variously qualified persons, that it seems propitious to consider briefly one of the most important of the present controlling features. A modern engineering undertaking of any appreciable size whatever involves influencing factors ranging all the way from the purely political to the purely economic; from the purely theoretical to the most simple and practical. Each of these factors of necessity must contribute its share to the ultimate design or structure, each to be interpreted and applied by a skilled technologist. Thus it is that coordination, hackneyed word though it be, comes to the fore as representing a function without which no engineering enterprise of any magnitude may hope to succeed in the full sense of that word."

"CONSIDERABLE data on many phases of the automatic station art have been collected by subcommittees and are made part of this report, which is treated under headings as follows:"
"IN accordance with the usual practise, this committee submits herewith a brief review of the developments during 1930 in electrical communication."
"THIS report consists of two sections; the first dealing with the Organization and Policies, and the second with the Progress of the Art."
"I. Organization and Activities THE committee is organized with five permanent subcommittees, and its work has consisted of the review of papers, arrangement of programs for technical sessions, and the preparation of Standards and Test Codes."
"THIS report covers the period 1929 and 1930, inasmuch as no report was made in 1929. It is believed worthwhile to indicate the magnitude of the electrochemical and electrometallurgical industries in terms of installed capacity and yearly power consumption. The figures for the United States are as follows:"
"THE annual report of the Committee on Electrophysics has generally taken the form of an account of the progress in the field of electrophysics during the preceding year. In view of the steady increase of the activity in this field the matter to be covered has increased greatly, and the report for the year 1929–1930 was a lengthy one in spite of all efforts to keep its size down to a minimum."
"THE principal activity of the Committee during the past year has been in arranging and carrying out of plans for the Industrial Session held at the Winter Convention. As this Committee is interested in the application of electricity to all industries which are not specifically covered by other committees of the Institute, it was agreed that papers to be of interest to the greatest number of engineers should be of a general nature and not confined to a specific industry or application. The papers presented were consequently arranged and prepared with this thought in mind. During this period of industrial depression an increasing amount of attention is being given to the subject of reducing manufacturing costs and it was hoped that industrial engineers would find in these papers various ideas which could be applied to their own problems."
"THE Committee on Instruments and Measurements has been active during the past year on the following subjects:"
"THE functions of this committee have, in the past, been largely confined to (1) encouraging the presentation of papers before the Institute dealing with those phases of electrical engineering which are major factors in the utilization of electricity in the steel industry. (2) To preparing an annual report which briefly summarizes such phases of the application of electricity to the production of iron and steel as are considered new or of special interest to the membership."
"Production of Light Statistics on Incandescent Lamp Sales THE sale of incandescent lamps held up remarkably well during the past year, large lamps showing a decrease of about 1 per cent as compared with 1929. The Central Station revenue derived from the two classes of service in which light is a large factor (domestic and commercial, small power and light) showed an increase of about 7.5 per cent as compared with the previous year, offsetting the reduction from other uses of electricity, and leaving a net increase of about 3 per cent."
"THERE has been a minimum of new installations made this year owing to the general depression. Hoists. Probably fewer hoists have been installed than in many past years. It is interesting to note that two manufacturing companies alone report that combined they have sold to date nearly 800 induction motor hoists from 200 to 1,800 hp. in size, and over 100 variable control d-c. hoists from 200 to 5,000 hp., the latter two motors in series."
"THE major items of activity of the committee for the current term have been: a. Reprinting Standards No. 45 — Recommended Practise for Electrical Installations on Shipboard. b. Promoting licensing of the electrical operating personnel on shipboard. c. Keeping in touch with electric propulsion of ships and the electrification of auxiliaries on shipboard."
"TWO meetings of the entire committee were held during the year, one at the Philadelphia District Meeting on October 14, 1930, and the second at the Winter Convention in New York on January 28, 1931. In addition to the regular survey of immediate developments and problems in the scope of the committee, a continuing organization or method was adopted through which news items on the subject of power generation will be reported for publication in Electrical Engineering. Each member of the committee was asked to appoint some one of his business associates as a permanent news correspondent to represent his particular affiliation irrespective of membership in the future on the Power Generation Committee. The subject of interconnection continued to occupy the major attention of the committee, and especially of the Joint Interconnection Subcommittee on which Messrs. F. C. Hanker, F. H. Hollister, and A. E. Silver represented the Power Generation Committee. The formation of this subcommittee composed of members from the Power Generation, Power Transmission and Distribution and Protective Devices Committees, was predicted in last year's report, and the subcommittee has functioned throughout the year under Mr. Hanker's chairmanship not only to the fullest extent, but has also promoted a close working arrangement among the three main committees in dealing with a subject that has many common elements."
"THE Committee has continued with its work during the past year through a number of subcommittees organized as in preceding years. All of these subcommittees have been very active in studying the problems in their respective fields, and in promoting investigation work and the preparation of papers for presentation before the Institute. The reports of the work of the several subcommittees follow."
"YOUR Committee on Transportation submits a brief review of the recent developments of importance in the application of electricity to transportation."
"THE work of the Committee on Protective Devices during the past year was accomplished largely through subcommittees, which are listed below with their chairmen:"
"DURING the year the Committee members have reviewed twenty-six papers and recommendations have been made to Headquarters for their disposition. Each paper has been reviewed by three or more members and outside experts. The Committee held one session at the Winter Convention at which eight of the approved papers were presented. Additional papers, obtained through the Committee on Research, are scheduled for the Summer Convention and several papers made available for district meetings. All business was carried on through correspondence as the only Committee meeting scheduled, at the Winter Convention, had to be abandoned because of conflicts. The following topics are of sufficient importance to be called to the attention of the electrical engineering profession. The subjects reported have all been suggested by the Committee members, special assistance having been given by Messrs. W. G. Cady, V. Karapetoff, H. H. Race, D. W. Roper, T. Spooner, and J. B. Whitehead."

"For the first time in his more than forty years of aggressive leadership in the electrical industry the Institute's new president takes a position vacated by another. Always he has pioneered, developing new processes, new departments, new products, new refinements; now he assumes leadership of the Institute. It is confidently to be expected that Doctor Skinner's pioneer spirit, keen foresight, and indomitable courage will prove invaluable to the Institute. His brief message follows."
"A new approach to an important problem in the field of electric power is offered by the author, who limits his discussion to the possibilities of tuned lines rather than their practical application. He presents the results of extensive research work, and on the basis of laboratory experiments points out that through the use of higher transmission frequencies, the efficiency of a given line might be increased as much as 500 per cent."
"In this article are presented the principal findings of the Institute's joint interconnection subcommittee after canvassing 32 of the country's leading power companies. By comparing the results with those outlined in a similar report made in 1923, several noteworthy trends are indicated. Of particular note is a decided drift toward solid grounding."
"THROUGHOUT THE AGES man has dreamed of relief from toil, of the bountiful supplying of his needs, and the attainment of comfort and luxury. He has struggled toward an ideal state in which these satisfactions might be enjoyed by all. From their beginnings the literature of all peoples has contained many expressions of man's aspiration for the “better life.” Since happiness ever has been a condition earnestly desired by human beings the time seems propitious to ask — what has engineering done for humanity's progress toward this objective? What have engineers by their applications of scientific knowledge, by their control of nature's forces, by their improved and ever increasing utilization of new raw materials, or by their salvage of former wastes accomplished for the good of mankind."
"A noted research worker, head of a modern laboratory, decides that the life of the future will simulate the life of the ancients; built, however, on a foundation of modern engineering."
"An underground distribution system comprising duplicate 11-kv. primary feeders and an isolated network secondary system is adopted to supplement existing d-c. and radial 2.4-kv. systems. Provsion for burn-off is not made; special junction boxes were developed."
"Although what appears to be a multiplicity of different types of gaseous-conduction lamps have been developed, these are classified into a total of only sixteen groups. Outstanding developments in this class of lighting also are described in this article."
"The high-voltage cold-cathode neon tube as developed for commercial sign lighting is one of the few types of gaseous-conduction lamps to gain prominence. Their operating characteristics and associated transformer equipment are described in this article, and their advantages pointed out."
"Progress made during the past year in the study of the propagation of electric waves is reported upon briefly by the A. I. E. E. electrophysics committee."
"Electrical instruments by giving accurate and reliable indications of direction, altitude, and of operating, traffic, and weather conditions, are contributing to safe flight even in dense fogs. Liberal use of instruments now available and development work along the line of new devices, are hastening the time when air transportation will compare favorably with other types."
"Errors in both the producer's total meter registrations and the consumer's single meter registration are analyzed and evaluated by the “probable error” method. Accuracies better than 0.5 per cent are shown to be valueless from a practical standpoint."
"A MAN set out to find a cheap substitute for platinum. He was so successful that for almost a year his results were not taken seriously."
"A formula is given for the mutual impedance between two insulated wires of negligible diameter lying on the surface of the earth and grounded at their end-points."
"An extensive series of tests on standard and experimental cables installed in accordance with standard accepted practise for a-c. low-voltage underground networks, are outlined in this article. Results obtained are useful not only in determining mains-conductor size and network-transformer spacing, but also for indicating desirable future developments in cables for this service."
"Effects of transient voltage phenomena upon auto-transformer design are discussed briefly. Results given are based upon tests."
"A neutralizing d-c. transformer removes troublesome transients from current output of welding generator."
"Telegraph line efficiencies and signal distortion measurements are only two of the many uses for this unique device. By means of an unusual electrochemical recorder, time intervals of one ten-thousandth of a second in the opening and closing of electrical circuits are graphically recorded."
"In the latest issue of the A. I. E. E. Standards (May, 1930), Sec. 13, Par. 13–306, the following appears:"
"The quest for a better understanding of important problems underlying the improvement of electrical insulation is proceeding definitely through channels of research into related fundamentals, as outlined in the January issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (pp. 24–29). During the first half of 1931 some seven papers have been presented before Institute conventions and District meetings covering certain specific efforts in insulation research. Two of these papers concerned themselves with cable oils, two with impregnated paper, and three devoted primary attention to mathematical attacks upon insulation problems. In whole or in part in several instances these same papers were discussed at the Washington, D. C. meeting (Nov. 7–8, 1930) of the National Research Council's electrical insulation committee, which conference was comprehensively reviewed in the January 1931 issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. All of the papers in question have been reviewed briefly in current news reports appearing in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, but because of the importance of the subject and for the benefit of those it may serve, the following group of brief abstracts is published."
"Continuous-current characteristics of several insulating oils are studied for time intervals beginning 0.001 sec. after the application of voltage or short circuit. Essential equipment is the amplifier oscillograph in connection with a quick-acting switch. It is found that in one group of oils there is an initial conductivity which is constant over the period of the first second following the application of the voltage. Thereafter there is a slow decrease of conductivity to a final value much lower than the initial value. It is shown that this initial constant conductivity is sufficient to account for all of the dielectric loss under alternating stress."
"Routine measurements of d-c. resistivity are dealt with in the first part of this paper, along with a description of a quartz-insulated testing cell and a portable testing set for use with it. Absolute resistivity between 1 × 109 and 1 × 1013 ohms can be measured at any temperature up to 150 deg. cent. Among the conclusions are:"
"First results are given in this discussion covering a study of the separate electrical behavior of the paper, the impregnating oil, and the combination thereof which constitutes impregnated insulating paper. Where possible, efforts were made to determine the relationship existing between fundamental and final characteristics."
"THIS is the third of a series of studies into the still open question of the influence of residual air and moisture upon the properties of impregnated-paper insulation. The influence of residual moisture was found to be universally bad and increasing amounts of such moisture are immediately reflected in higher values of power factor and loss and in other evidence of instability. One of the most striking results of the earlier studies was the relatively small effect of residual air upon the shape of the voltage-power factor curves. The shape of these curves was not appreciably affected in the range of evacuation pressure from 1 to 10 cm. Hg. abs. and furthermore the curves were flat up to 300 volts per mil and 50 deg. cent. Only at impregnation pressures above 25 cm. Hg. do the typical rising power factor-voltage curves become evident. Upon dissection, dryness and gas voids always were associated with rising power factor-voltage curves, and apparently-excellent impregnation with the flat curves."
"This paper constitutes a theoretical investigation of the effect of insulation variability in determining the breakdown voltage of systems containing large areas of insulation, or large numbers of units of insulation in parallel. It is based upon the idea that a failure in the insulation of a system, like that of a chain, depends upon the strength of the weakest part, or unit; and that the greater the number of units in a system and the greater the variability among the units the greater will be the likelihood of a failure. The analysis, therefore, makes use of the laws of probability which incidentally are more exact and of greater practical importance than is generally believed."
"The purpose of this paper is to correlate the work which has been done on thermal breakdown and to put it in a form in which it can be used by the electrical engineer in the calculation of breakdown voltage. Besides a treatment of the Fock theory, the paper includes the derivation of new formulas for breakdown of very thin and very thick samples and for internal temperature rise and current."
"Imperfect condensers usually are represented by equivalent electrical circuits consisting either of a pure capacitance and a resistance in series or by a pure capacitance and a resistance (or conductance) in parallel. Algebraic relationships existing among these circuit parameters are well known and commonly are used in dielectric study and electric circuit computations. For most dielectrics the equivalent series and parallel capacitances are essentially equal; in this paper examples are given where this is far from true."
"Switzerland is one of the few countries fortunate in having at its disposal more water power than its inhabitants can use conveniently. Hydroelectric power now is supplied to 90 per cent of the total population and to 98 per cent of all municipalities."
"Advertisement of available employment opportunities."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"ONE hundred years ago, Michael Faraday in the Laboratory of the Royal Institution, London, discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction. In this fundamental discovery lies the origin of the dynamo, the transformer, and the repeating coil-basic factors in the utilization of electricity for the purposes of man."
"The general problem of subscriber interconnection is stated here, while some of the economic and service factors in the selection of trunking systems are briefly considered. The characteristic manner in which telephone calls fall upon ordinary straight trunk groups is presented from both common sense and theoretical standpoints. One of the widely used trunk rearrangements by which an improved capacity may be achieved under certain conditions is known as graded multiple. A theoretical analysis of this scheme is given, from which are constructed curves for common probabilities of loss. Illustrative examples are included to make clear their use. A detailed comparison between theory and observation is made with considerable attention paid to critically examining the validity of the assumptions underlying the theory. It is concluded that the present graded multiple engineering tables are based upon a proper modification of the theoretical formula."
"A description is given of a moving-coil head receiver and a microphone designed particularly for high quality transmission. The instruments have a substantially uniform response from 40 to 10,000 c.p.s. This uniformity of response has been obtained, without sacrifice of sensitivity, by the use of light moving parts and the association of special types of acoustic networks with the diaphragm. In practical use the microphone has a sensitivity about 10 db higher than that of the Western Electric 394 Condenser Microphone."
"This paper describes the results of the simultaneous operation of radio stations WHO and WOC broadcasting the same program on a common frequency using independent crystal controlled oscillators. These stations had previously been compelled to share time on 1000 kc and each is now able to render full time service. The exceptional stability of the crystal controlled oscillators used at each station is described. Since even these oscillators require occasional readjustment to maintain them in isochronism, a monitoring receiver was established midway between the stations and the resultant program is sent back by wire line to WOC to provide an indication for readjusting its frequency to exact isochronism with WHO. An audio oscillator used to modulate the carriers in the monitoring receiver provides a tone independent of the program for the guidance of the operator. Curves are presented showing the quality impairment caused by different degrees of isochronism and signal strength ratios. The improvement in distant reception with simultaneous operation is reported and an explanation given. The impaired reception in the area midway between the stations and outside their normal service range is shown to be a function of the degree of modulation of each transmitter, of the field strength ratio and of the audio phase angle and independent of the carrier phase at the transmitters. It is pointed out that reception equal to that from either station alone may still be obtained in this area by the use of a simple directive antenna. The marked increase in the service rendered by these stations through simultaneous operation is indicative of the improved service that can be rendered to urban areas by common frequency broadcasting. Although it is probable that the high powered station on a cleared channel will remain the best means of affording a high-grade service to a metropolitan area while also rendering an acceptable service to large rural areas, common frequency broadcasting now appears to offer definite means by which to provide an improved coverage to a number of noncontiguous communities."
"This paper describes certain arrangements which have been used for start-stop printing telegraph operation over a transatlantic long-wave radio channel and also describes results obtained from certain tests of long-wave teletypewriter transmission from Rocky Point, L, I., to Rochester, N. Y. A prediction of year-round results is obtainable by correlation of these test data with year-round noise measurement data taken at Houlton, Maine, in connection with transatlantic telephone service."
"This paper describes the use of an electro-acoustic system, transmitting the audible frequency range almost uniformly, in determining by ear the frequency ranges required for faithful reproduction of music, speech, and certain noises. Sounds were reproduced alternately with and without filters limiting the frequency range transmitted by the electrical circuit. The filter cut-offs producing just noticeable changes in the reproduction were deduced from judgments of listeners as to the presence or absence of filters. It was found that for absolute fidelity all musical instruments except the piano require reproduction of the lowest fundamentals. The frequencies above 5000 cycles were shown to be important, some instruments and particularly noises requiring reproduction to the upper audible limit. Tests were made in which experienced listeners judged the degradation of “quality” produced by a series of filters. The judgments showed definitely that the quality continues to improve as the frequency range is extended down to 80 or up to 8000 cycles. Although somewhat indefinite on cut-offs outside these limits, they indicated that reproduction of the full audible range was considered most nearly perfect."
"In this paper are described experiments made at the Cavendish Laboratory, in Vienna, in Chicago and elsewhere during the last fifteen years in which atom nuclei have been disrupted by swiftly moving alpha particles ejected by radioactive materials. Whether an atom is an atom of gold, or of tin, or of praesodymium, or one of some other of the ninety-two varieties is determined solely by the magnitude of its nuclear charge. When the disruption of atom nuclei occurs spontaneously, as it does among atoms of the radioactive elements, the fragments are nuclei of charge different from that of the exploded atom. When disruption is brought about by design, as it is in the experiments described in this article, we have again the disappearance of atoms of one species and the appearance of atoms of other species. The cases differ in that in the first the action goes on without let or hindrance, while in the second it is, to a certain extent, under the control of the experimenter. The experimenter may, if he chooses, congratulate himself on having solved the age old problem of the transmutation of elements. However, transmutation as such is not the object of these investigations. If it were their success would have to be rated as altogether negligible, for the quantities of material transmuted are much less than can be detected chemically. The real object of the work, as is made abundantly clear, has been to verify and to extend our knowledge of the constitution of the nucleus. This is a subject about which a great deal is yet to be learned, but one on which the physicist has already many strong convictions based on a considerable array of interrelated and consistent data. The various conclusions regarding the constitution of atom nuclei which had been reached before any of these experiments on artificial disintegration were made, are discussed. The results of the investigations described confirm and extend our knowledge of the constitution of the nucleus."
"Part 1 of this paper discusses the relative importance of the factors which limit the intelligibility of short-wave radio telephone communication. The more important of these factors are inherent set noise, external noise (static, etc.), and signal fading. The possibility of counteracting these limitations through antenna directivity is indicated. Part 2 describes an antenna system which maintains a desirable degree of directivity throughout a broad continuous range of frequencies. The cost of this antenna is more favorable than that of many types of fixed frequency antennas of equal effectiveness."
"Notes on Radio Transmission.1 Clifford N. Anderson. Considerable data on radio transmission have been obtained the past few years in connection with the establishment and operation of various radio-telephone services by the Bell System. It is the purpose of these notes to present certain aspects of some of the se data which may be of interest in the development of a general physical picture of radio transmission and in indicating the effects of disturbances accompanying storms in the earth's magnetic field."
"AUSTIN BAILEY, A.B., University of Kansas, 1915; Ph.D., Cornell University, 1920; Instructor in Physics, Cornell University, 1915–1 8; Signal Corps, U.S.A., 1918–19; Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Kansas, 1921–2 2: Department of Development and Research, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 1922–. Dr. Bailey's work while with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has been largely along the line of methods for making radio transmission measurements and of long wave radio problems."
"Kinematic and statistical descriptions of the physical aspects of speech and music are given in this paper. As the speech or music proceeds, the kinematic description consists in giving the principal melodic stream, namely, the pitch variation and also the intensity and the quality variations. For speech and song, the quality changes are principally described by giving, besides the main melodic stream, two secondary melodic streams corresponding, respectively, to the resonant pitches of the throat and mouth cavities. To this must also be added the positions of the stops and the high pitched components of the fricative consonant sounds as functions of the time. The statistical description consists in giving the average, the peak, and the probable variations of the power involved as the various kinds of speech and music proceed. These general ideas are illustrated by numerous experimental data taken by various instrumental devices which have been evolved in the Laboratories during the past fifteen years."
"A mathematical discussion of the statistical characteristics of Random Disturbances in terms of their “energy-frequency spectra” with applications to such typical disturbances as telegraph signals and “static”."
"In this paper are discussed bridge methods for locating resistance faults on cable wires, with special reference to the theory of methods for (1) locating insulation faults which cause complete cable failure, (2) locating insulation faults of high resistance, and (3) locating series resistance unbalances. The methods described are better adapted to the toll than to the exchange telephone cable plant, since they require that the conductor resistances of the wires used for measurements be equal and, in general, that measurements be made from each end of the faulty cable."
"This paper presents a formula for the mutual impedance between two insulated wires of negligible diameter lying on the surface of the earth and grounded at their end-points. The formula holds for frequencies which are not too high to allow all displacement currents to be neglected. For any two elements dS, ds of the two wires the mutual impedance is obtained from their direct-current mutual impedance by introducing the complex factor $2(\\gamma r)^{2} [1-(1 + \\gamma r ) e^{{-}\\gamma r}]$ in the reactance term, γ being the propagation constant in the earth, and r the distance between the elements dS and ds."
"Voltages during transient conditions in a grounded wire lying on the earth's surface due to current in a second grounded wire also on the earth's surface are formulated for types of transient currents ordinarily obtained in a.-c. and d.-c. circuits. The fundamental formula is for voltage due to a unit step current, that is, a current zero for time less than zero, and unity for time greater than zero: curves are given for the function determining this voltage for a wide range of values of its two parameters. The formulas for other types of currents are not well adapted for numerical computation, which should be more conveniently carried out by numerical integration using the above curves."
"This paper describes developments in the manufacture of lead covered paper insulated telephone cable completed during the past three years. The introduction describes the manner in which cable is used in the telephone system and briefly outlines the manufacturing processes and equipment as they existed about three years ago. The new developments are then treated in considerable detail, the most outstanding of which are the application of wood pulp insulation direct on the wire instead of spirally wrapping manila rope ribbon paper; new equipment for vacuum drying and storing cable in which a large storage room of unique construction is provided with conditioned air at a relative humidity of .5 per cent at 100° F.; the central melting of large quantities of lead alloy and its distribution through piping systems to a number of lead presses; improved and larger sheathing presses; and precision electrical testing of the finished cable. Most of these improvements are incorporated in the new Baltimore Cable Plant of the Western Electric Company."
"The formulas for the self and mutual impedances of ground return circuits are derived without restricting the ground permeability. Curves are given to show the effect of a ground permeability 1.7 on the mutual impedance between two parallel ground return circuits with the wires lying on the ground."
"This paper discusses negative resistances and impedances. It describes their properties and some devices by which they may be produced physically. Certain properties of negative impedances when used as series and shunt boosters for amplifying speech waves in telephone circuits are discussed. The paper concludes with a description of the circuit and properties of the twin 21-type repeater."
"This paper summarizes the work of the Sectional Committee on Wood Poles of the American Standards Association covering the preparation of specifications for northern white cedar, western red cedar, chestnut and southern pine poles. The major problems underlying the development of standard ultimate fiber stresses, standard dimension tables and practical knot limitations are discussed and illustrated by supporting tables or figures. Graphical charts comparing the old and the new dimensional classifications are described. The main points relating to the material requirements for the four pole species are outlined briefly."

"I Understand I am expected to outline shor tly what has 100 to the splendid coope rat ion between the Associated Companies of the American Bell Telephone Sys tem and the Power Companies of the United States in the matter of coordinating their facilities to avoid interfe rence with the service of either."
"The general (rends in telephone and electric power systems are outlined and the reactions of certain of these trends on coordination are described. In the telephone system, brief mention is made of the rapid growth of the dial system of operation, improvements in subscriber-station apparatus, rapid extension of new types of facilities for toll circuits and the growth of connections to foreign countries. Improvements in telephone service increase the importance of securing adequate coordination. The advantages of the use of cable facilities for toll circuits, of repeaters, of carrier current systems as regards coordination of long distance and interurban telephone circuits are discussed. The benefits accruing from improved subscriber-station apparatus, central office equipment, abandonment of iron wire for the short tributary toll circuits and new methods of making sleeves at joints in open wire lines are outlined. In the power system, brief mention is made of increasing use of larger generating units, and growing use of automatic devices to replace manual operation. Improvements in power service generally react favorably on coordination. The general trends toward higher voltages for transmission and distribution and the improved standards of construction accompanying these trends are described. The important matter of system stability and the practises as regards grounding of transmission circuit neutrals, lightning control and current limiting devices, and the reactions of these matters on coordination are out lined. Reference is also made to grounding of distribution system neutrals, service taps on transmission lines, general practises as regards transformer connections and improvements in wave shape in so far as these matters react on coordination. In conclusion, it is pointed out that, while there have been influences working both favorably and unfavorably toward coordination, the preponderant trend is definitely toward an improvement. The benefits which have accrued from the activities of the Joint General Committee and the important function of the Joint Subcommittee on Development and Research are also mentioned."
"The work of finding out the technical facts bearing on the problems of the physical relations of power and telephone circuits was intrusted to the Joint Subcommittee on Development and Research of the National Electric Light Association and the Bell System. This paper has to do with this fact-finding work so far as it concerns noise frequency induction. The work on inductive coordination may be classified into three groups of factors: 1. Influence factors which concern the characteristics of the power circuits. 2. Susceptiveness factors which concern the characteristics of the communication circuits. 3. Coupling factors which concern the interrelation of power and communication circuits. The paper discusses these various factors in detail and describes the work done by the committee or in progress regarding them. References are given to published reports and papers which present the results of technical studies already completed. Many of the existing noise frequency induction problems have arisen because of the development of the art of the two industries without such close cooperation between them as now exists. It is becoming evident, from the work of this Joint Subcommittee, that while it is not practicable to design machinery and apparatus for power systems to be entirely free of harmonics, or to ideally balance either power or telephone circuits, it is possible to control these factors within limits which, in conjunction with the control of coupling obtainable by cooperative planning of routes and coordination of transpositions, permit satisfactory operation of both services without unduly burdening either."
"This paper deals with coordination of power and telephone systems with respect to induction at power system frequency, usually 60 cycles. The principal problem in this field relates to effects produced under abnormal conditions on power systems. The factors controlling the magnitude, frequency of occurrence, duration, and effects, of induced voltages, are discussed. Different types of protective measures, some applicable to power systems and others to communication systems, are outlined, including their respective advantages, limitations, and fields of application. The reaction on this problem of lightning and of situations involving liability of contacts between telephone wires and power wires is touched upon. The whole matter is treated from the standpoint of the comprehensive joint investigation of the interference problem which is being conducted by the N.E.L.A. and the Bell System."
"Because of the necessity of reaching the same customers, electric supply and telephone lines commonly use the same streets and highways. In urban communities, the joint use of poles for these two services has been very widely adopted and practises for joint use construction have been established from experience gained in past years. In rural communities, joint use is not always practicable or economical. Joint use involves many engineering and economic problems which have received the careful consideration of the Joint General Committee of the National Electric Light Association and Bell Telephone System. This paper describes some of the problems which have been encountered in joint use, and briefly outlines the work which is being conducted by the Joint General Committee in connection therewith. It is concluded that in specific cases proposed for joint use all factors should be studied cooperatively by the companies concerned and that everything practicable should be done to facilitate joint use construction and extend its usefulness."
"The papers which have been presented here today bring out clearly the progress which has been made by the power and telephone companies in the study and development of methods for coordinating their facilities. It seems to me that this is an outstanding-example of whatca nbe accomplished through joint study and cooperative methods generally."
"The development of intercontinental telephony through the agency of radio links connecting between the land networks is traced and its present trends indicated. A description is given of the facilities employed by the Bell System for overseas connections and connections to ships at sea. The transmission results secured with these facilities are set forth and some peculiar short-wave phenomena discussed. International problems of frequency use and conservation are briefly summarized. A fairly comprehensive bibliography of technical papers on transoceanic telephony is included at the end of the paper."
"A comprehensive description of the two-way television system now being demonstrated between the American Telephone and Telegraph Company building, and the Bell Telephone Laboratories, in New York City, has been published elsewhere. Part of that account gives the essential features of the optical arrangements whereby the users of the apparatus are appropriately lighted, and are assured against visual discomfort from the scanning operation. Since the apparatus was first installed, however, some important changes have been made in the distinctively optical features, whereby the performance of the system has been notably improved, and its operation considerably simplified. These changes deserve description, and the present account is mainly concerned with them, although for the sake of completeness some details previously described are included."
"Bayes' theorem made its appearance as the ninth proposition in an essay which occupies pages 370 to 418 of the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. 53, for 1763. An introductory letter written by Richard Price, “Theologian, Statistician, Actuary and Political Writer,”1 begins thus:"
"The problem of terminal wave-filter impedance characteristics is considered in this paper, in particular that of obtaining an approximately constant wave-filter impedance in the transmitting bands of a wave-filter of any class, which is of importance where the wave-filter is terminated by a Constant resistance, the usual case. The solution obtained is based upon the repealed use of the methods of deriving wave-filter structures which gave the M-types, combined with composite wave-filter principles. The results are wave-filter transducers which at one end have standard “constant k” image impedances and at the other have image impedances which can theoretically be made constant in the transmitting bands to any degree of approximation desired. Practical fixed structures are shown. Parts I and II give this derivation and composition of wave-filter structures. Two allied subjects, respectively, the designs of networks which simulate the impedances of wave-filters, and of loaded lines, are dealt with in Parts III and IV, such designs making use of the previous results. The four Appendices contain new reactance and wave-filter frequency theorems, particular fixed transducer designs and certain equivalents; also, a chart for determining terminal losses at the junction of such a fixed wave-filter transducer and a resistance termination. This chart supplements those previously given in a chart method of calculating wave-filter transmission losses."

"The present paper contains an analysis of the detection of two waves modulated with the same, or with different, audio frequencies and differing in carrier frequency by several cycles or more. Both parabolic and straight line detectors are treated and there are derived the expressions for all of the important audio frequencies present in the output of these detectors when such waves are impressed. There are discussed the types of interference which result when one station is considerably weaker than the other and simple attenuation formulæ are employed in estimating the character and extent of the interference areas around the two transmitters. Beyond the use of such formulæ no attention is given to phenomena which may occur in the space medium such as fading, diurnal variations in field intensity, etc."
"An apparatus for photographically recording hysteresis loops and initial magnetization curves is described. It employs a rotating drum and a fluxmeter, the restoring torque of the latter being completely counter-balanced by a photoelectric cell arrangement. With this apparatus curves may be taken so slowly that eddy currents are negligible. The accuracy of the instrument is intrinsically as great as that of a ballistic galvanometer. An analysis of sources of error is included."
"A bar to the attainment of television images having a large amount of detail is set by the practical difficulty of generating and transmitting wide frequency bands. An alternative to a single wide frequency band is to divide it among several narrow bands, separately transmitted. A three-channel apparatus has been constructed in which prisms placed over the holes in a scanning disc direct the incident light into three photoelectric cells. The three sets of signals are transmitted over three channels to a triple electrode neon lamp placed behind a viewing disc also provided with prisms over its apertures so that each electrode is visible only through every third aperture. An image of 13,000 elements is thus produced. For the successful operation of the multi-channel system, it is imperative to have very accurate matching of the characteristics in the several channels."
"Of the numerous microphones which have been developed since Bell's original work on the telephone, only two are used extensively in sound recording for motion pictures, namely, the condenser microphone and the carbon microphone. The condenser microphone was first proposed in 1881 but owing to its low sensitivity was limited in its field of usefulness until the development of suitable amplifiers. In 1917, E. C. Wente published an account of the work which he had done on a condenser microphone having a stretched diaphragm and a back plate so designed as to introduce an appreciable amount of air damping. The major portion of the condenser microphones used today in sound recording embody the essential features of the Wente microphone. Marked progress has, however, been made in the design and construction of these instruments with the result that they are not only more sensitive but also more stable. The factors which contribute to this improvement are described in detail in this paper. Recently a number of articles have appeared in the technical press calling attention to certain discrepancies between the conditions under which the thermophone calibration of the condenser microphone is made and those which exist in the studio. The nature of these discrepancies and their bearing on the use of the microphone are discussed. Microphones in which the sound pressure on the diaphragm produces changes in the electrical resistance of a mass of carbon granules interposed between two electrode surfaces have been used commercially since the early clays of the telephone. In recent years the faithfulness of the reproduction obtained with the carbon microphone has been materially improved by the introduction of an air damped, stretched diaphragm and a push-pull arrangement of two carbon elements. This instrument is finding extensive use in sound recording and reproduction fields where carbon noise is not an important factor. The outstanding design features of the push-pull carbon microphone are described in this paper and suggestions made as to the precautions to be taken in its use if the best quality, maximum life, etc. are to be obtained."
"This paper analyzes the performance of antenna arrays as influenced by certain variables within the control of the designing engineer. It starts with an extremely simple analysis of the interfering effects produced by two sources of waves of the same amplitude. This is followed by a short discussion of a paper by Ronald Foster, which considers two antennas and also 16 antennas when arranged in linear array. Two antennas separated in space by 1/4 wave-length and in phase by 1/4 period give sensibly more radiation in one direction than in the opposite. This, for convenience, has been called a unidirectional couplet. A number of these couplets may be arranged in linear array, thereby giving an extremely useful directive system. Diagrams are shown for such arrays as affected by the number and spacings of the individual couplets. The gains from such arrays are calculated and data are given showing fair agreement between calculation and observation. Directional diagrams for arrays of coaxial antennas indicate that somewhat less gain may be expected from this form than when the elements are spaced laterally. Combinations of these two types of arrays give marked directional properties in both their horizontal and vertical planes of reference. This principle has been used rather generally in short-wave communication. This paper also discusses effects resulting from combining two or more arrays. In one case the space between two arrays tends to emphasize spurious lobes. The directional diagram of such a combination may be rotated within limits by changing the phasing between adjacent arrays or sections of an array. In all of the above cases the influence of the earth is ignored. A mathematical appendix gives general equations for calculating directional diagrams of linear arrays. Special cases of these equations apply to the figures included in the main part of the text. General equations are also given for calculating the gains of arrays. Similar equations permit the areas of diagrams to be calculated. An extended bibliography on antenna arrays is appended."
"Several methods have been used or proposed for the calibration of the Wente condenser transmitter. The methods falling under the two classifications conveniently designated “constant pressure” or “pressure” calibration and “constant field” or “field” calibration are most useful and amenable to measurement. Which of these two calibrations is more significant depends on the particular use made of the transmitter. In the following pages the methods now used or proposed are reviewed and the advantages or disadvantages of each from the standpoint of transmitter application are discussed."
"This paper discusses the rating of the transmission performance of telephone circuits on the basis of the rate of repetitions in telephone conversations and presents the rating method set up on this basis, which is being adopted in the Bell System for determining and expressing the data for the transmission design of the telephone plant."
"Gutta percha and balata have proven eminently suitable for the insulation of long deep sea telegraph cables, but their dielectric losses are too high to meet the requirements of submarine telephone cables designed to operate over long distances or of shorter cables employing carrier currents. This paper describes a new material called paragutta which has been developed to meet the present needs. It consists essentially of the purified hydrocarbons of balata (or gutta percha) and of rubber together with minor quantities of waxes to modify the mechanical characteristics. The purification of rubber particularly with respect to nitrogenous constituents is necessary to effect electrical stability in water. A commercially usable method of purifying rubber is described. Evidence is furnished that paragutta has all of the desirable thermoplastic and mechanical properties of gutta percha while possessing such superior insulation characteristics as to make it suitable for use on long cables designed for transoceanic telephony. Its use is also advantageous on shorter deep sea cables designed for carrier telephony as well as for ocean telegraphs."
"An Efficient Loud Speaker at the Higher Audible Frequencies1 L. G. Bostwick. This paper describes a loud speaker designed for use as an adjunct to existing types for the purpose of extending the range of efficient performance to 11,000 or 12,000 cycles. A moving coil piston diaphragm structure is used in conjunction with a 2000-cycle cutoff exponential horn having a mouth diameter of about 2 inches. Motional impedance measurements on this loud speaker indicate an average absolute efficiency of about 20 per cent within the frequency range from 3000 to 11,000 cycles. The variation in response within this band does not exceed 5 db. By using a high-frequency loud speaker of this type the efficiency and power capacity of the associated low-frequency loud speaker can be improved and a uniform response-frequency curve from 50 to 12,000 cycles can be obtained."

"By means of microphone concentrators high quality sound pickup is rendered possible at distances of the order of 20–40 feet. One such device utilizes a metal horn with the microphone placed at the throat. In another form, applied commercially by RKO Studios, sound is picked up by an ellipsoidal or parabolic reflector and focused on a microphone, with the sensitive face of the transmitter turned away from the action. The advantages of this type of concentrator are relatively high gain, ability to record against wind or noise interference, and suitable acoustic characteristics for high quality pickup at a distance. The importance of these factors in lowering moving picture production costs is described."
"Inasmuch as the common methods of measuring motion picture screen reflection factors fail to bring out the essential differences between metallic and beaded screens, and fail to correctly describe the diffusing screen, a modified test procedure is suggested. This involves brightness measurements in two planes mutually perpendicular and perpendicular to the screen on which the incident beam is inclined at some suitable angle above the screen axis. Such a modification of test procedure permits the accurate analysis of a screen in terms of its suitability for a particular theater. — Tests of screen color are also recommended whereby the screen surface color and the color of the light source may be brought into closer coördination."
"Dubbing is essentially a re-recording process and has three important applications. The first is the re-recording of a completed feature from one form to another, as from film to disk, for release purposes. The second is the re-recording of the dialog, for the purpose of mixing in with it, sound effects or incidental music which, for technical or economic reasons, could not have been put in during the original recording. The third application is the synchronizing of foreign voices to a picture which was originally recorded in English. This last is a “doubling” rather than a dubbing process."
"It is suggested that the most promising line of development of the three-color camera will involve use of three films sensitized primarily for light of different colors, and that a lens of 50 mm. focus and f/2 speed will be used in connection with twin revolving bladed mirrors for splitting the light from the lens. The requirement of the positive print will be met by means of a transparent dye mordant that will at least retain the size and outlines of the negative grain to produce the necessary definition."
"A motion picture image with green shadows and blue halftones can be prepared by toning the image blue in the usual toning solution, fixing in hypo, washing, and then re-toning followed by immersion in a solution of a basic dye. In this way the first toning bath converts the silver image to a mixture of Prussian blue and silver ferrocyanide, the reaction going to completion in the halftones but incompletely in the shadows so that some of the silver is unaffected. The silver ferrocyanide is removed in the hypo solution leaving an image consisting of pure Prussian blue in the halftones and a mixture of this substance and silver in the shadows. On re-immersion in the blue toning bath, the silver in the shadows is again converted to a mixture of Prussian blue and silver ferrocyanide which latter substance is a mordant for basic dyes, so that on immersion in a dye solution the dye is absorbed only to the shadows."
"The arc length-arc voltage relations of the high intensity arc depend very largely upon the relative positions of the positive and negative carbons. There is a very definite point at which the light is a maximum and the point of maximum light is not the point of maximum steadiness."
"In this paper the 16 mm. home talkie situation is considered from the viewpoint of the amateur. The nature and interests of present users of 16 mm. apparatus are discussed. It is concluded that only a modest distribution of sound equipment among the amateurs will be realized, and that widespread use of this equipment will be found in a new group looking more for a source of entertainment than for a hobby. Available 16 mm. sound apparatus and subject matter are described. An estimate of possible developments in apparatus and appropriate subjects is given. There is also a discussion of the amateur's requirements in regard to sound apparatus from the technical viewpoint."
"President Crabtree: In order to give everyone an opportunity to air his views on the possible methods of securing a large screen picture, we reserved a place on this program for an open discussion on the subject. As Professor Hardy pointed out, if the photographic emulsion were absolutely grainless, if it were sufficiently fast, if it were so hard that it could not be scratched, and that it would not accumulate dirt, then wide film would not be necessary. Enough light could then pass through the film to ensure a reasonably large screen picture."
"The first part of the paper is mainly historical, tracing the development of the motion picture art, particularly from the French poim of view. Various processes used for synchronizing sound and picture from about 1899 to the present are mentioned. Among these processes are those employing engravings on the film, and reliefs which act to vary the capacity in a high-frequency circuit. Reference is also made to magnetic wire processes and finally, the present-day method of recording sound photographically. Two variations of the latter process, viz., the fixed density method and the variable density method are explained. The discussion continues with various types of light valve recorders and sources of light. — The second part of the paper deals with the particular processes now employed in France, discussing particularly the various mechanical, electrical, optical, and acoustical processes which intervene between the studio and the review room. The matter of acoustics of the studio and the effect on the sound record is discussed at some length, as well as the effect of speed changes in the driving motor of the camera or recorder. Various other apparatus used in the studios are described."
"According to this writer the new factor in the talkies is sound for its own sake and not speech, speech having found its place long ago in the printed captions of silent films. Study of these old subtitles, it is said, quickly defines screen dialog, while pure sound, no longer confused with spoken words, becomes a great artistic force. It was explained when presented, that this paper was really a chapter in “The Talkies,” an immediately forthcoming book. Its appearance here is with the express permission of the author and of the publishers, Henry Holt & Company, of New York."
"Impurities in the water supply are classified as follows: Dissolved salts, suspended matter, dissolved extracts, dissolved gases. The action of each impurity on development, fixation, and washing of films is treated. Methods of purifying water include distilling, boiling, filtering, and chemical treatment. Sea water, although not seriously harmful, should not be used excepting in an emergency. It is concluded that impurities in the water supply are not responsible for as many troubles as is usually supposed."
"In the last ten years there has been developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories a new technic of high-power micrography, which has greatly extended the limits of useful magnification possible with a microscope. Since any extension of the limits of magnification of he microscope which is accompanied by a decrease in definition is useless, it was found necessary to increase the resolving power or definition of the microscope. One way in which this can be done is by decreasing the wavelength of the light used. — A microscope using ultra-violet light was developed about thirty years ago by Koehler of the Zeiss works. Due to various difficulties in operating it, this microscope soon became a scientific curiosity and was almost forgotten. About five years ago, a microscope of this type was obtained from the Zeiss works by Bell Laboratories, and the difficulties involved in the use of this instrument were largely solved by the development of a mechanical method of focusing. With this microscope, it is possible to obtain crisp, brilliant images of metallurgical specimens magnified 5000 to 6000 diameters. In studying the advantages and limitations of this microscope, it was found to be particularly applicable to the study of biological and medical specimens. Such specimens can be examined at high magnification under the ultra-violet microscope without the necessity of cutting, staining, or injuring them in any way."
"The purpose of this paper is to set forth the various phases of the application of motion pictures as visual aids in teaching. It is pointed out that concrete experiences are a necessary prerequisite to the use of language and that educators, recognizing the prevalence of verbalism in schoolroom practice, are demanding materials, devices, and methods to correct this weakness. Visual aids, properly used, equip a group with a common body of life experiences, useful as a basis of growth in knowledge. — [By way of introduction to the paper, Mr. Baer presented three short film subjects of Eastman Teaching Films, having the titles Induced Currents, Energy from Sunlight, and Food and Growth. These films were presented in order to illustrate the subject matter used in films intended as visual aids in classroom instruction.—Editor.]"
"This paper describes a system for high quality sound reproduction from film in synchronism with the showing of motion pictures in theaters having a seating capacity of 1200 or less. A sound reproducing attachment is mounted upon each standard picture projector and is belt-driven by a common motor unit. The sound reproducing attachment houses a photo-electric cell which converts a light beam intercepted by the film sound track into electrical energy. Suitable preliminary amplifiers mounted upon independent pedestals amplify the output voice frequency energy of the photo-electric cell to a level suitable for further amplification by the main amplifiers. A control cabinet provides for switching and attenuating the sound circuits before being led to the main amplifiers and thence to the loudspeakers."
"The writer points out that by using a smaller number of reproducing units, fewer technical difficulties are involved in sound installations. With this in mind, a super-electrodynamic speaker has been designed, paying proper attention to the following requirements: (1) high air-gap flux density, (2) size of voice coil, (3) material and design of magnetic circuit, (4) design of air-gap face to provide large uniform air-gap density, (5) small leakage flux. The acoustical coupling between the loudspeaker and the auditorium which it is to serve must be considered in installing sound equipment, and is a matter upon which the success of the installation finally depends."
"President Crabtree: The matter of obtaining a wide screen picture and better sound reproduction should be freely discussed by our members. To what extent would putting the sound and picture on separate films contribute to these ends? There is no question that the quality of sound reproduction must be considerably improved, especially that of music, if the public is to remain interested very much longer. The reproduction of speech, I think, is quite good, but the quality of music is very poor, in my estimation."
"Four adaptations of the comparison microscope are described. One is an instrument for comparing two ¾ × 1 in. pictures. Another is a sound track photometer. The third is an instrument for measuring graininess, and the fourth is for checking film dimensions. The principles of application and methods of use are described."
"The Stereoscope is nearly a century old. Stereoscopic photographs were made almost simultaneously with the first practical photographic pictures, and stereoscopic projection devices for still pictures have been known for over seventy years. Motion pictures in relief, when viewed through red and green filters, one for each eye, have been shown too often to be now a novelty. — Fundamentally, stereoscopic vision requires that two eyes, related physiologically and psychologically, each view separately distinctly different pictures. Unless the taking, printing, projecting, and viewing of pictures are all done in such a way as to prevent the left eye from seeing what the right eye sees, there is no license to characterize the system as stereoscopic. This paper discusses several available methods for independent left and right eye vision."
"Mr. La Porte: During the past ten months we have been engaged in the development of apparatus for taking, processing, and exhibiting of pictures. We have used up to this time the 65 mm. width, not because that width is the only width, nor that we should not consider changing it, but for reasons which are of particularinterest. We had previously worked with a width of 56 mm. That width was chosen on the basis of the present 35 mm. height using standard perforations and doubling the width in order to make the width-to-height ratio equal to two to one."
"Although a simple process of color photography yielding a print which faithfully reproduces the colors of nature is greatly needed, most of the research at the present time is being directed to the perfection of color motion pictures. Another equally important field is the use of color photography in photomechanical printing processes, as colored illustrations have come into very extensive use during the past fifteen years. The work of different investigators may naturally be divided into (1) still photography, including color photographs to be viewed by transmitted light and by reflected light, and (2) motion picture color photography. — Almost from the first years in which motion pictures were used commercially, about 1895 to 1900, experimenters have been working on methods of producing them in natural colors. The only practical processes enjoying any extensive commercial use in the theaters, however, are subtractive processes in which the color is incorporated in the film. These subtractive processes, however, are only two-color methods and therefore a true spectral record is not realized. — One additive process has had extensive application for amateur motion pictures for over two years. Within the past year a large number of color motion pictures have been released with sound accompaniment so that the ultimate is being approached in motion picture photography, namely, pictures in color and sound."
"The development of sound motion pictures, utilizing electrical reproduction of sound, has caused a convergence of the technic of radio broadcast transmission and reception and the technic of the sound motion picture studio and theater. The approaching advent of home sound motion pictures and television broadcasting may be expected to bring the engineering methods still closer together. — Paralleling this engineering approach, there are indications of a similar and coöperative integration of the corresponding industries. The establishment of a great entertainment center in New York City, based on this evolutionary plan, is described in the paper. In this “Entertainment City” are to be combined radio broadcasting studios, recording facilities, auditoriums, executive offices of corresponding entertainment enterprises, and a group of large theaters and concert halls of various types."
"President Crabtree: Our Society chose to convene in New York City this fall with the deliberate object in view of effecting a closer relationship between ourselves and those who are producing motion pictures. New York City is destined to become increasingly important as a production center and it is to the interest of our members to become as fully acquainted as possible with the problems of the producers. On the other hand, it is to the interest of the producer that he keep abreast of the achievements of the scientists and technicians, who, in the first place, made motion pictures possible, who made the shadows talk, and upon whom the industry will have to rely to an increasing extent to feed the insatiable appetite of the public for something different in entertainment."
"This paper describes improvements made in the RCA Photophone Portable Recorder since the publication of the original paper describing this equipment. The new optical system and galvanometer, which require much less power for its operation, are described and illustrated. The new amplifier, considerably smaller and lighter than the previous one, is also described. Illustrations and electrical characteristics are given. This recorder is mounted upon a standard Mitchell camera and records by the Photophone variable-area method. The complete equipment weighs 450 pounds, including carrying cases and all accessories."
"Recently there has been provided among the research facilities of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., a separate building which is intended solely for sound picture research and development work. The prime objects of the laboratory are to find out the best methods and technic for employing sound picture recording and reproducing apparatus now in use, and of making improvements in recording and reproduction. The building contains a recording studio, film processing plant, and review room, together with testing laboratories."
"An analysis is made of the factors governing the apparent depth of field in a picture as judged by a person seated in the audience. The greatest depth of field results, for the same final magnification on the screen, when the focal length of both the camera and projector lenses are kept as short as possible. This procedure results in a greater magnification in projection, and the graininess of the film begins to be apparent if the process is carried too far. Actually the limit of magnification with 35 mm. film has been nearly reached with existing materials. — It is shown in this paper that the use of a wider film for both negative and positive does not alter the depth of field, provided the same over-all magnification is used. Similarly, making a large negative and a smaller print has no effect on the depth of field under comparable conditions."
"An experimental two-way television system in combination with a telephone service has been installed between two buildings in New York. With this system, two people can both see and talk to each other. It consists in principle of two complete television systems of the sort previously used for one-way transmission. Scanning is accomplished by the beam-scanning method using disks containing 72 holes. Purple light, to which the photo-electric cells used are quite sensitive, is employed for scanning, and a yellow-green light is used for illuminating the television booth. High-intensity neon lamps are used with a condenser lens disk at the receiving end to give an image brilliant enough to be seen without interference from the scanning beam. A frequency band 40,000 cycles wide is required for each of the two television circuits. Synchronization is effected by a 1275 cycle alternating current, controlling synchronous motors rotated 18 times per second. Speech is transmitted by microphones and loud speakers concealed in the television booths so that no telephone instrument interferes with the view of the face."
"Experience in acoustic diagnosis by application of Sabine's formula indicates the need of more comparative data for the solution of acoustical problems in theaters. For this purpose, the acoustical truck described in this paper was developed. The various uses of the truck and apparatus housed by it in studying reverberation, distortion, and transients, frequency characteristics, etc., of theaters are described. Oscillograms obtained in a number of such tests are presented."
"An illustrated description is given of some new input equipment for sound recording. This equipment provides for mixing the audio outputs of four or eight microphones into the recording amplifier, which has two output channels. Some of the interesting features of this equipment are: (a) Constant impedance mixing, providing constant load on each microphone amplifier for all combinations of volume control settings, thus giving unchanging fidelity and a constant output level from each microphone channel for all combinations of volume control settings in the other channels: (b) Filter for eliminating low rumbles, caused by room vibrations, wind disturbances, etc., can be switched “on” or “off” at the mixer. This filter does not affect the fidelity above 100 cycles. (c) Recording amplifier, having two output channels, supplying two loads with no interaction between them. Each channel has a convenient switching arrangement for changing the output transformer ratio, making possible the operation of one, two, or three 500 ohm loads in parallel. (d) Each unit of the equipment is designed to mount on a standard relay rack or in an individual box equipped with handles for carrying."
"An analysis is made of the factors which affect the choice of materials to be used for the construction of various types of processing apparatus. Three general classes of material are considered, namely: (1) metals, (2) coated metals, and (3) non-metallic materials. In addition to the direct action of solutions on metals, the possibility of electrolytic corrosion effects must be recognized. The results of an exhaustive series of tests on the effect of photographic solutions on single metals and metallic couples are summarized, including the effect of the materials on the solutions. — Practical recommendations are given regarding materials suitable for the construction of apparatus such as processing machines."
"From available data on the acuity of hearing of various groups of people, a chart is constructed showing the estimated distribution of any large group according to their hearing ability. Articulation vs. loudness curves are used to determine the amount of aid possible for any particular degree of deafness. From these sources it is estimated that approximately 10 per cent of the population who now cannot hear sound pictures satisfactorily can, with benefit, use a theater-hearing-aid system which reproduces without distortion; this number is reduced correspondingly with the amount of distortion introduced. The requirements of such a system are outlined and the Western Electric theater-hearing-aid attachment is described in detail."
"In connection with the installation, operation, and repair of amplifier equipment as used in the motion picture industry, various electrical measurements are necessary. In order to carry out these measurements, a portable test set was designed. This test set was arranged to measure the various voltages and currents encountered in amplifying equipment and in addition, means were provided for testing circuits, amplifier and rectifier tubes, and for measuring resistance and capacitance."
"An instrument for obtaining full-screen motion pictures of the vocal cords at the rate of 16 frames per second is described. A laryngoscope, illuminating system and viewing finder, are combined into a self-contained diagnostic unit. The problem of lighting is solved by using a quartz rod which directs the light from a small incandescent lamp to the larynx."
"Fundamental research and development work carried on with a particular objective in one field contributes in many cases to the solution of problems in other fields. A typical example is the application of the sound reproducing elements, developed for use primarily in sound picture theater reproducing systems, in the solution of an intricate problem in telephone system operation. This article outlines the communicating problem which was presented and describes the apparatus which was developed, employing adaptations of sound picture principles to meet the need."
"A loud speaker, designed for use as an adjunct to existing types of speakers to permit efficient sound radiation at the higher audible frequencies, is described. The structural and performance characteristics are indicated, and some of the advantages and limitations of such a loud speaker are discussed."
"If a television scanning disk is placed close to the ridged film in a Kodacolor projector, and three photoelectric cells are placed side by side in front of the projection lens, three sets of photoelectric signals will be produced, each corresponding to one of the primary colors. It is not necessary to use the color filters ordinarily placed before the lens or color-sensitive photoelectric cells, since the black and white strip images on the film contain the complete record of the characteristics of each colored image. The three sets of signals are transmitted over three communication channels and actuate a three-color receiving apparatus previously described."
"The principal features of the projectors described are primarily intended to avoid wear and injury to the film which occurs in non-continuous projectors. The wear is principally due to the tension applied to the perforation edges as the film is either forced down upon the sprocket teeth or pulled away from them. In one type of projector, the action of the feed and take-up sprockets is supplemented by that of driven friction rollers, which are designed to limit the pull on the perforation edges to a negligible fraction of its normal value. A more recent type of projector utilizes no sprockets at all, friction rollers with automatically regulated slippage taking their place. Loops in the film automatically regulate its pressure against the friction rollers, the size of these loops, and consequently the pressure, regulating the slippage."
"Supplementing a previous paper by Howard Greene published in 1926, the present paper describes further some of the applications of the time-lapse camera. The great value of this camera in conducting research of various kinds is pointed out, particularly with regard to work which is done in the laboratories of the United States Department of Agriculture."
"The causes of deterioration of film prints in use are pointed out and briefly discussed. Deterioration results largely from the drying out of the film, due to its protracted exposure to heat in the projectors. Various defects in the design of American projectors and their consequent contribution toward film deterioration are pointed out."
"The various subjects and types of subject matter included in educational films for classroom use together with the relation between these subjects and the value of films as aids to instruction are discussed. A series of films is being produced with the cooperation of the Department of Biology and Public Health of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and includes, in general, material dealing with hygiene and physiology, and the relation between these and disease prevention. The value of the films lies in the fact that a visual appreciation of a particular subject is generally much more vivid and lasting among children in the lower grades of school than the same material simply presented in words, especially when the visual presentation is supplemented by an oral presentation and discussion of the subject."
"Although the study of motion is not new, the application of the motion picture camera to this study provides an important tool by means of which the study is today being widely applied in industry. The purpose of motion study is to first record the actual motions involved in any particular industrial operation, second, to furnish a means for analyzing these motions; and third, to furnish an opportunity for eliminating or revising the motions so as to develop the one best way of accomplishing the desired results. The value to industry of such a study is pointed out, together with the fact that the application of the motion picture camera to such work may be quite an important by-product of motion picture engineering activities."
"The problem dealt with in this paper is that of finding how closely it is possible by the photographic process to produce a reproduction which will, when viewed, excite in the mind of the observer the same sensation as that resulting from the observation of the original. The treatment is divided into the main parts: the first dealing with the possibility of reproducing exactly the objective factors of the visual stimulus, and the second dealing with the subjective phase of the problem. A fairly complete system of terminology and symbols is developed in order to present more clearly the discussion, which necessarily deals with a large number of different factors. A graphic solution of the problem is given by means of which it is possible to determine quantitatively the departures from exact reproduction of both brightness and contrast in the finished print. This graphic solution is then extended to include the subjective phase and a final curve is obtained which indicates the extent to which reproduction of the subjective sensation is obtained. A practical application of the method is given, illustrating the results obtainable by the use of photographic materials, the sensitometric contrasts of which have been previously measured."
"In adapting existing theaters for sound reproduction, many factors have to be considered which it is the purpose of this paper to discuss. Among these factors are: the equipment which is chosen must be adequate for the particular theater involved; this equipment should be purchased from a reliable concern and properly installed, according to specifications; it is often better to completely rebuild a projection room than to crowd new and additional equipment into it; tests on fader settings for both film and disk records should be made at the time of installation, and periodically thereafter; a considerable amount of attention should be given to determining the acoustical characteristics of auditoriums prior to installing sound equipment, rather than at any time after it has been installed."
"An investigation into the work involved in sprint running is made by a method of cinematographic analysis. The runners are photographed as they pass behind a lattice which serves as a system of coördinance, the timing being accomplished by means of a series of dropping balls. As a result of this analysis, it has been possible to determine the amount of power required to accomplish the various component motions of the runner, and to separate these from the energy required to overcome gravity, wind resistance, and frictional contact with the ground."
"The ideal projector and its product, ideal projection, are defined in terms of the screen image. The particular characteristics which distinguish continuous non-intermittent projection are given. The apparent attitude of the motion picture industry toward improvements in projection and the reasons therefor are presented. Types of variable refraction projection systems are discussed with a view to pointing out the advantages possessed by the revolving lens wheel system. The single lens wheel system is described briefly. The main purpose of the paper is to dispel scepticism regarding the possibilities of non-intermittent projection and to clear the way for scientific investigation of the continuously illuminated non-periodic screen image."
"The first portion of this paper is a translation of an editorial in the November, 1930, issue of “Motion Pictures and Life” apparently an official organ of the Soviet motion picture industry. The Five- Year Plan of Soviet Russia embraces the development of the motion picture industry, and while most of the other industries fulfilled their assigned tasks during the first two years, the motion picture industry fell far behind. The weak points of the present system are outlined, and the general status of affairs is indicated. — The second portion of the paper is an abridgment of an article in “News of the Electric Industry,” of May, 1930, entitled “Talking Movies,” and describes apparatus developed by the Central Laboratory of Wire Communication in Moscow."
"Methods of accomplishing noise reduction are described, together with the factors influencing equipment design. An analysis of the circuit operation is provided. “Time constants” of the apparatus are discussed and a complete description, as well as photographs of the final commercial equipment now in use in studios, are included."
"The characteristics of the latest type of low intensity reflecting arc carbons (which are capable of burning at higher currents than those previously available) are presented. These include current capacity, candle-power, angular light distribution, crater diameter, and intrinsic brilliancy. — These characteristics are discussed in relation to the optical system. It is shown that although the maximum screen light from the present optical system as determined by photometric measurements can be obtained at a comparatively low current, there are decided practical advantages in using a higher current and larger carbons than the minimum theoretically possible. — It is also demonstrated that the faster projection lenses now available, together with a change in the magnification of the reflector system, should make possible an increase of theoretically 75 per cent in screen light over that now available with the present system. This increased screen light will have the same uniformity, flexibility, and factor of safety as that now obtained, provided the correct carbons and currents are used."
"The ribbon microphone consists of a light metallic ribbon suspended in a magnetic field and freely accessible to air vibrations from both sides. The vibration of the ribbon due to an impressed sound wave leads to the induction of an emf. corresponding to the undulations of the incident sound wave. The ribbon is caused to move from its position of equilibrium by the difference in pressure existing between the two sides. In general, the ribbon is made light so that its motion corresponds to the motion of the air particles at very high frequencies. One of the important advantages of this type of microphone as compared with a pressure-operated microphone is that it possesses marked directional properties. This has decided advantages in sound motion picture work."
"The prism type of continuous projector has the advantage that plane reflectors can be very accurately matched and totally reflecting prisms of a rhomboidal cross-section have the rare and peculiar property of maintaining the projected image in the same vertical plane and of exactly the same size throughout their optically effective travel. These requirements are all indispensable in obtaining definition and flatness of field. The registration of the continuous projector depends upon the indexing of the prisms and uniform motions of prism-wheels and film. The optical advantages to be noted are a characteristic smoothness in the projection, a restful quality to the eyes, and a noticeable plasticity in the projected image."
"This paper describes the RCA-Photophone type PG-30 sound motion picture reproducing equipment, which requires no batteries or motor-generator sets for plate, filament, and bias voltages, for operation in theaters wired with the normal 105 to 125 volt, 50 to 60 cycle, a-c. power. This equipment, primarily designed for theaters having seating capacities for 1000 persons or less, operates with inaudible output hum under operating conditions, is economical of the space it occupies, is easily serviceable, has an over-all frequency characteristic anticipating future improvements in sound-on-film recordings, has sufficient undistorted power output for providing satisfactory distribution of sound in the type of theater for which it is designed, and has provision for the addition of a remotely operated volume control where desired."
"The possibility of using intense intermittent light for motion pictures and special photography is discussed. Physical limitations of sources of intermittent illumination are reviewed. The characteristics of the mercury-arc thyratron which give it advantages as an intermittent light source are enumerated, viz., (1) the light is photographically actinic; (2) the duration of a light flash can be made less than ten microseconds; (3) the light intensity is high; (4) the frequency of flash is easily and accurately controlled by means of a grid. An example of the use of intense intermittent light is given, showing how stroboscopic motion pictures of the angular transients of synchronous motors are taken."
"The first part of the paper discusses the general design of the Photoflash lamp, its operating characteristics, and the quality of its light. The second part deals with the design of reflectors for efficiently utilizing and directing the light. The manner in which the lamp is used, number of lamps necessary, and their placement are explained. The application of the Photoflash lamp to the motion picture industry is discussed briefly."
"This paper deals with the advantages of selective hand-coloring, as distinguished from more or less complete coloring and covers briefly the use of hand-coloring in educational, commercial, and theatrical pictures. Finally, a description is given of the equipment used for hand-coloring."
"This paper deals with problems bordering between the artistic subject of editing sound film and the technical fields of recording and re-recording. The topics discussed are: characteristics of effective sound recording; functions of re-recording; sound effects—analogy with special-process photography; equipment for re-recording; choice of sound tracks in editing; sound dissolves; common faults of re-recording; personnel and organization for re-recording and sound editing. The purpose of the paper is to show how sound engineering, re-recording, and editing must be closely coordinated to give the desired emotional and artistic effect in the finished picture."
"The paper briefly describes a method of treating positive and negative motion picture film for eliminating abrasions and scratches and improving its elasticity. There are two treatments: (a) the rejuvenation or regeneration process, by means of which worn and damaged negatives and positives are restored to good condition and (b) the impregnation-preservation process, by means of which new negatives and prints are given a longer life in service or in storage. The processes do not involve the use of lacquers or coatings, but depend upon the swelling and contraction of the film and the glazing of the surface in order to resist scratching and accumulation of surface dirt."
"Several serious fires in film exchanges early indicated the need of careful attention to methods of storing and handling motion picture film. Many tests were made to determine proper methods of storage. Film requires special consideration in storage and handling because of its low ignition temperature, rapidity of combustion, and capability of decomposing with little air, evolving poisonous, inflammable gases. Fundamental safety precautions include: elimination of means of starting fires, adequate provision for control of fire, minimizing quantity of film subject to one fire, and ample means of exit. More important provisions of Regulations of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, based on above considerations, are discussed."
"Brief comments are made upon the difficulty which motion picture directors and technicians experienced when color was first introduced into motion pictures. The importance of color in motion pictures and the progress that has been recently made in color processes are pointed out. Emphasis is laid upon the necessity for steady experimentation in color values and the use of good taste in the adaptation of color."
"A brief analysis is given of the way in which colors are reproduced using a two-color negative separation method. The Multicolor process, working on this principle, is briefly described. Details are given concerning the film used, camera requirements, exposure, development, printing, and coloring."
"This paper sets forth the manner in which the lay-out of the Multicolor Laboratory was made to provide efficient handling of all processing media, as well as film itself. A chart shows the flow of film through the various stages of handling and processing. Emphasis is laid upon the major precautions taken to protect all film, and particularly negatives, against damage of any sort at any point in the plant."
"English language pictures accompanied by adequate Spanish titles still find favor in the chief markets of Latin America. Latin-American audiences want box-office personalities and through Spanish editions of our fan magazines nearly all our stars have built up a strong following. In consequence, pictures presenting them are more popular than Spanish versions in which the players are unknown. — This does not mean that no Spanish language pictures should be presented. Great care should be taken in their preparation, however, and original subjects should be used of a type which have special appeal. Castilian Spanish, the language of the stage, should be used, unless the setting is in a Latin-American country where the actors would use the pronunciation and idioms peculiar to that country. None of the foregoing applies to Brazil, where the language is Portuguese. Here Spanish speaking pictures are not acceptable. — The tastes of the Latin-Americans run to films containing much display in clothes and furnishings. High society pictures and musicals are both popular. — While Latin-American revenues from film showings are not nearly as high as those received from Europe, the market is nevertheless well worth consideration. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico stand fourth, seventh, and eighth, respectively, in quantity of motion pictures imported from the United States. There are about 900 theaters wired and the number is rapidly increasing."
"A number of miscellaneous improvements in laboratory apparatus are described, which have for their object the elimination of spots, scratches, and unevenness of density in processed motion picture film. Modifications in developing room equipment include a vacuum cleaner for removing sludge from developers, a cooling coil for adjusting developer temperature, a new type of rack guide for a developer tank, a compact rack light lock, a waterproof and corrosion-resisting portable darkroom lamp, and some auxiliaries for the prevention of spots and contamination on film. — Improvements in printing room equipment include the addition of a flywheel to a continuous printer to eliminate unevenness in density due to variation in the motion of the film during exposure. Also, a light change has been equipped to control either of two lamps of different wattage giving in each case exposure values which have precisely equal relationships. — Some changes have been made in rewinding equipment which include the addition of a weighted roller to make more firmly wound rolls and a large portable winding core. The design of a standard disk rewind has been changed to facilitate removal of the wound roll. — A film storage cabinet has been designed for laboratory use which gives an increased degree of protection from fire and water, at the same time assisting in the convenient and orderly arrangement of the film."
"In November, 1886, Le Prince, an inventor and scientist living in New York, N. Y., applied for a U. S. patent covering a photographic camera which would expose successively a number of images of the same object or objects in motion and reproduce the same in the order of taking. Although the patent granted him on January 10, 1888 (U. S. Pat. 376,247), described a camera having sixteen lenses, it is shown that the original application specified “one or more lenses.” His British patent No. 423, accepted Nov. 16, 1888, provided for both a camera and projector with one lens as well as multiple lenses. Most of Le Prince's important work was done in England and France from 1887 to 1890 with a single-lens camera, at least two of which were built and used. Descriptions are included of these cameras as well as a multiple lens camera. Evidence is introduced concerning the design of the cameras, such as the use of the Maltese cross intermittent movement, and of the building of and demonstrations with a projector."
"This report of the Progress Committee covers the period October, 1930, to May, 1931. The important advances in the cinematographic art which are described are classified as follows: (1) Production, (2) Distribution, (3) Exhibition, (4) Applications of Motion Pictures, (5) Color Photography, (6) Amateur Cinematography, (7) Statistics, (8) Publications and New Books."
"Two new forms are presented for a motion picture theater, which is considered as a structure intended purely for motion picture exhibition under the best conditions. These forms affect the present floors: one is arrived at by reversing the slope of the orchestra floor, by raising the position of the screen, and by adjusting the seats to the new angle of vision; the other, by changing the horizontal angles of the seats in relation to the screen. The balcony pitch is also reduced, thus economically reducing the height of the structure and affording a more comfortable view of the screen. The plan adapts itself more readily to the enlarged screen than does the present type of theater and allows for improved projection and acoustics."
"A comparison is made of certain types of sound recording by the variable density method, assuming a light-modulation device which is itself free from distortion. These types are: (1) toe recording where only the toe of the H & D curve is used both for negative and for positive; (2) composite straight-line records where negative exposures are confined to the straight-line portion of the H & D curve, and in printing use is made of a portion of the positive toe, the over-all projected gamma being greater than unity; (3) straight-line recording where both negative and positive exposures are confined to their respective straight-line portions, and the over-all projected gamma equals unity. — The analysis shows that, by observing certain requirements, distortionless sound records can be made on all three types. In signal volume the toe record is louder than the composite and the latter louder than the strict straight-line record. In ground noise the toe record is inferior to each of the other two. The signal-to-noise ratio is greatest for the record where only the straight lines are used and least for the toe record. — The application of noise reduction to these three records is discussed, and it is shown that, with the same freedom from distortion, a noise reduction of 6 db. may be attained in toe recording, 10 db. in the composite type, and 14 db. in the third type. — The fact is emphasized that the pictorial object is not necessarily identical with the acoustic, since pictorially useless toe recording is capable of acoustic excellence. — Sensitometric data are discussed, and it is pointed out that in computing the over-all gamma account must be taken of the ratio of negative printing density to negative visual diffuse density, and of the ratio of projected print density to visual diffuse print density, as well as the distinction between intensity scale and time scale sensitometers."
"A system for reducing ground noise on variable area records was described by Townsend, McDowell, and Clark in February, 1931. The preferred method employs a shutter mounted on the recorder which intercepts part of the light and reduces the sound track to a width just sufficient at all times to accommodate, the modulation. A commercial design of shutter has been developed for this system. — A motor for actuating the shutter has been designed in which an iron armature moves in a direction parallel to the pole faces so as to change the areas rather than the lengths of the air gaps. Such a motor combines the special advantages of the moving coil type, namely, long throw and stability, permitting the use of a highly flexible spring, and the advantages of the iron armature type, namely, light field structure and large winding space. Electromagnetic damping is provided. The resulting motor gives full deflection on about 20 milliamperes and has the desired speed of action. It can be attached to the optical system of the RCA Photophone type PR-4 Recorder with no operations on the latter except drilling and tapping two screw holes."
"This paper describes a simple cine-photomicrographic apparatus built for the Bio-Cinema Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The essential feature of the apparatus is an optical system which permits the separation of the microscope and illuminating system from the camera and its driving mechanism. The microscopist is thus enabled to use the microscope in the ordinary manner for visual work and has merely to insert the unit under the camera when the subject is ready to be photographed. In this way the same camera can be used interchangeably with a number of microscopes."
"Curves, photomicrographs, and spectrograms are presented and discussed showing sensitometric tests both with incandescent white light and with colored lights, rate of development characteristics, and color sensitivity and graininess for both du Pont special and du Pont regular panchromatic negatives."
"This paper describes two old and much used color processes. In both of these the colors are applied as tints to the black-and-white prints. Hand-schiegl used the imbibition method and Pathéchrome the stencil system. Both systems have been used to produce release prints in commercial quantities."
"The application of sound picture technic toward the solution of solar eclipse problems is described. Motion pictures of the shadow spot cast upon the earth by the moon during an eclipse are taken simultaneously with photographic records of time signals broadcast by radio. By coördinating the information contained in these photographic records of the shadow spot, the time signals, and identification marks on the earth, sufficient information is available for solving various astronomical problems such as determining with greater accuracy the distance of the moon from the earth, the relative positions of earth, moon, and sun, and to permit more accurate computation and prediction of eclipses. A method is also described of making a qualitative study of the variation of light intensity at points in the path of the shadow."
"Due to its length, Mr. Jones' paper on sensitometry which was presented in part on three consecutive days at the Spring, 1931, Meeting of the Society at Hollywood, Calif., will likewise be published in the Journal in three consecutive issues. The following is the first of the three installments. The paper deals in a tutorial manner with the general subject of sensitometry, its theory and practice."
"This instrument is one giving a time scale of exposure. The exposure scale consists of 21 steps in which the exposure increases by consecutive powers of √2. The modulation of exposure time is accomplished by means of a sectored drum driven by a synchronous motor. Two standardized electric incandescent lamps are provided, one for use in exposing negative materials and one for positive materials. These are mounted in pre-positioned bases, the lamp itself being permanently set in position at the factory so that when the base is placed on its support by means of two dowel pins the filament of the lamp must lie upon the optical axis of the instrument and in register with the distance indicating scale. Standardized dyed gelatin filters are provided so that for positive materials the exposure illumination has a color temperature of approximately 3000°K., while for negative materials the color temperature is approximately 5400°K., approximately matching mean noon sunlight in quality. Electrical measuring instruments for controlling the standard lamps are an integral part of the sensitometer. Convenient guides for positioning the film to be exposed are provided as well as a roll holder for carrying a supply of raw stock. It is estimated that the probable error in exposure does not exceed ± 2.5 per cent."
"The advantages which the new supersensitive film has over the present type of film are described, and comparative photographic characteristics of the two types of film are presented. In addition, the paper includes a brief discussion of the particular features involved in the use of the faster film, such as the difference in color sensitivity of the two types, and relative contrast, and the rendering of details in shadows and soft highlights. Users of the new film are cautioned against the danger of processing it when using the present safe lights, on account of the greater speed of the emulsion. The paper concludes with a description of the gray base which has been provided, mainly for the purpose of avoiding halation."
"It has long been known that commercial fixing solutions containing hypo, sulfurous acid, and silver bromide can be electrolyzed between inert electrodes by very small currents. Attempts to increase the current density to practical amounts have caused discoloration of the hypo, ruining its utility. It has been found that suitable adjustment of the acidity and the sulfite content of the solution, combined with extremely rapid agitation, enables the silver to be plated at current densities varying from 2 to 10 amperes per square fool. Plating cells have been built comprising alternating elements of graphite anodes and stainless steel cathodes, 4 feet square, each presenting a total active surface of about 7 square feet. Thirteen pairs are used in a paraffined wood tank through the ends of which a stout stainless steel shaft is fastened. The shaft is covered with hard rubber and is furnished with spokes or paddles which rotate, four in number, in the spaces between the plates. Special water protected bearings have been developed to isolate the naked metal from the hypo solution at the gaskets on the box ends before the shaft meets the true suspension bearings. — Five cells capable of handling 150 million feet of mixed positive and negative 35-mm. film each year have been installed in the new laboratory erected by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at Culver City. A smaller installation of 3 cells is near completion at the Universal Studios, Hollywood. Further details of the erection and working of these plants will be published in a later paper."
"In using the system for electrolytically regenerating fixing baths described elsewhere in this issue of the Journal, it is evident that a very exact relation must subsist between the quantity of film fixed and the current supplied for electrolysis. If the current decreases the solution will become overburdened; if the current is too great decomposition will occur owing to lack of silver for plating. A monitoring system has been developed in which the solution is analyzed periodically by an optical titrating device. Measured quantities of the fixing solution and sodium sulfide are mixed, forming a brown suspension which is inspected by a standard lamp and a nickel wire bolometer. The indication is interpreted by a master relay which actuates a motor-operated field control on the plating dynamo. While the monitor works efficiently, it has been found that the lag in increase or diminution of silver in large processing plants is so great that hand adjustments, made after casual inspection two or three times a day secure sufficiently accurate plating. The automatic shows its greatest utility in shutting down the apparatus at night when there is no personal attention available."
"A general description of the function of air conditioning apparatus in the modern film laboratory. A brief history of the development of this type of equipment, from the old rack-and-tank method of developing to the present highly developed machine methods is followed by an outline of the type and application of equipment used in the various phases connected with the progress of the film through the laboratory. Elimination of dust, accurate control of drying schedules, accurate control of temperatures and humidities in the drying cabinets and wash rooms, accurate control of developing solutions all combine to make a finished product of the highest quality every day in the year regardless of outside atmospheric conditions. A brief description of the details of the equipment is given, accompanied by pictures."
"A new 35-mm. portable projector is described. The optical system consists of either the T-20, 900-watt or T-20, 1000-watt lamp, Bausch and Lomb Cinephor condensers, and the lens mounts are so constructed as to take full-size professional no. 2 or series II lenses. The projector is of the straight-through threading type. All the operating parts are directly connected to the motor, no belts being used. Framing is accomplished by the rotating-sprocket method. — A new type of sound gate without tension shoes forms part of the equipment. The revolving shutter is placed between the projection lamp and the aperture, and functions also as an automatic fire shutter. The equipment is entirely enclosed within its own case and weighs approximately 100 lbs."
"Among the pioneers who were engaged in developing the motion picture art, the name of Eugene Augustin Lauste prominently appears. In the January, 1931, issue of the Journal a brief outline of Mr. Lauste's career was presented by the Historical Committee of the Society. This paper deals more intimately with the various stages of Mr. Lauste's career, particularly with regard to his long-continued experimentation with various methods of recording and reproducing sound on film. A replica of one of Mr. Lauste's original sound picture recording and reproducing machines was exhibited at the Spring, 1931, Meeting of the Society at Hollywood."
"This paper describes structural changes made in light valves with the object of improving their quality, stability of operation, and efficiency, the most important being the introduction of damping to off-set resonance. These features are chiefly considered from the standpoint of production requirements and engineering economies. The shapes of the exposure waves for the two outstanding types (single and double ribbon) are considered. A new type of oscillograph (synchronous slit type) is described. This oscillograph permits the behavior of the valve to be observed at any frequency within the recording range."
"In sound picture production, the process of making the release print negative for sound requires the reproduction of the existing positive sound record in order that it may be recorded in proper continuity and corrected for volume level. The machine used for this purpose is called a “re-recording machine.” — This paper describes a new re-recording machine recently made available which is suitable for use in studios using either the variable density or variable width method of recording sound. The machine described employs a novel type of film aperture and a new method of focusing the sound lamp. To insure uniformity of film movement and to eliminate unwanted noises in the re-recording process, the workmanship must be of the highest order. Some of the requirements and testing methods employed in the manufacture of the machine are discussed."
"Motion picture screens contribute very materially toward the success of a picture. A poorly selected or poorly used screen will detract considerably from pictures on which huge sums of money are spent. A good screen surface costs little, but its importance is beyond all comparison with its cost. This paper deals with the selection and use of screens for assuring good projected pictures."
"The use of portable and semi-portable sound recording equipment is gaining favor because these types provide much more flexible and economical arrangements than are possible with permanent installations. Some of the units are installed in trucks which can move from one location to the other with great facility. Other units employ portable monitors mounted on platforms which can be moved about the studio from stage to stage and are used in recording either with truck or permanent installations. The paper briefly discusses the advantages of the portable type of equipment."
"This paper briefly discusses the need for standardization of the picture aperture of cameras and of camera motors. It is pointed out that great disadvantages arise through the use of freak or un-standard equipment, particularly with regard to the great variety of blimps now in use. The paper points out the necessity for standardizing the width of film and the width to height ratio of the picture, and for continually acquainting the cameraman in simple language with current progress in the art with relation to matters which involve the camera."
"Due to the great variation in blimps or camera covers, it is impossible to standardize on auxiliary camera view-finders. At the present time these finders are so arranged that the finder picture coincides with the photographed picture in but one plane, so that the cameraman cannot depend on the finder picture for photographing the desired view. Several remedial suggestions are made in this paper, and the great expense caused by the lack of well-designed view-finders is briefly discussed."
"This paper deals primarily with the need for improving the design of cameras and camera accessories. Existing photographic equipment is reviewed and the inefficiency of blimps and camera covers is stressed. The remedy for the situation evidently lies in the standardization of motors and the adoption of silent movement cameras. The paper closes with a summary of views on the matter by leading first-cameramen of the industry, and suggestions for changes in existing accessories, to be embodied in cameras for the future."
"A historical introduction, outlining the various stages of development of motion picture photography; progress in the manufacture of materials; innovations in technic; changes in the design of equipment, lighting systems, etc. The present school of photography is facing a most unsatisfactory period, with its excessive amount of interior work and elaboration; the art is developing too rapidly to permit cinematographers to thoroughly master it. Great restraints are placed upon the cameraman by the recording of sound, and the camera covers are a serious handicap to his artistry. The supersensitive film gives promise of an era of better photography, permitting improvements in exposures and lighting system The use of filters is but imperfectly understood by the cameraman; and motors, apertures, etc., must be standardized before any considerable improvements in camera design can be realized. The need for photometric devices and other scientific measuring instruments is emphasized, the lack of such facilities causing a degeneration of the photographic art to a system of guesswork."
"An innovation at the Spring, 1931, Meeting of the Society at Hollywood, Calif., was an exhibition of new apparatus held in the annex of the American Legion Auditorium. The exhibit aroused such great interest that it is hoped to hold similar exhibits at future conventions. — Exhibitors were required to conform to the following regulations: (a) It was necessary that the apparatus be new or have been developed or improved within the previous twelve months; (b) No pamphlets or advertising literature were permitted; (c) Each exhibitor was permitted to display a small card giving the name of the manufacturing concern and each piece of equipment was labeled with a plain label free of the name of the manufacturer; (d) A technical expert capable of describing the features of the apparatus exhibited was required to be present during the period of the exhibition."
"Due to its length, Mr. Jones' paper on sensitometry which was presented in part on three consecutive days at the Spring, 1931, Meeting of the Society at Hollywood, Calif., will likewise be published in the Journal in three issues. The following is the second of the three installments. The paper deals in a tutorial manner with the general subject of sensitometry, its theory and practice. The third installment will be published in the January, 1932, issue of the Journal."
"The paper includes a description of the general principles of the Dunning process and methods of processing backgrounds into motion pictures. It elaborates on a previous paper1 describing the system. Various features to be considered in applying the process and the various difficulties encountered are briefly discussed. The necessity for maintaining the proper height and angle of the camera when taking shots of backgrounds to be processed is emphasized."
"This paper deals with the dependence of the quality of variable width recording on the conditions of exposure and development. When the widths of the images employed in recording or reproducing are comparable with the wavelength of the record the exposed portion of the record is not uniformly exposed. The record is attenuated in amplitude as the frequency is increased, and harmonics are introduced whose relative intensities depend on the contrast of development and on the frequency. When the exposure of the record occupies the linear range of the H & D curve, and when the product of the gammas of the negative and the positive is equal to unity, the record is practically free from spurious harmonics. The amount of non-linear distortion is calculated for the case when the over-all gamma is equal to two; and it is shown that Cook's2 analysis of the aperture effect gives a superior limit to the distortion obtainable by overexposure or by over- or underdevelopment. The effect of the unavoidable non-uniform illumination of the images is considered."
"The photographic treatment of variable width films is a subject of much interest to those who are concerned with the problem of obtaining the maximum high frequency response from a given type of film. An experimental study of the effect of photographic treatment upon the 6000-cycle output from Eastman positive film has been made. The results of this study show how the 6000-cycle output of a print varies with the density and gamma of the negative and the print. The variation in negative output with density and gamma is also shown. Under optimum printing conditions the output of a 6000-cycle contact print (made on the frame printer) is 92 per cent of that obtained from the best negative."
"Methods of using sensitometric data in processing variable width sound records in film laboratories are described and the great importance of these records as contributing to a successful product is stressed. These data include density exposure curves, time gamma curves, etc. The method of applying the data for determining the time of development is described. The relation between the required exposing lamp current and the gamma is discussed."
"The use of new filters known as the “3N5” and “5N5” in making exposure shots with supersensitive film is described. The need for such filters is shown to be made necessary by the nature of the color sensitivity of the supersensitive film. The effect of these filters on the required exposure time, lens aperture, or illumination incident upon the object being photographed is discussed in relation to the filter factors of the new filters. The paper concludes by outlining a simple method of applying the numerical value of the filter factors to particular cases."
"The function of motion picture sets is to create the proper atmosphere for the action and to establish in the viewer's mind a mood which is characteristic of the scene. Sets are constructed of light-weight materials which are made to appear solid and real by means of technical processes. The technic of using miniatures has been very highly developed and the processes can be made to provide perfect photographic illusions of great height and depth. The paper briefly describes the manner of using these miniatures."
"The organization of a sound department is treated briefly. Equipment requirements such as standardization, simplicity of circuits, and special testing are discussed. To provide a general idea of the work necessary to maintain sound recording equipment, transmission and electrical maintenance are discussed, with comments based on past experience. General statements regarding records and reports showing their use as valuable tools in this work are included. The latter part of the paper deals with a large studio installation, indicating how the methods outlined are applied. Photographs and a few short narratives of actual problems that have occurred are used for illustration."
"An outline of the motion picture production problem is presented from the viewpoint of the technician. The details of picture making vary somewhat among the several studios but the general procedures and practices are essentially similar. For purposes of illustration a composite organization chart is shown and the functions of the several staff departments discussed. The operations of a typical production unit are described in some detail and a few examples of every-day problems and their solution are mentioned. All phases of the work are revised from time to time to take advantage of new methods and materials which may contribute to a better production job at lower cost."
"This paper describes some of the difficulties encountered in sending a motion picture company into a faraway country for the purpose of obtaining realism in production. It describes in detail the difficulties encountered in preparing the company for departure, and those experienced after arriving in the Malay States. The problems attending the sound and camera equipment, in transporting the exposed film to the laboratory in time to avoid deterioration, the experiences with the natives who had been engaged to supply “atmosphere” for the picture, the particular difficulties encountered in recording sound in inaccessible places, and a few more or less personal experiences of the technicians who accompanied the expedition, are all described."
"A revision of a previous glossary* prepared by the Committee on Standards and Nomenclature. The terms included in the following glossary are those which are in common use among motion picture engineers. Since motion picture engineering is essentially a combination of other well-recognized branches of engineering, such as electrical, chemical, illuminating, etc., it is to be expected that many of the terms used by motion picture engineers have already been standardized by other engineering societies. For this reason, the definitions approved by such societies as the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Institute of Radio Engineers, the Illuminating Engineering Society, etc., have been adhered to as closely as possible in the preparation of this glossary. In some cases, the definitions proposed by these societies have been included verbatim."
"This report of the Progress Committee covers the period May, 1931, to September, 1931. The important advances in the cinematographic art which are described are classified as follows: (1) Production, (2) Distribution, (3) Exhibition, (4) Applications of Motion Pictures, (5) Color Photography, (6) Amateur Cinematography, (7) Statistics, (8) Publications and New Books."
"This paper describes an improved machine for developing motion picture negative films in use at the laboratories of the Universal Pictures Corp. A thorough description of the machine and its operation is given. The system involves the so-called reversal process."
"The instrumental measurement of noise presents difficulties that have in the past generally defeated its successful accomplishment. While noise exists in a physical state and certain of its quantities are susceptible to direct measurement, the magnitude of a noise is evaluated through the interpretation of the human ear. The ear is non-linear in its evaluation of the various factors of noise. The degree and nature of the ear's non-linearity to the principal factors is discussed, with respect to the chief interpretative impression, that of loudness. — Audiometric measurements approached a more proper evaluation of noise, but in addition to dependency upon human judgment, were only approximate, and represented comparisons of physiological effects of noise rather than true noise values. — An instrument is described that measures intensity expressed in terms of loudness, evaluated for frequency and duration, and which combines portions of a complex waveshape in a suitable manner. The characteristics of the meter and the ear are compared. The readings are in decibels above a zero reference point near the threshold of audibility. The selection and meaning of this scale is explained. Where it is desired to analyze the pitch or frequency of a noise, an analyzer attachment permits either band or single-frequency analysis. Some limitations in its use in making noise measurements are discussed."
"A microphone is described which retains all of the inherent advantages of the moving coil type of structure, but unlike the earlier forms of this microphone it responds uniformly to a wide range of frequencies. It is more efficient than the conventional form of condenser microphone and its transmission characteristics are unaffected by the changes in temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. Unlike the condenser microphone, the moving coil microphone may be set up at a distance from the associated amplifier and efficient operation obtained. Owing to its higher efficiency and lower impedance it is less subject to interference from near-by circuits. It is of rugged construction, and when used in exposed positions is less subject to wind noise."
"An optical system which uses positive and negative cylindrical lenses with their axes at right angles is described. The image of a source is optically elongated and flattened by these cylindrical lenses to the proportions desired, and is then focused on the film. Advantages are: maximum possible brilliancy with a given source temperature; not sensitive to position of the lamp filament; sharpness of image; and intrinsically perfectly uniform brilliance throughout the length of the beam."
"The properties of a large number of known intensifying and reducing solutions have been studied in detail to determine formulas suitable for use with motion picture film. — For intensification, the chromium, Monckhoven (mercury), and silver intensifiers were the most satisfactory. The Monckhoven intensifier is useful for extreme intensification where permanence is not essential and the chromium intensifier is suitable for negatives where a medium increase in contrast is desirable. The degree of intensification with the chromium method may be controlled within limits by a variation of the time of redevelopment. For negatives and projection prints, intensification with silver has been found to give strictly neutral images and the process permits of easy control of the degree of intensification. So far as is known, both the chromium and silver intensified images are stable. — For subtractive reduction, such as in the case of overexposures or fogged images, the use of either (1) a two-bath formula comprising separate solutions of potassium ferricyanide and sodium thiosulfate, or (2) a modification of the Belitzski reducer is suitable. Where proportional reduction is required, a solution containing ferric ammonium sulfate with sulfuric acid is recommended. — It has been found that the above methods of intensification and reduction are applicable to sound film with the possible exception of subtractive reduction which, by virtue of the lowering of resolving power, causes a loss of high frequencies."
"At the close of the fifteenth fiscal year we find the Society placed on a firmer and more permanent foundation than at any other time in its history. The position of the Society in the world of motion pictures seems definitely assured, and its value as a stabilizing element among the necessarily volatile conditions peculiar to this industry is generally recognized."
