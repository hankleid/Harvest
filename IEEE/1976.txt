 "Performance of a monitor using a geometric moving-average (GMA) of observations of a system subject to sudden changes is related to parameters describing some aspects of the changes and to parameters of the monitor. Monitor parameters to optimize performance are determined numerically for an example of practical interest."
"Suppose that we have the distances top + 1targets obtained from a moving platform at discrete times with the (p+ 1)st target being a reference beacon. Assume that the distances are measured with an additive error which has a zero mean and that the errors are uncorrelated in time and space. Given the knowledge of the error structure, the position of the reference target, and the set of the successive simultaneous ranges, we present a statistical method for accurately determining the positions of the remaining targets in a computationally reasonable manner, assuming that the platform positions satisfy a certain constraint. Alternatively, reversing the roles of targets and observer, the method can be used to track a moving target platform using ranges simultaneously measured from p observers whose fixed positions are known, provided that there is a (p+ 1)st observer at a known position. As long as the target track is sufficiently variable, the discrete-time range data can be used to estimate the position of the p observers and the target track. In practice the method could be used to refine the location estimates of the observers based on successive simultaneous range measurements of the target while tracking the target. If {\\sl two} observer positions {sl are known}, {sl no constraint} has to be put on the target track. The technique is analyzed using several artificial data sets for one reference target (or observer). We show that when the error is small we obtain an accurate map of ten fixed targets from 500 platform locations, and the map is also reasonably accurate even when the mean error is 70 percent of the average true distance. We also analyze another model that has 14 targets observed from 1000 locations but where the location of two of these targets are known. In any of the scenerios, as the number of successive range measurements whose errors are uncorrelated grows to infinity, the coordinate estimates of the p target (observer) locations converges in probability to the true coordinates."
"The stochastic process at the output of a matched filter, when the latter is excited by its proper signal in additive white noise, has a mean function proportional to its covariance function. Sample path properties of a Gaussian process with the mean proportional to the covariance, conditioned such that it assumes a given value at the instant of the peak in the mean, are independent of signal amplitude. Formal and rigorous proofs and a detection-theoretical interpretation of this result are presented. It is then applied to the calculation of the detection probability of a rectangular signal of unknown time of arrival and to bounding the threshold effect in the estimation of the time of arrival. A novel passage time result is derived in the Appendix."

"An extensive study of binary triple-error-correcting codes of primitive lengthn = 2^{m} - 1is reported that results in a complete decoding algorithm whenever the maximum coset weightW_{max}is five. In this regard it is shown thatW_{max} = 5when four dividesm, and strong support is provided for the validity of the conjecture thatW_{max} = 5for allm. The coset weight distribution is determined exactly in some cases and bounded in others."
"The encoded sequences of an(n,k)convolutional code are treated as sequences of polynomials in the ring of polynomials moduloX^{n} - 1. Any such sequence can then be written as a power series in two variablesw(X,D), where the polynomial coefficient ofD^{j}is the \"word\" at time unitjin the sequence. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the ring \"multiplication\" for the set of such sequences so that the set becomes alinear associative algebra are derived. Cyclic convolutional codes (CCC's)are then defined to be left ideals in this algebra. A canonical decomposition of a CCC into minimal ideals is given which illuminates the cyclic structure. As an application of the ideas in the paper, a number of CCC's with large free distance are constructed."

"This paper considers the problem of efficient transmission of vector sources over a digital noiseless channel. It treats the problem of optimal allocation of the total number of available bits to the components of a memoryless stationary vector source with independent components. This allocation is applied to various encoding schemes, such as minimum mean-square error, sample-by-sample quantization, or entropy quantization. We also give the optimally decorrelating scheme for a source whose components are dependent and treat the problems of selecting the optimum characteristic of the encoding scheme such that the overall mean-squared error is minimized. Several examples of encoding schemes, including the ideal encoder that achieves the rated istortion bound, and of sources related to a practical problem are discussed."
"As the transmission rateRgets large, differential pulse-code modulation (PCM) when followed by entropy coding forms a source encoding system which performs within 1.53 dB of Shannon's rate distortion function which bounds the performance of any encoding system with a minimum mean-square error (mmse) fidelity criterion. This is true for any ergodic signal source. Furthermore, this source encoder introduces the same amount of uncertainty as the mmse encoder. The 1.53 dB difference between this encoder and the mmse encoder is perceptually so small that it would probably not be noticed by a human user of a high quality (signal-to-noise ratio(S/N) \\geq 30dB) speech or television source encoding system."
"The bandwidth compressor-expander developed by Gabor more than 25 years ago is reexamined. It is shown that the compressor or expander can be simulated by comb filtering followed by frequency translation of the tooth contents. With a proper choice of window function, the comb teeth do not overlap and no ambiguity is introduced by the coding process. When applied to television messages, with the line harmonics chosen as preferred frequencies, compression or expansion is best described as providing a line frequency standards conversion. The combined compression-expansion system gives a reduced transmission bandwidth at the expense of vertical resolution and provides a flexible technique for the two-dimensional smoothing of television pictures in which simultaneous control of vertical and horizontal resolution is possible. A sampled signal form of the compressor-expander can be realized in digital form by using shift registers as delay lines. The digital version permits simple control of the compression ratio and preferred frequencies."
"Most of the data compression strategies currently used for black/white (one-bit gray-scale) images involve the detection and noiseless encoding of a specified set of image features, the most common features being \"runs\" of adjacent equal.valued picture elements. A procedure is provided that, given the frequency distribution for a particular set of features in a sample of images, calculates an extended run-length code (ERLC) that includes two classes of codewords: \"regular\" codewords for the runs and \"special\" codewords for the other image features. An ERLC is shown to be highly efficient for the sample images, uniformly efficient for similar images not in the sample, and easily implemented. An encoder and the corresponding decoder are described which can implement any ERLC that includes up toRregular codewords andSspecial codewords, whereRandSare design parameters. Neither the encoder nor the decoder requires a table of codewords; rather, both are controlled by two auxiliary tables that include only\\ell_{max} [\\log_{2} R]-bit entries and\\ell_{max} [\\log_{2} S]-bit entries, respectively, where\\ell_{max}is the length of the longest codeword."
"Joint optimization of transmitter and receiver filters in a pulse-amplitude modulation (PALM) system with an arbitrary but fixed Viterbi detector is considered. Optimization is performed under an average transmitted power constraint with respect to a new criterion called the effective mean-square error (EMSE). It is shown that the optimization problem is convex. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is derived, and a method for optimization is proposed. Numerical results are obtained for a channel with coaxial cable characteristics."
 "This paper is concerned with two problems in the theory of source coding subject to a maximum average distortion constraint. The first problem involves the coding of a nonergodic discrete time source and the second involves coding for a class of ergodic discrete time sources. Coding theorems are given for both of these situations for very general source alphabets. The codes that are obtained here will, in general, be variable length codes so that average code rate and average distortion are the measures of performance."
"Nahi [2] considered the optimal linear estimation with uncertain observations. In his model, the binary random variables characterizing uncertainty of signals in the observation were statistically independent. This correspondence considers the same model but with the binary random variables correlated."
"The detection problem for the model \"signal-plus-noise,\" where the \"noise\" is represented by a Wiener process, has been approached primarily through the use of martingale theory. There are two core results: a new version of what is called \"Girsanov's theorem\" and the fact that the Wiener measure on the space of continuous functions can be generated by any Wiener process. In this correspondence a new version of \"Girsanov's theorem\" is derived and some fragmentary results concerning the measures associated with martingales are presented."
  "A realization of a linear sequential circuit is called a canonical convolutional encoder if its state space has the smallest dimension among all realizations generating the same code. We give conditions for a realization to be a canonical oncoder and for two canonical encoders to generate the same code. The techniques used provide an enumeration of canonical encoders whose realizations are not isomorphic."
"By using distance properties of convolutional codes, an upper bound on the back-up depth for maximum likelihood decoding is derived. Then several constraints for performing the back-up search are introduced which eliminate the necessity for many of the subsearches. Examples are given in each step to explain the approach."

"LetIbe the Riemann integral over [0,A] of a realization of a random processX(t)with stationary independent increments (SII), finite second moments, andX(0) = 0. The optimal design, consisting of n distinct observation times, for estimatingIrelative to a mean-squared error optimality criterion is shown to be the design such thatt_{i} = 2iA/(2n + 1), i = 1, \\cdots,n, independent of the parameters of the process. The mean-squared error of the optimal estimate is displayed. The optimal design for estimating the integral over a proper subinterval of [0,A] is also derived."
"This paper presents a new estimation scheme for the spectral density function of a stationary time series from observations taken at discrete instants of time. The sampling instants are determined by a Poisson point process on the positive real line. Under weak smoothness conditions on the spectral density, asymptotic expressions for the bias and Variance are derived, and it is shown that the estimate is mean-square consistent for all positive values of the average sampling rate. The new estimate compares favorably with the classical continuous-time spectral estimates."
"The autoregressive (AR) spectral estimator is used to make high resolution spectral estimates based on short data records. Measures of a frequency averaged normalized bias and normalized variance of the spectral estimates are introduced. A large number of spectra are generated. Based on the above mentioned measures and visual inspection of the estimates of the generated spectra, the AR and the conventional tapered and transformed (TT) spectral estimates are compared. It is shown that the AR spectral estimator is as stable as that given by its asymptotic variance. It is also shown that the AR spectral estimator is most powerful in estimating narrow spectral peaks with a high signal-to-interference ratio in the signal bandwidth."
"In this paper the connection between the self-information of a source letter from a finite alphabet and its code-word length in a Huffman code is investigated. Consider the set of all independent finite alphabet sources which contain a source letter a of probabilityp. The maximum over this set of the length of a Huffman codeword for a is determined. This maximum remains constant aspvaries between the reciprocal values of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. For the smallpthis maximum is approximately equal to\\left[ \\log_{2} \\frac{1+ \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right]^{-1} \\approx 1.44times the self-information."
"In this paper we investigate the weight structure of cyclic codes of composite lengthn = n_{1} n_{2}. The actual minimum distances of some classes of binary cyclic codes of composite length are derived. For other classes, new lower bounds on the minimum distance are obtained.

It is shown that the unit-memory codes are byte oriented in such a way as to be attractive for use in concatenated coding systems."
"A space-time point process is a stochastic process having as realizations points with random coordinates in both space and time. We define a general class of space-time point processes which we term {\\em analytic}. These are point processes that have only finite numbers of points in finite time intervals, absolutely continuous joint-occurrence distributions, and for which points do not occur with certainty in finite time intervals. Analytic point processes possess an intensity determined by the past of the point process. As a class, analytic point processes remain closed under randomization by a parameter. The problem we consider is that of estimating a random parameter of an observed space-time point process. This parameter may be drawn from a function space and can, therefore, model a random variable, random process, or random field that influences the space-time point process. Feedback interactions between the point process and the randomizing parameter are included. The conditional probability measure of the parameter given the observed space-time point process is a sufficient statistic for forming estimates satisfying a wide variety of performance criteria. A general representation for this conditional measure is developed, and applications to filtering, smoothing, prediction, and hypothesis testing are given."
"We describe the role of various stochastic processes, especially martingales and related concepts, in estimation theory. It is shown, in the simplest context, that in nonlinear estimation theory martingales play the same fundamental role as uncorrelation and white noise do in linear estimation."
"In analogy with the Wiener-Itô theory of multiple integrals and orthogonal polynominals, a set of functionals of general square-integrable martingales is presented which, in the case of independent-increments processes, is orthogonal and complete in the sense that everyL^{2}-functional of the independent-increment process can be represented as an infinite sum of these elementary functionals. The functionals are iterated integrals of the basic martingales, similar to the multiple iterated integrals of Itô and can be also thought of as being the analogs of the powers1,x,x^{2}, \\cdotsof the usual calculus. The analogy is made even clearer by observing that expanding the Doleans-Dade formula for the exponential of the process in a Taylor-like series leads again to the above elementary functionals. A recursive formula for these functionals in terms of the basic martingale and of lower order functionals is given, and several connections with the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces associated with independent-increment processes are obtained."
        "The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) often is used instead of the optimum Karhunen-Lo\\grave{e}ve transform (KLT) in encoding a stationary normal time series, because the recursive FFT is computationally efficient and yields \"nearly\" uncorrelated components. Substituting the DFT for the KLT and then treating its components as if they were uncorrelated reduces the ultimate performance attainable in fixed-rate source coding. We address the problem of this performance degradation by deriving a simple and easily applied upper bound on the increase in the distortion-rate function (DRF) for the mean-squared error criterion incurred by substitution of the DFT for the KLT."
"A state-space model of a second-order random process is a representation as a linear combination of a set of state-variables which obey first-order linear differential equations driven by an input process that is both white and uncorrelated with the initial values of the state-variables. Such a representation is often called a Markovian representation. There are applications in which it is useful to consider time running backwards and to obtain corresponding backwards Markovian representations. Except in one very special circumstance, these backwards representations cannot be obtained simply by just reversing the direction of time in a forwards Markovian representation. We show how this problem can be solved, give some examples, and also illustrate how the backwards model can be used to clarify certain least squares smoothing formulas."
"We consider the problem of maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter in the first-order autoregressive stationary process after loss of information due to hard limiting. For this particular transformation, the exact maximum likelihood estimator is found, and its distribution function is approximated. A numerical comparison with the common estimate obtained from the original data shows that, for moderate sample sizes and small variance of the error term, very little precision is lost as a result of the binary transformation. On the other hand, the suggested estimator is simple and easy to compute."
"Recently, Tong has studied the problem of fitting an autoregressive (AR) model to a stochastic signal with noisy data. In this correspondence, we study the associated problem of fitting a smooth moving average to noisy data. The approach is again based on an information criterion due to Akaike."
"Developments are described which allow investigation of a certain simple monitor's performance when a reset procedure is varied and when frequency of false alarms is included in the measure of cost."
 "We derive sequences of upper and lower bounds that converge to the capacity of a binary channel in which a one takes twice as long to send as does a zero and may be received either as a one or as a pair of zeros. Such a fission mechanism can occur, for example, in the use of Morse code over a noisy channel. Next we present a sequential decoding algorithm for the channel which is particularly easy to implement. By means of the Perron-Frobenius theorem and an extension of Zigangirov's analysis of sequential decoding, we overbound error probability and thereby again underbound capacity. The resulting lower bound turns out to be within 0.014 nats of the fourteenth-order upper bound to capacity, uniformly in the fission probability. By extending an analytical method due in part to Jelinek, we overbound expected decoding computation and thereby lowerboundR_{comp}."
"A large class of lower bounds relating to the performance of hypothesis testers, channel codes, and source compression codes is developed. These are extensions of Fano's inequality on the one hand, and of the discrimination inequality of Kullback on the other. The hypothesis testing and channel coding bounds are interesting primarily for small blocklengths and, in general, are asymptotically inferior to the well-known exponentially decreasing bounds. The source compression results include new proofs of converse coding theorems. A lower bound is given to the probability that a source produces an output block which cannot be encoded within a desired maximum distortion."
"The paper presents models for discrete-time point processes (DTPP) and schemes for recursive estimation of signals randomly influencing their rates. Although the models are similar to the better known models of signals in additive Gaussian noise, DTPP differ from these in that it is possible for DTPP's to find recursive representations for the nonlinear filters. If the signal can be modeled as a finite state Markov process, then these representations reduce to explicit recursive finite-dimensional filters. The derivation of the estimation schemes, as well as the filters themselves, present a surprising similarity to the Kalman filters for signals in Gaussian noise. We present finally an application of the estimation schemes derived in the paper to the estimation of the state of a random time-division multiple access (ALOHA-type) computer network."
"A method of using error-correcting codes to obtain data compression, called syndrome-source-coding, is described in which the source sequence is treated as an error pattern whose syndrome forms the compressed data. It is shown that syndrome-source-coding can achieve arbitrarily small distortion with the number of compressed digits per source digit arbitrarily close to the entropy of a binary memoryless source. A \"universal\" generalization of syndrome-source-coding is formulated which provides robustly effective distortionless coding of source ensembles. Two examples are given comparing the performance of noiseless universal syndrome-source-coding to 1) run-length coding and 2) Lynch-Davisson-Schalkwijk-Cover universal coding for an ensemble of binary memoryless sources."
"Wozencraft and Kennedy have suggested that the appropriate demodulator criterion of goodness is the cutoff rate of the discrete memoryless channel (DMC) created by the modulation system; the criterion of goodness adopted in this paper is the \"symmetric\" cutoff rate which differs from the former criterion only in that the signals are assumed equally likely. Massey's necessary condition for optimal coherent demodulation of binary signals is generalized toM-ary signals. It is shown that the optimal demodulator decision regions in likelihood space are bounded by hyperplanes. An iterative method is formulated for finding these optimal decision regions from an initial \"good guess.\" For additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the corresponding optimal decision regions in signal space are bounded by hypersurfaces with hyperplane asymptotes; these asymptotes themselves bound the decision regions of a demodulator which, in several examples, is shown to be virtually optimal. In many cases, the necessary condition for demodulator optimality is also sufficient, but a counterexample to its general sufficiency is given."
"Often, the cepstrum has been used when estimating the time delay r between elements of a composite signal embedded in noise,n(t). Here a probabilistic analysis is conducted dealing with the effect of stationary Gaussian noise on the characteristics of such a nonlinear processor. The input noise,n(t)is reflected at the cepstrum's output as: 1) modulationM_{1}(\\omega)of sinusoidal information carrier with subsequent reduction in the height of echo peak at\\tau; and 2) generation of background noises\\hat{phi}(\\omega)and\\hat{psi}(\\omega)with tendency to obscure that echo peak. The resulting probabilities of these terms are derived. The expected mean and standard deviation of reduction in the peak level at\\taudue to noise are analytically described. Similar statistical measures on the background noise are also obtained. The results point out the dependence of the-statistical measures upon the pointwise variation of input signal to noise spectra. Thus the total signal power to total noise power(S/N)alone is an insufficient measure for setting the cepstrum performance, and relative bandwidths of signal and noise are also needed. The detection probabilityP_{D}of a peak corresponding to\\tauis calculated for exponential spectra with equal bandwidths in signal and noise and with echo strengtha = 0.4; P_{D}is found to be close to one for anSINgreater than -4 dB; deterioration in detection is found to be rapid with thresholding near anS/N \\sim -6db whereP_{D}falls to 0.3."
"We present new classes of binary codes that are constructed on the basis of concatenated codes and product codes. We discuss the random-error-correction capabilities of these codes.

"We consider basic limitations on the amount of protocol information that must be transmitted in a data communication network to keep track of source and receiver addresses and of the starting and stopping of messages. Assuming Poisson message arrivals between each communicating source-receiver pair, we find a lower bound on the required protocol information per message. This lower bound is the sum of two terms, one for the message length information, which depends only on the distribution of message lengths, and the other for the message start information, which depends only on the product of the source-receiver pair arrival rate and the expected delay for transmitting the message. Two strategies are developed which, in the limit of large numbers of sources and receivers, almost meet the lower bound on protocol information."

"The detection of two-dimensional optical signals which have been corrupted by noise is considered. Discussion is limited to the detection of a known object in a known location. The problem is approached from the classical statistical technique of hypothesis testing. Initially the solution is formulated in very general terms. The decision rule is derived for a signal distorted by noise of an unspecified type which may include signal dependent noise. Once the decision rule is obtained, the probabilities of false alarm and detection are evaluated from a{\\sl a priori}knowledge of the noise and imaging system. The general results are applied to Poisson noise, signal dependent Gaussian noise, and binomial noise."

"Modern communication theory and practice are heavily dependent on the representation of continuous parameter signals by linear combinations, involving a denumerable set of random variables. Among the best known and most useful is the cardinal seriesf_{n} (t) = \\sum^{+n}_{-n} f(k) \\frac{\\sin \\pi (t - k)}{ \\pi ( t - k )}for deterministic functions and wide-sense stationary stochastic processes bandlimited to(-\\pi, \\pi). When, as invariably occurs in applications, samplesf(k)are available only over a finite period, the resulting finite approximation is subject to a truncation error. For functions which areL_{1}Fourier transforms supported on[-\\pi + \\delta, + \\pi - \\delta], uniform trunction error bounds of the formO(n^{-1})are known. We prove that analogousO(n^{-1})bounds remain valid without the guard band\\deltaand for Fourier-Stieltjes transforms; we require only a bounded variation condition in the vicinity of the endpoints- \\piand+ \\piof the basic interval. Our methods depend on a Dirichlet kernel representation forf_{n}(t)and on properties of functions of bounded variation; this contrasts with earlier approaches involving series or complex variable theory. Other integral kernels (such as the Fejer kernel) yield certain weighted truncated cardinal series whose errors can also be bounded. A mean-square trunction error bound is obtained for bandlimited wide-sense stationary stochastic processes. This error estimate requires a guard band, and leads to a uniformO(n^{-2})bound. The approach again employs the Dirichlet kernel and draws heavily on the arguments applied to deterministic functions."

If two successive video frames are considered, their differences are approximately a linear combination of the components of the displacement of the object. If all the points of the frame undergo the same movement, then the velocity estimation problem is solved using linear estimation. However, if some points belong to the moving object and the others to the background, the problem can be stated in the same way only if an algorithm is available to segment the image into fixed and moving areas. Afterwards, linear estimation can be applied to the moving area only. In this paper a segmentation algorithm is proposed which uses dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm with three states). A more complex situation arises when the points belonging to the moving area are subjected to different movements. The problem can be solved once more using dynamic programming if the displacement components are quantized into(2M + 1) (2M + 1)values, and the number of states of the Viterbi algorithm is augmented to(2M + 1)^{2}. To reduce the technical difficulties of this approach, a simpler method that makes possible the estimation of thenmost probable displacements is proposed. Then the image is segmented into n moving areas with different displacements and a background area using a Viterbi algorithm withn + 1states. Experimental results show that the precision obtainable is about 0.1 pel when the displacements are up to 2-3 pels, the object had approximate dimensions of90 \\times 90pels, and the signal-to-noise ratio was higher than 33 dB."
"This paper considers the reduction in algorithmic complexity that can be achieved by permitting approximate answers to computational problems. It is shown that Shannon's rate-distortion function could, under quite general conditions, provide lower bounds on the mean complexity of inexact computations. As practical examples of this approach, we show that partial sorting ofNitems, insisting on matching any nonzero fraction of the terms with their correct successors, requiresO (N \\log N)comparisons. On the other hand, partial sorting in linear time is feasible (and necessary) if one permits any finite fraction of pairs to remain out of order. It is also shown that any error tolerance below 50 percent can neither reduce the state complexity of binaryN-sequences from the zero-error value ofO(N)nor reduce the combinational complexity ofN-variable Boolean functions from the zero-error level ofO(2^{N}/N)."
"It is shown that distribution-free confidence intervals can be placed about the resubstitution estimate of the probability of error of any linear discrimination procedure."
"The multiple decision problem of identifying the mode of a discrete (k-valued) random variable is examined under a time-varying finite memory constraint. Under the assumption that the distribution of the observed random variable has a unique mode, the partial information model, in which it is assumed that the two largest probabilities can be separated by a known number, is shown to be2kstate perfectly achievable. The general model, in which no assumptions are made on the distribution save the fact that the mode is unique, is shown to be4k (k - 1)state perfectly achievable."
"This correspondence considers the problem of maximization of the divergence between a pair of unequal mean and unequal covariance matrix Gaussian distributed pattern classes. The original pattern space is transformed into a new space such that the sum of the covariance matrices is a unit matrix. From this relationship, a set of orthonormal directions are obtained sequentially such that, when the patterns are projected onto each of these directions, the divergence between the pattern classes is maximized."
"A discrete random variableXis to be transmitted by means of a discrete signal. The receiver has prior knowledge of a discrete random variableYjointly distributed withX. The probability of error must be exactly zero, and the problem is to minimize the signal's alphabet size. In the case where the transmitter also has access to the value ofY, the problem is trivial and no advantage can be obtained by block coding over independent repetitions. If, however,Yis not known at the transmitter then the problem is equivalent to the chromatic number problem for graphs, and block coding may produce savings."
"The mutual information plays a central role in communication theory; its general expression for stochastic processes has already been derived. Based on this expression, this correspondence provides an alternative representation of the mutual information for Gaussian processes which is useful in estimation problems."
"The first moment of the decoding effort for stack sequential decoding is overbounded by a relatively simple technique. The resulting lower bound toR_{comp}is shown to be equivalent to the best known lower bound."
"It is shown that Goppa codes with Goppa polynomial\\{g(z)\\}^{q}have the parameters: lengthn \\leq q^{m} - s_{o}, number of check symbolsn - k \\leq m (q - 1) (\\deg g), and minimum distanced \\geq q (\\deg g) + 1, whereqis a prime power,mis an integer,g(z )is an arbitrary polynomial overGF(q^{m}), and so is the number of roots ofg(z)which belong toGF(q^{m}). It is also shown that all binary Goppa codes of lengthn \\leq 2^{m} - s_{o}satisfy the relationn - k \\leq m (d - 1)/2. A new class of binary codes withn \\leq 2^{ m} + ms _{0}, n - k \\leq m (\\deg g) + s_{0}, andd \\leq 2(\\deg g) + 1is constructed, as well as another class of binary codes with slightly different parameters. Some of those codes are proved superior to the best codes previously known. Finally, a decoding algorithm is given for the codes constructed which uses Euclid's algorithm."
"In this paper, theoretical justification is established for the common practice of applying the Kalman filter estimator to three classes of linear quadratic problems where the model statistics are not completely known, and hence specification of the filter gains is not optimum. The Kalman filter is shown to be a minimax estimator for one class of problems and to satisfy a saddlepoint condition in the other two classes of problems. Equations for the worst case covariance matrices are given which allow the specifications of the minimax Kalman filter gains and the worst case distributions for the respective classes of problems. Both time-varying and time-invariant systems are treated."
"The probability density and confidence intervals for the maximum entropy (or regression) method (MEM) of spectral estimation are derived using a Wishart model for the estimated covariance. It is found that the density for the estimated transfer function of the regression filter may be interpreted as a generalization of the student's t distribution. Asymptotic expressions are derived which are the same as those of Akaike. These expressions allow a direct comparison between the performance of the maximum entropy (regression) and maximum likelihood methods under these asymptotic conditions. Confidence intervals are calculated for an example consisting of several closely space tones in a background of white noise. These intervals are compared with those for the maximum likelihood method (MLM). It is demonstrated that, although the MEM has higher peak to background ratios than the MLM, the confidence intervals are correspondingly larger. Generalizations are introduced for frequency wavenumber spectral estimation and for the joint density at different frequencies."
"A formula for the continuous part of the power spectral density of a block coded digital PAM signal is well known for the case of independent blocks. Based on this formula, a procedure is proposed for the synthesis of block codes yielding a polynomial approximation to a desired signal power spectral density. The code is defined by a matrix multiplication over the set of real numbers. An expression is also found for the length of the codewords and source words in terms of the degree of the approximating polynomial and the cardinality of a particular subset of its real zeros."
"A constructive proof is given for the existence and uniqueness of a two-dimensional discrete Markov random field which agrees with correlation values in a nearest neighbor array. The corresponding spectrum is the two-dimensional maximum entropy (ME) spectrum whose form was discovered by Burg. An iterative algorithm is developed for computing an approximation to this Markov spectrum for a regularly spaced array. The algorithm approximates the desired Markov correlation function by a truncated convolution power series (CPS) in an operatorh. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated on both simulated data and real noise data. The Markov spectral estimate can offer higher resolution than previously proposed spectral estimates."
"This paper considers the convergence properties and numerical behavior of an adaptive equalization algorithm. Particular attention is paid to the behavior of the algorithm when the computations are carried out with limited precision arithmetic as would be the case in a real implementation. It is shown that a previous conjecture regarding the best ordering of the step size parameters does not hold when numerical errors are significant. An alternative stable ordering is given in the paper."
"Slowly fading channels, such as a troposcatter communication link, are characterized by multiple error bursts which may last for many thousand channel digits, as well as by random errors. It is shown that even the best random error-correcting codes cannot be effective on this type of channel unless some time delay between code letters is introduced to reduce the correlation between channel errors within the code. In addition to the conventional approach of interleaving code letters to obtain error independence, two alternative coding approaches are considered which correct random errors as well as detect and correct multiple bursts, i.e., multiple channel fades. A concatenated coding approach, based on interleaving inner code blocks but not interleaving digits within an inner block, and a new multiple-burst correction code based on generalized burst trapping codes, are shown to represent attractive alternatives to the conventional interleaver approach."
"A decoding rule is presented which minimizes the probability of symbol error over a time-discrete memory]ess channel for any linear error-correcting code when the codewords are equiprobable. The complexity of this rule varies inversely with code rate, making the technique particularly attractive for high rate codes. Examples are given for both block and convolutional codes."
      "An approximation to the existing optimal algorithm for simultaneously tracking several moving targets is proposed which greatly reduces the required memory and number of calculations, but nevertheless retains reasonable accuracy (as is shown by analytic consideration and by Monte Carlo simulations) when the number of states is much greater than the number of targets. It is shown where errors arise in the approximation and how the errors tend to stabilize as the process evolves. Computational results on a highly idealized biological population surveillance problem are given that tend to confirm assertions concerning the relative computational efficiency and accuracy of the suboptimal rule in comparison to the optimal solution. A more realistic radar simulation study (20 targets and 10 000 states) is reported that suggests the scope of application of thc methodology proposed here."
"The effects of autoregressive dependence on nonparametric detection are studied. An approximation technique is used to prove the asymptotic normality of a class of two-sample rank test statistics operating on stationary autoregressive processes. The effect of second-order autoregressive dependence on the asymptotic relative efficiency of the Mann-Whitney detector is illustrated. \"Studentization\" is proposed as a means of restoring the distribution-free character of rank tests when operating on dependent data. Under autoregressive dependence a consistent estimator for the variance of a class of two-sample rank test statistics is developed, and it is shown that the studentized versions of these statistics are asymptotically normal with mean zero and variance one. Simulation results are presented for the rate of convergence of the studentized two-sample Wilcox0n detector when operating on first-order and second-order stationary autoregressive processes."
"A method of analysis is presented for the class of binary sequence generators employing linear feedback shift registers with nonlinear feed-forward operations. This class is of special interest because the generators are capable of producing very long \"unpredictable\" sequences. The period of the sequence is determined by the linear feedback connections, and the portion of the total period needed to predict the remainder is determined by the nonlinear feed-forward operations. The linear feedback shift registers are represented in terms of the roots of their characteristic equations in a finite field, and it is shown that nonlinear operations inject additional roots into the representation. The number of roots required to represent a generator is a measure of its complexity, and is equal to the length (number of stages) of the shortest linear feedback shift register that produces the same sequence. The analysis procedure can be applied to any arbitrary combination of binary shift register generators, and is also applicable to the synthesis of complex generators having desired properties. Although the discussion in this paper is limited to binary sequences, the analysis is easily extended to similar devices that generate sequences with members in any finite field."
"A particular shortening technique is applied to majority logic decodable codes of length2^{t}. The shortening technique yields new efficient codes of lengthsn = 2^{p}, wherepis a prime, e.g., a (128,70) code withd_{maj} = 16. For moderately long code lengths (e.g.,n = 2^{11} or 2^{13}), a 20-25 percent increase in efficiency can be achieved over the best previously known majority logic decodable codes. The new technique also yields some efficient codes for lengthsn = 2^{m}wheremis a composite number, for example, a (512,316) code withd_{maj} = 32code which has 42 more information bits than the previously most efficient majority logic decodable code."
"A highly efficient method of evaluating probabilities of detection and the generalized\\cal Q-function to within an absolute accuracy\\epsilonis presented. Many unnecessary computations are avoided when it can be determined by Chernoff bounds that the desired function is within\\epsilonof 0 or 1. When this is not the case, efficient algorithms for the necessary computations are also provided."
"Permutation modulation codes are a class of group codes for the Gaussian channel whose codewords are obtained by permuting the components of a given initial vectorXin Euclideann-dimensional space. In this paper, the problem of choosing the components ofXin such a way that the minimum distance between any two codewords is maximized is solved. In particular, a closed-form expression is obtained for this minimum distance and is used to investigate the asymptotic behavior of some selected codes."
"A strategy is given for cooperative bidding by the players which results in the location of all 52 cards being encoded into a valid bridge auction which always terminates with a contract of six diamonds. Strategies are also given for encoding the card locations into auctions in which \"double\" and/or \"redouble\" are prohibited bids."
"A new scheme for enumerating the legal bidding sequences in bridge is developed for various constraints on the allowed bids. It is shown that such bidding sequences can be represented by fixed length strings from aD-ary alphabet and that all such strings represent bidding sequences."
"A new bound on the error-correcting capability of majority decoding using nonorthogonal parity checks is derived. The new bound is then applied to a class of Euclidean geometry codes."
"The notion of supplementary difference sets is used to construct codes which are one-step majority logic decodable using orthogonal parity checks. An infinite family of single and double error-correcting codes is constructed. Strong evidence is given which suggests that there exists an analogous infinite family of triple error-correcting codes."
"The problem of minimizing mean-square error when digital data is encoded into the elements of a group code via an encoding map a and the received elements of the group code are decoded via a decoding map\\betais considered. This problem has been solved under the restriction that\\beta = \\alpha^{-1}. It is shown that the same solution still obtains when this restriction is removed."
  "The publication offers a note of thanks and lists its reviewers."
"Two kinds of contemporary developments in cryptography are examined. Widening applications of teleprocessing have given rise to a need for new types of cryptographic systems, which minimize the need for secure key distribution channels and supply the equivalent of a written signature. This paper suggests ways to solve these currently open problems. It also discusses how the theories of communication and computation are beginning to provide the tools to solve cryptographic problems of long standing."
"The problem of data compression for communication networks is considered. The system performance criterion is the signal distortion resulting both from data compression and from average message delay through the network. The delay-distortion function is defined as the smallest message delay among all data-compression schemes that yield the given distortion value. The distortion-delay region is similarly defined. The capacity region is defined to include all incoming message rates for which there exists a set of data-compression schemes yielding a prescribed network distortion-delay value. The basic characteristics of these functions and regions are derived. In particular, it is shown that their evaluations can be performed by solving separately the source coding problem and the network's queuing problem. The distortion-delay functions and regions are explicitly derived for single channel systems."
"Gallager's exponent functionE_{\\circ}, (\\rho,p)plays a crucial role in the derivation of bounds for coding error probabilities. An iterative algorithm for computing the maximum ofE_{\\circ} (\\rho,p)over the set of input probability distributions is presented. The algorithm is similar to that of Arimoto and Blahut for computing channel capacity. It is shown that the approximation error is at most inversely proportional to the number of iterations. A similar iterative algorithm for computing the source code reliability-rate function also is presented."
"A tree coding theorem is established for discrete-time abstract alphabet stationary block-ergodic sources under a single-letter fidelity criterion. The proof of this theorem uses recent results from the theory of branching processes with random environments. The relation to previous work in tree coding is also discussed."
"Sliding-block codes are nonblock coding structures consisting of discrete-time time-invariant possibly nonlinear filters. They are equivalent to time-invariant trellis codes. The coupling of Forney's rigorization of Shannon's random-coding/typical-sequence approach to block coding theorems with the strong Rohlin-Kakutani Theorem of ergodic theory is used to obtain a sliding-block coding theorem for ergodic sources and discrete memoryless noisy channels. Combining this result with a theorem on sliding-block source coding with a fidelity criterion yields a sliding-block information transmission theorem. Thus, the basic existence theorems of information theory hold for stationary nonblock structures, as well as for block codes."
"The observation processyconsidered is an additive composition of continuous and discontinuous components. The additive Gaussian, point, and jump process models, treated separately in the past, are all included here simultaneously. Representations foryin terms of its innovations and following a Girsanov-type measure transformation are derived. These are then used to develop a measure form of Bayes' rule that provides a convenient tool for the study of estimation and decision problems arising in a variety of applications including communication and control."
"The source coding theory of information theory is applied to the digital processing of synthetic aperture radar signals. A lower bound is established on the data rate that must exist at any point in the processing flow, in particular at the conversion from analog-to-digital (A/D) signals, to achieve a given output map signal-to-noise ratio. The usual linear uniform-step A/D conversion of in-phase and quadrature coherent video signals is found to provide a given output map signal-to-noise ratio with a data rate within about 20 percent of the derived lower bound."

"The experiments were done using a powder mixture of Nb, Al and Ge with a particle diameter of less than 50 μm which was filled into Ta- or Nb-tubes. These composites were cold-worked and heated from 400°C (10°C/min) up to 850 or 900°C and annealed 20 min on this temperature. By this heat treatment in many areas the intermetallic compound Nb(Al,Ge)3is formed within the powder mixture. After a second cold deformation the composites were annealed at 1000, 1200 or 1300°C with different annealing times. Microprobe analysis was used to investigate the phase distribution. The formation of the A15-phase was also investigated by transition temperature measurements, which were done by the inductive method. The highest transition temperature was found after 1300°C furnace annealing. Maximum critical current was achieved by short-time resistive annealing at 1200°C of 0.5 mm θ wire. The reason for the high current carrying capacity of the short-time annealed samples can be seen from the Tc-measurements which show that a A15-phase with high transition temperature is formed even after a short annealing time. Possible improvements of superconductors made from powder mixtures are discussed."
 "The molecular field coefficients for the individual rare earth iron garnets have been determined by a trial and error procedure using the phenomenological molecular field theory of Neél and the experimental curves for each rare-earth iron garnet. These results were then used to calculate magnetic moment-temperature curves for various film compositions subject to the conditions that the lattice parameter of the film and λ (111) for the film be specified. Also the concentration of the diamagnetic ion (Al3+or Ga3+) can be adjusted to yield a room temperature moment between 200 and 230 G for any film composition."
"Magnetic tape velocity variations are determined with a read while write head by measuring the frequency difference between the write current signal and the playback signal from the read gap. This frequency difference may correspond to either tape acceleration or velocity, depending on the period at which the tape velocity is varying, and it can be measured by observing beat frequencies on a storage oscilloscope."
"The effect of a small dc in-plane field on the start-stop operation of field access bubble devices has been studied. Experimental results show that the bias margin in this mode is very sensitive to the magnitude of the field and its orientation relative to the start-stop direction of the drive field. In a T-I circuit a complete margin loss was observed for an in-plane field of 3 Oe oriented antiparallel to the start-stop direction. For parallel orientations of the in-plane field the start-stop margin improved and approached that of the continuous propagation margin at an in-plane field of approximately 6 Oe. Dependence of the start-stop margin on the orientation of the start-stop direction relative to the pattern was also observed. Measurements of the bubble collapse field at various points in the pattern show a very strong dependence on the in-plane field and the permalloy geometry. The collapse-field results and magnetostatic energy considerations which take into account local field variations and bubble-bubble interactions provide a basis for understanding the experimentally observed start-stop margins. These results show that a small tilt (2 to 3°) should be introduced in the bias field to overcome normal alignment tolerances and ensure that a favorable in-plane field is always present. This assures reliable start-stop operation."
"The frequency (wavelength) response function of a magnetic reproduce head consisting of semi-infinite zero thickness parallel plates of infinite permeability is computed."
"The evolution of disk storage technology is examined along with its application in current and possible future disk files. Progress in bubble storage technology is considered, and its merits are assessed as a competing storage technology. Tradeoffs in cost and performance are studied, which can enhance the application of disks and bubbles in computer storage hierarchies. Finally, likely entry points for bubbles in storage hierarchies are identified along with the required advances in bubble storage density."
"Long wavelength response characteristics for the class of elliptical reproduce heads are calculated. Simple series solutions are obtained for a flat recorded medium, and numerical methods are used for a tape wrapped over the head at arbitrary contact angles. Special eccentricities of the ellipse yield classical results. Many geometries lead to low frequency bumps on the response curve."
"A very large forced magnetostriction was observed for Y2Fe17and Lu2Fe17hexagonal single crystals near their ordering temperatures. The isotropic exchange coefficients are large, compared with the anisotropic terms. These results, which are consistent with the large magnetic volume anomaly observed previously, are interpreted in terms of the dependence of the magnetic interactions on interatomic distance. The largest magnetostriction is measured along the c-axis and a positive sign is observed for (c/a)/(c/a). Both these results are associated with the strong dependence on interatomic distance of the negative interactions occurring in the substitution zones."
"A new transmission electron microscope method of measuring fine scale magnetic flux distributions, and in particular the fields associated with magnetic recording heads, is described. An island structured metallic foil or an amorphous film acts as a diffuse scatterer of transmitted electrons. A magnetic field in the region below the scatterer deflects the electron trajectories and as a result distorts the image of the scatterer. The local shearing of the image is compared to a reference zero field image by a double exposure of a photographic plate. Optical Fraunhofer diffraction by transmission through the developed plate shows Young's fringes which reveal the direction and magnitude of the local image shift which is related to the magnetic field component perpendicular to the electron trajectories. In some applications the method is potentially several orders of magnitude more sensitive than other electron beam methods."
"In antiferromagnets (AF) the exchange interaction enhances the influence of hyperfine and spin-orbit interactions upon statics and dynamics of the magnetic system. Therefore the use of small anysotropy AF's instead of ferrites can sometimes improve the technical performance of the devices based on magneto elastic and other phenomena."
  "The measurements of cyclic magnetization loss in a 3% Si-Fe monocrystal with known domain structures reported by Swift et al. (1974) are compared with the predictions of the Pry and Bean model, a skew planar wall model, and a model of domain wall bowing which neglects the dependence of domain wall energy per unit area on the crystallographic orientation of the wall. Detailed agreement is not obtained, but the trend of the bowing model behaviour is encouraging. Consideration of the consequences of the dependence of wall energy on orientation indicates that it should assist the initiation of bowing at lower frequencies and restrain severe bowing at high frequencies. This is expected to lead to a reduction in the losses, especially at low frequencies, and to a general straightening of the loss/frequency characteristic in accord with the trend of the observations. The discrepancy between the measured losses and the Pry and Bean model has previously been attributed to edge effects according to the calculations of Young et al. (1975) It is shown in the present paper, however, that the Pry and Bean model requires negligible correction for edge effects provided the domain walls are well separated on the scale of the sheet thickness."

"The magnetostatic fields of the I and T pattern Permalloy overlay bars are analyzed by proposing a model based on the Bitter pattern observation of the domain wall structure in Permalloy bars. The magnetic charges that appear on the 90° domain walls are assumed to be the sources of the magnetic fields of the bars. The model has a two-dimensional reaction to an applied rotating in-plane field due to its two-dimensional domain wall movement and the consequent two-dimensional change of magnetic domain pattern inside the bar. The magnetization of the bar is equal to Msthe saturation magnetization of the bar at every section of the bar except on the domain walls. The magnetization curve and the magnetic field well Bz(bubble drive field) under the overlay bars are calculated and compared to that of the previous models. A qualitative explanation of the rotation of the bubble around the bars is given by the three-dimensional plots of the field well obtained for different orientations of the in-plane field."
"The known expressions for magnetic energy associated with domain structures are used to calculate magnetization curves and magnetic hysteresis loops of polycrystalline ferromagnetic bodies when they are subjected to either tension or compression. Reversible and irreversible boundary displacement and domain rotation have been taken into account. The model used permits a qualitative description of the magnetization processes for ordinary magnetically soft materials, and materials with constricted and narrow hysteresis loops. This model has also been used for explaining the magnetoelastic properties of a ferromagnetic material."
"Relative humidity has been recognized as an important environmental factor in many head-tape interface phenomena such as headwear, friction, staining, and tape shed. Accordingly, the relative humidity is usually specified in many applications of tape use, especially when tape recorders are enclosed in hermetically sealed cases. Normally, the relative humidity is believed regulated by humidification of the fill gas to the specification relative humidity. However, this study demonstrates that the internal relative humidity in a sealed case is completely controlled by the time-dependence of the hygroscopic properties of the pack of magnetic recording tape. Procedures for the humidity conditioning of sealed cases must be established on the basis of the tapes' hygroscopic properties, and not on humidification of the fill gas. Without taking the tape into account, the final, stabilized, relative humidity can be significantly different from the specification requirement. Additionally, this same study finds differences in the hygroscopic properties of the same brand of tape, which apparently results from aging, and which may have significance on the long-term humidity-regulating behavior in a sealed case, and on the occurrence of head-tape interface phenomena from the long-term use of the tape. This article presents results on the basic hygroscopic properties of tape, its humidity-regulating behavior in a sealed case, and includes a theoretical commentary on the relative humidity dependence of head-wear by tape."
 "Permendur in laminated form is often used in magnetic cores of machines and transformers where it might be subjected to mechanical stress. Measurements have been made to determine to what extent the a.c. iron loss and magnetostriction are affected by such linear stress. Magnetic properties were found to be dependent on heat treatment over the temperature range 400°C to 900°C. The loss of material annealed above 710°C rose steeply when compressive stress up to 100 MN/m2was applied, whereas under tension it first dropped slightly and then rose steadily as the stress was increased to 300 MN/m2. The iron loss of material annealed below 710°C was high, but its stress sensitivity was low; there was a more significant drop in loss under tension and only a marginal increase under compression. The magnetostriction was found to decrease rapidly under tension and its stress sensitivity did not vary greatly with heat treatment."
"The structure and magnetic properties of amorphous transition elements is reviewed. The methods of obtaining suitable samples will be discussed, the structural investigations so far carried out will be described, and the results compared with those obtained from model building. The experimental measurements on the effect of structural disorder on the magnetic moment and Curie temperature of the transition elements will be reviewed in the light of current theoretical progress."
"The theory of phase transitions in magnetic systems with surfaces is reviewed. Results of the phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg theory as well the scaling theory are briefly presented and compared with those obtained for particular microscopic models. Possibilities of special kinds of magnetic phase transitions in systems with surfaces are also presented."
"The spin polarized photoemission experiment is shortly described. Some of the more serious difficulties in analyzing the data are mentioned, with special emphasis on the influence of the surface on the polarization of the emitted electron beam. Three measurements: 1) determination of the escape depth of the photoelectrons, 2) spin polarized photoemission from EuO, and 3) Ni, serve as examples for demonstrating the power-but also the problems-of this type of experiment."
"The absorption Coefficient and the interband Faraday rotation of EuS, EuSe, and EuTe thin films have been measured as a function of the photon energy (1-6 eV), the temperature (2.7-300 K), and the applied magnetic field (0.1-11.5 kOe). From the Faraday rotation (FR) we compute the circular magnetic dichroism and from both and the optical constantsnandkwe derive the imaginary part of the off-diagonal elements of the complex conductivity tensor Im σxy. Integral values of the latter depend on the spin polarization of electronic states and permit a distinction between pd and fd transitions."
"Mössbauer experiments were made utilizing Co57or Fe57as a microprobe for studying the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic metal surfaces. For the emission spectroscopy, carrier-free Co57atoms were electrodeposited on a surface of bulk iron. The absorption spectroscopy was applied to a sample whose surface was selectively enriched with Fe57. In both cases, the spectra at 4.2 K showed that all iron atoms in the surface are ferromagnetic, but the reduced hyperfine field suggests a partial decrease of the local magnetic moment."
"Amorphous GdxFe1-x(0 < x < 0.35) thin films were prepared by RF cosputtering using an iron target covered partially with small gadolinium pieces. The composition dependences of saturation magnetization, hysteresis curves, and domain structures were studied. Spark-like domains were observed when the magnetization was reversed from saturation. The uniaxial anisotropy was induced perpendicular to the film plane. The average value of the perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku was about 2 × 105erg/cm3. Ku, however, decreases as the saturation moment decreases in the vicinity of room temperature compensation. The stripe domain width was varied from 0.3 to 4 microns as the saturation moment decreased from 300 to 20 gauss. These magnetic properties of amorphous Gd-Fe sputtered films are similar to those of amorphous Gd-Co films."
"The presence of a free surface leads to an inhomogeneous distribution of the local magnetization and other quantities describing the magnetic state of the system. After a brief outline of a general thermodynamic theory, the mean field treatment is discussed and shown to be inconsistent with a more general scaling theory, even if one uses a temperature-dependent extrapolation length. More reliable information is obtained by numerical techniques such as high temperature series expansions and Monte Carlo calculations, which are applied to Ising and Heisenberg models. These numerical results are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory, but it is also shown that the magnetization of the surface layer m1depends strongly on the local conditions (e.g., exchange constant Jsdifferent fromJin the bulk). Therefore the observability of the universal asymptotic exponents may be restricted to a very narrow region around the (bulk) critical temperature Tcb. The case where the surface layer orders at a temperatureT_{cs} > T_{cb}is also considered. The consequences of the theory for thin magnetic films and small particles are outlined and experimental applications are briefly discussed."
"Thermomagnetic writing on low-temperature phase MnBi films was investigated. By applying short laser pulses, the undesirable transformation to the quenched high-temperature phase is inhibited. The low-temperature phase proved to be stable when heated for magnetic switching with pulses shorter than 10 μs. The transient temperature during laser heating of a 20 μm diameter film spot was determined using a thin germanium film as a reference target. The temperature shift of the transmission spectrum (λ = 633 nm) of this semiconductor material serves for optical temperature indication. The threshold temperature for stable short-pulse thermomagnetic writing on MnBi was determined by this technique to be 550°C ± 25%. The decomposition temperature was determined to be 820°C ± 25%."
"A highly sensitive method for measuring μ'±- jμ''±of ferrites far from the ferrimagnetic resonance region is proposed which makes use of the resonance splitting of counter-rotating TE11modes in the cylindrical metallic cavity resonator Filled with axially biased ferrite specimen. With a Filling factor of unity, both the frequency splitting and the change of reciprocalQare large enough to enable μ'±- jμ''±, in particular μ''±, to be measured to a maximum sensitivity of about 5 × 10-5."
"A permalloy disk replicator in an amorphous film 2 μm bubble device has been Studied for different geometrical dimensions, and from quasi-static to 200 kHz operating frequency. Distinct regions of the margin plot are observed, and their dependence on geometry is analyzed. It is found that for reliable replication over a wide margin range, the poles from the replicator disk, from the neighboring propagation channel, and from the previously replicated bubbles must be carefully balanced. A replicator with 20% margins on 2-micron GdCoMo films is shown and methods for further improvements are discussed."
"The dynamic domain formations in a single crystal MnBi platelet were examined under various external field strengths. Once the reverse domain is nucleated at one point of the saturated plate by pricking or external pulse field, the domain expands with various modes depending on the net field strength acting on the moving wall and forms various patterns. In a thick platelet, a bubble lattice is produced with no bias field, but it is suppressed by the external field; a radial stripe domain pattern or a spider web like pattern is formed depending on the field polarity. The phase velocity of the wall propagation during lattice formation was estimated as about 50m/sec by the pulse field method. This result brought us the important information about the truly complicated nature of the bubble lattice formation, i.e., the sequential process of the dynamic conversion, breakdown of velocity, static conversion, high speed propagation, and sharp deflection."

"By generalizing the stability treatment of Thiele to include the presence of a permalloy pattern, a magnetostatic energy model for describing field access devices is derived. The general implications of the model with regard to minimum drive fields and propagation margins are discussed and calculated magnetostatic energy profiles for noninteracting chevrons are presented. The question of when the permalloy elements begin to interact is examined to provide justification for treating the permalloy elements independently. Finally, a magnetoresistance model for detector analysis is proposed which may be incorporated easily into the existing modeling framework. The paper concludes by suggesting further areas of application and by discussing areas which need further improvement."
"A continuum magnetostatic energy model for describing field access bubble domain devices is introduced and a prescription for solving the modeling problem is given. Minimization of the magnetostatic energy yields an integral equation defining the magnetization in the permalloy and the solution of this magnetization problem is described in detail. Application of the formalism to the calculation of demagnetizing fields for uniformly magnetized patterns is discussed as are the solutions of the magnetization problem for simple geometries. Techniques for improving the speed and convergence of the calculations are suggested based upon the proposed interpolation scheme and are compared to other computational methods such as Fourier series expansion. In a second paper (Part II) the solution of the magnetization problem is used to calculate the drive fields acting on the bubble as well as to calculate the magnetoresistance of a chevron stretcher detector under various in-plane drive field conditions."

"Data available on the magnetic hysteresis parameters of a Co/Fe/Nb alloy (Nibcolloy) reveal several discrepancies. To resolve these inconsistencies, an experimental program involving variations in annealing treatments and magnetic properties, mechanical properties, and microstructural characterization was carried out. Results indicate that the use of an anneal on hard drawn wire to mechanically soften it for possible forming operations prior to the final aging anneal can alter the final magnetic properties. The use or elimination of this anneal was a primary source of one of the discrepancies. Other results confirmed the reduced coercivity in additionally deformed (by cold rolling) and aged drawn wire as compared to the only as-drawn wire after aging. Contrary to the results of others, a nonstability of coercivity to subsequent brief elevated temperature exposures of around 1000°C was also observed. The source of this contradiction remains unresolved."
"The magnetic force, which attracts paramagnetic particles towards a magnetized ferromagnetic wire, is calculated for the geometry which is most likely to be used for magnetic separation. It is demonstrated that the magnetic field problem has an analytic solution, from which the maximum force is obtained analytically as a very simple expression. The choice of optimum wire diameter becomes less critical than in the estimation of Oberteuffer, since the maximum is flatter, but the position of this maximum is not changed significantly, and is the same for all practical purposes."
"Factors affecting the design and performance of digital recording heads are discussed with reference to multitrack write/read heads for use with thin high-coercivity disc media. Account is taken of the flux leakage paths round each ferrite core to calculate the core efficiency and crosstalk from an adjacent core. The efficiency for a core with permeability = 1000 is about 20% less than obtained by neglecting leakage. Formulae are given to find the minimum recording gap, leakage permeances, peak output, and write current. Values are plotted versus gap length and depth, pole-tip angle, back gap, core pitch, and permeability."
"In magnetic recording, the recording fields are essentially vectorial, and the magnetization process in the recording medium has to be analyzed using vector magnetization. From this fact, a vector magnetization distribution in the recording medium must be evaluated by both magnitude and direction of magnetization. This paper describes the vector magnetization distributions obtained by a new method, using reversible and irreversible rotational magnetization model of single domain acicular particles with uniaxial anisotropy. Calculations are done self-consistently at an instant when the head field is applied and after it is removed. Although the results are, at present, limited to the case where the recording medium is standing still, they show quite good agreement with the results of scaled up model experiments, and can clearly explain the demagnetization mechanism in terms of the vector rotation. This new calculation method will, in principle, display its real power in analyzing the dynamical recording process when the recording medium is moving along the head or the head field is changing."
"A general method is given to predict write field rise time effects on isolated pulses in digital magnetic recording. The method is based on the use of a graph, which can be calculated once and for all, from which the position and the form of a transition, written under several conditions, can be derived. Emphasis is laid on pulse shift effects, and it is shown that the results obtained give good estimates, in spite of the approximations used."
"Dynamics of bubbles in field access devices operated at 100 kHz and 200 kHz have been studied using a high speed optical sampling microscope capable of making a 10 nsec single exposure photograph at a known sampling time with respect to a rotating field orientation. By scanning the sampling time through one rotating field cycle, a series of time-sequenced transient domain configurations of bubbles have been recorded on 16 mm film. The devices studied were commonly used permalloy propagating structures, T-bar, T-X, X-bar, and chevron fabricated on an epitaxial garnet film. From each frame of the 16 mm film, plots of the position of the leading and trailing edges of a bubble as a function of rotating field angle were made. These position plots revealed very nonuniform bubble motion in these circuits. The instantaneous velocities of the leading and trailing edges of the bubble were calculated from the position plots. The results show a large velocity variation in all circuits, the ratio of the maximum velocity to the average velocity ranging from 3.5 for the X-bar to 4.8 for the chevron. Maximum vetocities in excess of that predicted on the basis of the critical velocity for dynamic conversion were observed."
"This paper describes the derivation and applications of an analytical model for magnetic bubble domain propagation. A fleld-access bubble device is treated as a magnetic circuit, emphasizing fluxes rather than fields as in most previous treatments. The energy changes are calculated within the bubble domain rather than in the propagation pattern, making possible a simple analytical-graphical process for predicting device operating margins. Agreement with a large number of device experiments is shown to be good. Closed-form expressions are derived which relate the essential features of the operating margin to device geometry and bubble material magnetic properties. The application of this model to device diagnosis, optimization, and scale down is discussed."

"A new technique, whereby the so-called \"iso-directional-force lines\" may be illustrated directly, is proposed. The method is based on the levitation forces acting on a particle immersed in paramagnetic fluid in nonhomogeneous magnetic field. An ordered set of capillaries, each containing a small particle suspended in the fluid, may be used to depict the iso-directional-force lines by the equilibrium positions of the particles. Once the field is mapped (by a selected standard system), its characteristics are known, with respect to any other fluid particle combinations. The latter is of significance for research and technology."
"The dependence ot the in-plane drive field at which bubble domains spontaneously nucleate in field-accessed bubble devices has been investigated as a function ofH_{k} - 4\\piM_{s}and of spacer thickness between the bubble film and permalloy propagation elements. The experiments were carried out on amorphous GdCoMo bubble films with T-bar and Y-bar structures. For a given structure and spacer thickness the nucleation field increases linearly withH_{k} - 4\\piM. Larger spacer thicknesses also lead to increased nucleation fields. A model based on the Stoner-Wohlfarth astroid is compared to these data and found to be useful in explaining the qualitative trends, but to be in poor quantitative agreement. It is concluded that since the drive field required in a device is proportional to4\\piM_{s}, Q - 1 = (H_{k} - 4\\piM_{s})/4\\piM_{s}must be greater than some minimum value for a given device structure and spacer thickness to permit reliable device operation."
"Using the results of the phenomenological and microscopic description of magnetooptically active transitions presented in the beginning of the article, a review is made of the progress achieved in the understanding of the origin of the large bismuth induced magnetooptic effects in iron garnets. For applications involving the Faraday configuration, optical efficiencies are determined by the ratio of Faraday rotation (θ) to optical absorption (α). The dependence of θ/α on such variables as bismuth concentration,4\\piM_{s}and impurity ions is discussed with its spectral behavior. Finally, the behavior of bismuth substituted iron garnets in devices previously devised using unsubstituted iron garnets is discussed, in conjunction with devices which have only become feasible as a consequence of improvements in the optical properties of such iron garnets."

"The magnetic and electric properties of iron-nickel \"invar\" alloys and stainless steels are measured at low temperatures. It is shown that \"invar\" alloys such as stainless steels exhibit one-directional anisotropy, and their electric and galvanomagnetic properties are rather specific. It is shown also that the concentration dependence of Neel temperatures and magnetoresistance for the systems Fe-Ni and Fe65(Ni1-xCrx)35are similar."
"One of the methods for attaining free suspension of objects in magnetic fields is magnetic levitation by tuned circuits. Tuned-circuit levitators exhibit typical dynamic instability. However, the inherent tendency of the suspended object to oscillate may serve as a basis for the construction of relatively new types of machines. An attempt is made to treat, all these devices from a generalized point of view. A method similar to that used for the analysis of parametric electronic networks is suggested here to tackle parametric electromechanical systems. The paper concludes with two recent examples which illustrate how unexpected are the phenomena, where parametric electromechanical effects are of relevance. A peculiar mechanical instability which occurred in the VHF resonators used in particles accelerators, has been described recently. It has also been found that both a rotation of a suspended object as well as its levitation can be achieved by using a levitator with only one electromagnet."
"Alloys of composition Pt1-xNixFe withx = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 can be quenched from high temperature to retain a face centred cubic disordered phase. On aging, at lower temperatures, alloys withx = 0.2 and 0.3become magnetically hard with coercivities up to 2000 Oe at room temperature. In the hardened state the alloys have an ordered tetragonal structure withc/a \\sim 0.96and a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy of\\sim10^{7}erg cm-3. Electron microscopy, of magnetically hard fully tetragonal samples, reveals a {110} lamellar structure. Thecaxis of each lamella is at 90° to thecaxis of the locally dominant tetragonal matrix phase in which it is embedded. Lorentz microscopy reveals domain walls, parallel to the dominantcaxis which are \"kinked\" where they cross lamellae. The coercive forces increase on cooling below room temperature. This increase can be attributed to the decreased probability of the thermal activation of domain wall segments, over barriers, as the temperature falls. An alloy withx = 0.4formed a cubic ordered phase on aging but did not develop high coercivity or high remanent magnetization."
"The multimodal operation (jump phenomenon) of a ferroresonant circuit of practical interest is analyzed using West's method of frequency-damping boundaries with a fifth-order approximation for the saturation curve of the nonlinear inductor. For given circuit parameters, the applied voltage range over which ferroresonance can occur is determined, and it is shown that this method gives more precise information than the incremental describing function method on the possibility that a certain applied voltage will produce the jump phenomenon."
"When mechanical forces are applied to single domain particles that are used in magnetic recording tapes, the resultant stress anisotropy energy alters the magnetized state, producing reversible and irreversible changes. We use four different experimental techniques to measure these changes and analyze the results in terms of the values for the saturation magnetostriction constants (λs) and the applied stress (σx). The reversible changes in magnetization (Mx) are roughly proportional to\\lambda_{s}\\sigma_{x}; the greatest irreversible or loss component occurs when the product of σxand λsalong the magnetizing axis (x) is negative, increasing when major easy axes make large angles withx."
"Two alternate attraction magnetic suspension systems are discussed on a magnetic performance basis, as well as on their lift-to-weight (L/W) capabilities. On an equal current basis, the lower reluctance, flat track configuration has higher lift force and betterL/Wthan the U-shaped track configuration with its larger leakage flux. With equal magnetization (unequal currents) and low guidance forces (F_{G}/F_{L} \\leq 0.3), the U-shaped track has a higherL/Wratio, but both attraction systems suffer from lowL/Wwhen all elements of the suspension system are considered."
"Dynamic properties of the weak ferromagnet FeBO3were investigated. The dependence of resonance absorption χ\" on the angle between the easy plane of magnetizations and the RF field is shown. The calculation of the frequency dependence of the resonant precession modes for the low- and high-frequency branch is presented. Experimental results for the low-frequency branch show good agreement with theory."
"The origin of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in rocks is discussed both in terms of types and carriers of NRM. The importance of the concept of pseudo-single domain (PSD) grains as carriers of stable remanences is underscored. Recent advances in rock magnetism and paleomagnetism have helped to understand (a) continental motions which took place in the first 4 billion years of the earth's life, (b) fine details of field fluctuations both during \"normal\" times as well as during a geomagnetic field reversal, and (c) indicate the magnitudes of the fields present during the formation of the moon and of the early solar system."
"The distribution of magnetizationMin T and I elements at various orientations and values of external magnetic fieldHwas investigated. It has been discovered that there is a strong mutual influence of adjacent bars on the distribution ofMin T- and I-bars. Direct observations of the magnetization distribution in the I-bar in the presence of bubble field were performed."
"Iron is sputtered reactively in an argon-oxygen glow discharge to form deposits of magnetite. Cycling the oxygen partial pressure between a low and a high value during sputtering causes deposition of alternating layers of Fe-metal and Fe2O3-oxide. Depending on the cycle length, a layered structure results or homogeneous films form. For all films pronounced magnetite peaks were found by X-ray analysis. In the case of homogeneous films only magnetite was found. The films were hard-magnetic with coercivities between 250 Oe and 550 Oe and squarenesses between 0.6 and 0.8. Magnetic recording of these films on 14-in disks yielded bit-densities of up to 6.5 kT/cm."
"The selection and preparation of bubble domain materials is discussed in the light of materials requirements for bubble domain memories. The history of bubble domain materials development is outlined with emphasis on the discovery and exploitation of two types of materials, magnetic garnets and amorphous magnetic alloys. It is shown how the great compositional flexibility of the garnet system has led to many garnet choices for device use without imposing undue hardship on the materials developer and supplier, and how liquid phase epitaxy of garnet films is a simple way of providing reproducibly films that meet device requirements. Amorphous magnetic alloys are discussed with emphasis on Gd-Co-Mo compositions. In the search for small bubble materials, it is pointed out that both garnets and amorphous alloys have limitations. In the former case,qwill usually be too low and in the latter case, the drift of properties with temperature may be unacceptable."

"The Transfilter is a combination of a leakage-reactance magnetic structure and a capacitor, which is interposed between an ac thyristor voltage controller and the load, to filter the load current, to provide current-source characteristics, and to act as an isolation and impedance-level transformer. The Transfilter was originally developed to provide sinewave adjustable current up to 50 A at 60 Hz for an automatic power-system-relay tester."
"Magnetic recovery of pyritic sulphur and coal from mine rejects has been envisaged as a two-step sequence of processes. 1) A thermal decomposition of the mixture rich in pyrites at about 700°C which produces a magnetic pyrrhotite and liberates sulphur; 2) air transport of the solid product into a high-gradient magnetic separator to separate coal from the minerals. Analysis is made of results reported separately on the kinetics of thermal decomposition of pyrites, carried out in thermo-balance, and on the wet slurry magnetic processing of coals. A suggestion is made to pursue sulphur recovery from coal mine rejects by using a proposed all-dry fluidized bed process, after the previous effort of other authors on dry magnetic processing of pyrites mentioned in the literature. This suggestion is the principal aim of this work."
"Allowing for the magnetic noise damping effect, characteristic changes in the noise spectrum between 1.5-100 kHz are investigated as a function of magnetizing frequency, and corresponding damping-corrected power spectra are outlined. A Systematic comparison is carried out between high-frequency noise characteristics and properties of a low-alloy steel sheet quality, the dependence found being more or less fortuitous."
"The purpose is to make clear the fundamental physical nature of the Invar problem, disregarding its details. After a brief discussion of the practical applications of the Invar alloys, the large magnetovolume effects and the anomalous magnetic properties are reviewed. The basic ideas of the various interpretations of the Invar effects, as well as the microscopic properties of the Invar alloys, are summarized. The physical background of the Elinvar alloys is also presented. Recent observations of Invar-type effects in new materials suggest that the Invar effect is rather common in itinerant ferro- and antiferromagnets."
"A new simple and accurate ac demagnetizing method for high permeability cores is presented. In this method, a linear inductance is connected in parallel with the winding of the core to stabilize the level ofBHminor loops at zero flux level during the whole process of ac demagnetization. The ac demagnetization error is suppressed to less than 0.5% even in 50% Ni-Fe cores. The optimal ac demagnetizing time is longer than 0.5 sec., and the optimal ac demagnetizing waveform of current source is sinusoidal. Experimentally, high demagnetizing accuracy was obtained over a frequency range of 10 Hz-2 kHz. Two cores with the same dimensions and materials are simultaneously ac demagnetized by means of a linear inductance connected in parallel with the primary windings of two cores connected series-aiding, whose secondary windings are connected parallel-opposing and short circuited; thus, the remanent flux level after ac demagnetization is nondestructively detected by destructive readout in other core. This ac demagnetizing method is useful for measuring some magnetic properties such as initial permeability and BH curves and for resetting the small-signal transformer cores and second-harmonic analog memory elements."
"High gradient magnetic separation is a new technique which provides a practical means for separating weakly paramagnetic materials down to colloidal particle size on a large scale and at flow rates one hundred times faster than conventional filtration. It is based on the use of matrices of finely divided filamentary ferromagnetic material containing 95% void space, such as steel wool, subjected to strong magnetic fields generated bysophisticated magnets of a type not previously used for magnetic separation. HGMS was developed in the late sixties by MIT, Sala Magnetics and the Huber Company, and has been used since then for the purification of kaolin. The technique is of importance to the entire chemical and mineral industry, and in the treatment of water and sewage, but its application in other areas has been delayed by lack of interdisciplinary communication. What is needed at present is a better understanding of the mechanism of HGMS to permit a more scientific approach to future applications, and more inducement to the firms which are currently developing the next generation of hardware. Other approaches to magnetic separation also merit more serious attention, particularly those based on open gradient rather than matrix structures. New magnet technology developed in conjunction with HGMS and the advent of superconductivity make available field strengths, gradients and volumes at least an order of magnitude above those offered by the prior art. Such magnetic fields have potential value beyond their use in magnetic separation inasmuch as they are likely to affect the kinetics of many chemical reactions, very probably also those involved in the combustion process itself."
 "An entirely new level of magnetic filtration technology was put into full commercial production by the kaolin industry of Georgia, U.S.A. during 1973 - 1975. At present, five kaolin producers in Georgia are operating large magnetic filters each capable of producing over 4000 liters of kaolin slurry per minute or over 60 tons of kaolin per hour on a dry basis. When operated at the 4000 liters per minute rate, these five large magnetic filters have a combined capacity approximating the entire waterwashed coating and filler kaolin produced in the U.S."
"Recent developments in the direct reduction of iron ore and recent growth in its application stimulated the investigation of direct lignite reduction of Alabama brown ore. Essentially complete reduction followed by sufficient agglomeration of the reduced iron was achieved so that grinding followed by magnetic separation appears feasible. The finely divided iron should be especially amenable to high gradient magnetic separation. Initial efforts with a crude electromagnet were promising, but reoxidation of the iron was a problem with the high gradient system."
"The basic cryogenic engineering requirements for building a superconducting magnet system for the magnetic separation of minerals are considered. The different construction problems for solenoids and non-circular coils are considered. The solution adopted is epoxy impregnation with high density glass-fibre inserted to control the difference in expansion coefficient between epoxy resins and the winding material of the superconducting magnet. The short hold-time cryostat required for preliminary measurements is described and proposals made for a small scale pilot plant machine with continuous refrigeration."

The input/output features of the system are designed to facilitate its integration into any particular design process through a conversational language. A new approach to force calculation is presented together with reactance expressions in terms of finite element matrix notations.

  "High extraction magnetic filters combine high gradient features of the Frantz FerrofilterR, high intensity concepts of the Jones separators, and principles of modern magnet design derived from high energy physics research. Evolution of high extraction magnetic filters used commercially by all major kaolin producers is reviewed and new trends in equipment are highlighted."
"A theoretical analysis of edge effects is presented for the problem of a stationary plate having unequal overhangs and subjected to a traveling flux wave. The solution represents an extension of the work due to Russell and Norsworthy, wherein the overhangs were assumed to be of equal width. Since the model considered here is a general one, the results of this study should be applicable to the design and optimization of various practical devices, e.g., disk rotor eddy current brakes, vertical linear induction motors with unequal overhangs."
"Using data readily available from manufacturers on standard magnetic-material properties and standard core sizes for air gap type cores, an algorithm designed for a computer solution is developed which optimally determines the air gap length and locates the quiescent point on the normal magnetization curve so as to yield an inductor design with the minimum number of turns for a given ac voltage and frequency and with a given dc bias current superimposed in the same winding. Magnetic-material data used in the design are the normal magnetization curve and a family of incremental permeability curves. A second procedure, which requires a simpler set of calculations, starts from an assigned quiescent point on the normal magnetization curve and first screens candidate core sizes for suitability, then determines the required turns and air gap length."
"This paper presents the results of pilot-scale studies of sulfur and ash removal from coal by high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS). Work was done on both the liquefied coal and the raw pulverized coal in water slurries. The effects of residence time, field intensity, packing material and density, slurry concentration and recycle on the grade and recovery of the wet separation of sulfur and ash from water slurries of Illinois No. 6 coal were quantitatively examined. The HGMS was effective in reducing the weight percent of total sulfur, ash, and inorganic sulfur by as high as 40, 35, and 80%, respectively; while achieving a maximum recovery of about 95%. The results have also provided the first experimental verification of the applicability of Bean's magnetic filtration model in quantitatively correlating the data obtained from the pilot-scale beneficiation of coal slurries by the HGMS. The successful verification of the model allows one to quantitatively identify the trade-off of operating parameters so as to optimize the magnetic removal of sulfur and ash. A pilot-scale HGMS system for the magnetic sedation of mineral residue from the liquefied coal has been designed and constructed. Typical results from preliminary experiments with the liquefied solvent refined coal (SRC) have been quite encouraging, indicating that the HGMS was effective in reducing the total sulfur and ash contents by as high as 70 and 76%, respectively. Finally, the liquefaction of the magnetically treated Kentucky No. 9/14 coal was studied and compared with that of the untreated coal. It was found that although the mineral matters which had been removed magnetically had a significant catalytic effect on the liquefaction behavior, the organic hydrodesulfurization remained practically the same for both the untreated and treated coals. This suggests that the magnetic removal of mineral matters prior to liquefaction may be advantageous for the SRC and other related liquefaction processes, in which the minimum hydrogenation is especially desired and the hydrodesulfurization is often limiting."
"A high gradient magnetic separator consists of a region of a high and approximately uniform magnetic field and a ferromagnetic matrix of fine wires which distort the field and produce large local gradients. As a particle is carried through the separator by a carrying fluid, both magnetic forces and drag forces are exerted on it. In order to gain insight into the capture mechanism, the drag and magnetic forces on a spherical paramagnetic particle were examined. The equilibrium of these forces defines the path of the particle as it passes by a matrix element. It is shown that for any geometry the particle motion is a function of two dimensionless variables. A computer with a plotter was used to compute the particle paths. In order to provide for most flexibility the magnetic field is that of a magnetized elliptical cylinder with any orientation with respect to the background field and flow stream, while the flow velocities are those corresponding to another elliptical cylinder of different configuration and orientation which allows computation of the change of capture cross section as the matrix element collects material. Examples of particle orbits and changes of capture cross section are given inthe paper for various aspect ratios of the original matrix element."
"Magnetic fields, or regions of a magnetic field have been termed isodynamic, katadynamic or anadynamic. Force constant in magnitude throughout an isodynamic field region has proved useful in concentrating particles according to slight differences in magnetic susceptibilities. In the kata-dynamic field region the highest gradients of magnetic intensity, and consequently the greatest magnetic force can be applied to a particle. The anadynamic magnetic field region, in which the force on a particle decreases in magnitude in the direction in which field intensity increases, functions in creating a magnetic barrier at which particles of low paramagnetic or diamagnetic susceptibility can be separated. The work of S.G. Frantz Co., Inc. has been concentrated since it was founded some 40 years ago in the development and manufacture of magnetic separation equipment for mineral investigation and for industrial processing. The teaching of the Company's founder, the late Samuel G. Frantz is fundamental to today's art of magnetic separation."
"An expression is presented which relates the print-through of a magnetic tape at the optimum recorded wavelength to a constant plus 10 logarithm of (retentivity times coating thickness/base film thickness). The constant is obtained from print-through measurements on several magnetic tapes made with a gamma ferric oxide."
"The basic requirements for high gradient, high intensity magnetic separation are reviewed and process limitations are emphasized. The principle innovations of the superconducting magnet system design for this work include an annular quadrupole magnet and corresponding slurry channel operating in an open field without secondary poles. The transverse secondary circulation set up in the slurry through the primary orbital flow is used to transport all particles into the region of high field intensity. Two Pennsylvania coals with high pyrite contents were treated. Test conditions and results are described and discussed. One of the coals yielded 81% recovery of \"clean\" coal and over 85% rejection of pyrite. Possible further improvements are discussed."
"Estimates of magnetic separation characteristics, conceptual process requirements, and capital costs for magnetic separation of mineral sulfur from liquid coal produced in a solvent refining process have been determined from preliminary empirical data obtained by Hydrocarbon Research, Incorporated, in a laboratory program sponsored by EPRI. The magnetic separator has been scaled to remove weakly magnetic sulfurous minerals from the process stream of a solvent refining plant fed by 9,072 metric tons (10,000 short tons) of raw coal per day whose product (moisture and ash-free solvent refined coal plus distillates plus undissolved carbon plus ash) meets point source sulfur emission standards for new installations burning coal. The conceptual installation, employing four batch type high-field high-gradient magnetic separators, each with 3.1 M3magnetized volume, packed to 94% void volume with fine stainless steel wool, and energized by a 2 T magnetic field, processes a stream of 315 liters/sec (5,000 gal/minute) reactor liquid effluent. The flow velocity through each unit is 1.8 cm/sec (27 GPM/ft2) with a 74% on line factor. The installation processes 3.31 million tons per year of raw coal, or 2.9 million tons per year of desulfurized product. Cost of installed magnets is estimated at $18 million and the add on processing costs associated with magnetic separation (including O&M) are estimated at $1.01 per ton of coal feed, $1.16 per ton of low sulfur product (4 cents per million Btu), and 33 cents per 1,000 liters of reactor effluent filtered ($1.27 per 1,000 gallons)."
"This paper presents the results of test work performed with a Pacific Electric Motors (PEM) high intensity magnetic separator (20 kilogauss), a unit capable of separating weakly, as well as strongly, magnetic minerals in the particle size range of sands to clays. Tests were performed on selected industrial minerals and two Indiana coals. With some minerals excellent separations were attained and with others intermediate and poor separations were accomplished. This study is a preliminary survey and many of the intermediate and poor results can be improved as separation problems are worked out with additional test work."
"The force balance equation describing the motion of a small paramagnetic particle near a cylindrical ferromagnetic collector is presented in general form. The capture cross-section for a particle approaching a bare wire is found to be a function of the coefficient of magnetic force and the magnetization of the cylinder. Calculations show that the assumption of potential flow versus creeping flow is a critical one which can change the capture cross-section by as much as a factor of three."
"A rate equation is being developed to model the buildup of single-sized, weakly magnetic particles on a single ferromagnetic cylindrical wire. The equation relates the rate of buildup on the wire to the fraction of the incoming particles that are captured and the portion of the particles that are carried away by the fluid stream. The theoretical predictions and experimental results generally agree well for a range of field values, flow rates, and particle concentrations. A more accurate model of the collection process will enable development of more accurate models for arrays and entire filters."
"In previous publications the performance of a high field-high gradient magnetic filter was calculated using a particle trajectory model to obtain the capture cross section of the fibers. The configuration of the particle buildup was assumed to be constant without considering the forces on the particle after impinging on the fiber. We now calculate the equilibrium configuration of particle buildup on the edge of a flat ribbon considering only the magnetic and viscous forces and including the effect of the fluid boundary layer. The configurations obtained as a function of field and flow are consistent with the few approximate direct observations reported in the literature. The performance of the filter, calculated using the particle trajectory model, now modified by this equilibrium buildup configuration, is compared to previously reported experimental results on separation of CuO from Al2O3slurries. A somewhat better fit is now obtained over the entire range of fluid velocity and fields, but an adjustable parameter affecting the viscous drag on the collected particles is required."
"Magnetogravimetric, magnetohydrostatic, and magnetohydrodynamic separation techniques can be classified as magnetic separations of the second kind. Magnetic separation of the first kind (ordinary magnetic separation) relies on the inherent magnetic susceptibility of the material to be separated. When the medium of separation rather than the separated particles is made magnetizable, a new system of gravity separations can result (magnetic separation of the second kind). In magnetogravimetry, a colloidal solution of a ferro- or ferrimagnetic substance (magnetic fluid) acts as the separation medium. Magnetohydrostatic separations are conducted in an aqueous solution (or melt) of a strongly paramagnetic salt. Magnetohydrodynamics applies the Faraday effect (mutual orthogonality of the force thrust, electric, and magnetic fields) on suspended conducting minerals in an electrolytic solution placed in crossed electric and magnetic fields. The first technique was pioneered mainly in the United States, while the last two techniques were pioneered by Bunin and Andres in the Soviet Union and introduced to the West by Andres. The principles underlying the three separation techniques will be discussed."

It also covers the use of \"wet drum separators\" in the recovery of magnetite from heavy media plants. Selection criteria are discussed."
"This paper discusses key technical and economical achievements which have extended the range of application of magnetic separation methods into the commercial processing of micron size feebly magnetic materials. Commercial application of magnetic methods in the cleaning of kaolin clay is reviewed and a discussion of magnetic separation principles is given with emphasis on identification and utilization of important process parameters. Possible future developments in magnetic processing of municipal and industrial wastewaters and of applications of magnetic methods to the preparation of clean fuels from coal are discussed."
"A new non-polluting process for the desulfurization of coal is proposed. The process which consists of a short low-temperature roast in an inert atmosphere, followed by magnetic separation, is expected to produce coal containing approximately one-third of its initial sulfur content, coal chemicals, elemental sulfur and a solid waste product that contains large amounts of sulfur, iron and to a lesser extent coal. A flow chart and energy balance for the possible process and preliminary experimental results from a laboratory scale model are presented."
"Our preliminary experience with using commercially available High Gradient Magnetic Separation (HGMS) instrumentation in water treatment problems is described. Water effluents from both a refinery and a chemical sewer have been used with flocculants to reduce total suspended solids and oil content."
"Inorganic sulfur and ash-forming mineral matter have been removed from solvent-refined coal by high gradient magnetic separation at temperatures up to 587°F. Reduction in sulfur and ash content is temperature dependent and is correlated with the H/v ratio."
"A simple model is formulated to determine the effect of temperature on the filtering ability of HGMS devices. An optimum temperature range is observed to exist for which the capture of ash-forming minerals and inorganic sulfur in liquid coal is at a maximum. Model will serve as a framework for analyzing experimental data in future. In the past, some pertinent, independent variables such as particle size, slurry velocity and applied magnetic field which affect the performance of HGMS de-Vices, have somewhat been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The effects of these important variables have been well established. A program is currently underway at the M.I.T. Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory to study the applicability of HGMS to products from coal liquefaction processes. As part of this program, the effect of temperature on the performance of filtering ash-forming mineral impurities and inorganic sulfur from liquefied coal is being explored. This introduces an additional variable- temperature -which is to be investigated among other relevant variables of the system. In particular, by varying the operating temperature the trade-off, between the lowering of the viscosity of the fluid as the temperature is increased and the attendant decrease in the magnetization of magnetic particles, is to be studied. In view of these considerations, a simple model has been formulated to predict the effect of temperature on the filtering ability of HGMS devices."
"It is suggested that operating conditions of coal liquefaction could be optimized to enhance the formation of magnetic pyrrhotite to facilitate removal of sulfur from liquefied coal by magnetic separation. Some results and discrepancies on the hydrogenation of pyrite are reported."
"Low disparity block codes should find use in recording digital waveforms at high bit-packing densities approaching 33 000 b/in per track. Comparative tests indicate that some fairly-easy-to-implement block codes surpass the delay modulation code in bit error rate performance."
"Thermomagnetic studies of Pennsylvanian coals and associated roof shales indicate that hematite and minor goethite are present as ferrimagnetic phases, in addition to the paramagnetic mineral pyrite. Laboratory studies show that the carrier of the stable natural magnetic remanence (NRM) is mainly single domain hematite. X-ray diffraction studies of the samples has directly identified illite, kaolinite and minor amounts of chlorite as the natural suite of clay minerals typical in coal and overclay. Mössbauer spectroscopy identifies hematite and geothite as ferrimagnetic phases within the clay structures. Thermomagnetic studies at higher temperatures show that paramagnetic pyrite is converted to ferrimagnetic hematite through a strongly ferromagnetic phase maghemite. This transition occurs within the 400-500°C temperature interval and results in a significant increase in the ferrimagnetic polarization and paramagnetic susceptibility of the samples."
"In this paper, the recent development and current status of the magnetic removal of sulfur and ash from dry, wet and liquefied coals are critically reviewed and analyzed. A quantitative assessment of the scientific, technical and economical feasibility of applying magnetic separation to the desulfurization and deashing of coals is presented. The needs and opportunities in the future research and development work are also suggested."
"This high intensity, high gradient, cyclic magnetic separator has the magnetic field and the wash water path tranverse to the feed slurry flow path. This allows the length of the slurry flow path to be independently selected without effecting the magnetizing force (ampere-turns). The length of the flow path of wash water (for regenerating the magnetic matrix) can also be independently selected without affecting the length of the feed slurry flow path. Since the selection of each of these parameters can be made independently, it is possible to optimize each parameter for each particular application."
"Particles suspended in a fluid carrier are separated by first, grading into fractions of equal settling rates and, second, separating the equal settling particles according to their magnetic susceptibilities. The particulate sample to be separated is passed through a two-path parallel flow system. In one path, the sample is selectively graded, by elutriation into equal-settling fractions. Each such fraction then flows directly to the second path, where it passes through an isodynamic magnetic field at a velocity proportional to its settling rate. Such proportionality between settling velocity and flow velocity provides a residence time which ensures that the degree of deflection, recovery of the more magnetic particles, on the one hand and the less magnetic particles on the other hand, will be attained within the active length of the magnetic field."
"The basic characteristic of superconducting magnets is the ability to generate high magnetic fields using compact windings and essentially no power. Their basic advantage is to generate higher fields in configurations that are more open and provide more room for associated piping. The higher fields can be utilized to increase the effectiveness of separation, to separate more weakly paramagnetic or smaller particles, or to operate at high fluid velocity. The general state of the art of superconducting magnets is reviewed briefly, and specific examples of the use of superconducting magnets for magnetic separation is given. These examples will show that for the same performance the velocity can be increased by almost an order of magnitude along with an increase in magnetic field. Superconducting magnets are only now beginning to be used in the field of magnetic separation, and their future use will be considerable."
 "Data are presented on the temperature dependence (from ∼ 0°C to 120°C) of the magnetization, characteristic length, and uniaxial anisotropy constant in LPE films of Y1.5Gd0.8Eu0.7Fe4.3Al0.6Ga0.1O12, Y1.0Gd1.0Er1.0Fe4.5Al0.3Ga0.2O12, Y0.9Gd1.5Yb0.6Fe4.5Al0.5O12, Y1.0Gd1.0Tm1.0Fe4.4Ga0.6O12, Y1.1Gd0.8Tm1.1Fe4.4Ga0.6O12, and Y1.2Gd0.6Tm1.2Fe4.4Ga0.6O12, Included are samples having a range of strain- and growth-induced anisotropies. We find that the magnetization can readily be made temperature independent from ∼20 to ∼100°C in these materials but that Ku, and hencel, has a negative temperature coefficient. The variation of Kuwith temperature has an approximately exponential variation in all samples."
 "Particles can be separated according to their mass magnetic susceptibilities by using a magnetic energy gradient barrier. When a stream of particles with different magnetic susceptibilities is fed to the barrier at an angle, a continuous separation can be obtained. The particles having susceptibilities higher than a predetermined value are deflected and guided by the magnetic barrier to a releasing region, where they pass through the barrier. Particles with lower susceptibilities which penetrate the barrier follow a different path from the more magnetic fraction and are separately collected."
"Recent investigations of a relatively new magnetic levitation device are described. This device uses an electromagnet, which is the inductive part of a resonant circuit. If the circuit is properly tuned, static stability is attainable. Levitators built on these lines are simple and reliable. However, it is already well known that a tuned circuit electromagnet on its own is usually not sufficient to maintain levitation for long periods of time, and the suspended object tends to be dynamically unstable. This dynamic instability is prevented by introducing simple electronic or mechanical modifications into the tuned circuit system. Such modifications are described and their investigation is dealt with. The electronic method of stabilization is successfully analyzed by employing the viewpoint of slowly varying quantities. It is believed that the present article is the first to suggest mechanical methods for introducing dynamic stabilization to levitators. It is interesting that mechanical stabilization is achieved without a necessity of employing direct mechanical contact, and the levitated object is suspended freely. The system is stabilized by electromechanically coupling an aluminium solid object to the main levitator circuit."
"The commercial development of high gradient magnetic separation began in 1969 when the first industrial, cyclic high gradient magnetic separators were sold to the J.M. Huber Corporation by Magnetic Engineering Associates, Sala's predecessor, for processing high grade paper coating clays. Since that time, high gradient magnetic separation for the processing of high quality clays has come to be fully accepted in the United States kaolin industry. A number of large cyclic separators of the Sala design, with capacity ratings above 60 tph have been constructed under license from Sala and installed in major U.S. clay producers' facilities. Applications of high gradient magnetic separation technology to mineral processing and water treatment have been explored(1,2,3,4). The cyclic high gradient magnetic separators utilized in the clay industry may be employed for most water treatment applications since the volume of magnetic material to be removed is a relatively small percentage of the total flow volume through the machine. In the majority of mineral separation and beneficiation problems, the feed percentage of magnetics is more than 1 to 2 percent and to solve this problem efficiently a continuous high gradient magnetic separator has been developed by us. A 15 tph continuous pilot separator is now operating in our Cambridge pilot plant and is able to process ores with the effectiveness of the cyclic high gradient magnetic separators."
"A magnetic separator is described which employs a superconducting quadrupole magnet. The magnet is installed in a vertical cylindrical cryostat with hollow central portion. The magnetic forces are substantially in the radial direction. The results of trial experiments are described with various configurations of mineral slurries and wash water streams. In the preferred configuration, mineral slurry travels around the outer circumference of the cryostat and is subject to both a powerful magnetic field and a swirling action of the flow due to secondary circulation in the channel. Separation results for a single pass of a chromite silicate mixture are presented. The separator with superconducting coils is able to offer important advantages in treating ores of both finer size and lower magnetic susceptibility than conventional machines."
"Small media defects are a major limitation to data reliability at high magnetic recording densities. One way of overcoming this limitation is to use an error correction code. In this paper, Pulse-Compression Recording (PCR) is proposed as a method in which the energy of each data bit is spatially dispersed in such a manner that the recorded information is insensitive to small media defects or short bursts of noise."
"A fast-access, non-volatile memory system using 3- μm bubble 80-kbit chips has been designed for an experimental model and evaluated from a systems viewpoint. The goal of this project is to investigate from both the side of technology and cost if the memories built with major-minor organized 3 μm bubble chips are acceptable in the commercial market. This paper describes the practical design of a bubble memory system, with a capacity of 8-Mbits and an average access time of approximately 1 ms at drive frequencies of up to 500 kHz, which involves memory system organization, redundancy design using chips with excess minor loops, packaging, electronic circuits scheme and other considerations. The results of the experiment and the system cost estimate based on this design are also described."
"A two-mask level, conductor first thin film process is described for fabrication of magnetic bubble devices. The process permits a stepless permalloy level over a conductor that may be two to three times as thick as conventional processing The planar process is attained by anodizing a thick aluminum alloy film in all regions where no conductor is needed. The process described solves problems in conventional processing caused by thin conductor metalization and permalloy step coverage. Replication, nucleation, and annihilation devices made with this process promise superior performance."
"The crosstie memory stores information in magnetic domain walls in permalloy films about 350 Å thick. The domain walls are also used as shift register tracks. Serrated edges on narrow thin film permalloy strips are used to center a domain wall in each strip and to provide stable positions for crossties and Bloch lines. A magnetoresistance detector uses the same information bearing permalloy film as the magnetoresistive element. The entire crosstie memory can be fabricated on a silicon wafer or chip using conventional photolithographic procedures as are used in fabricating integrated circuits. Thus, a magnetic memory can be combined with semiconductor drivers, decoders, and sense amplifiers on the same chip. The memory is intended to serve as a block oriented random access memory (BORAM). Important background information such as static and dynamic stability conditions, Bloch line mobility, propagation and observation techniques are reviewed. Also, design goals and the role such device is expected to play in memory technology are presented. Anticipated performance includes a shift rate of 20 × 106bits/sec, a bit density greater than 1.5 × 105bits/cm2, an operating temperature range from -50 °C to 100 °C, nonvolatility, low cost, and low power consumption."
"Closed-form normalized expressions for the field components inside a single-layer rectangular solenoid are derived from a model in which the solenoid is approximated by finite length current sheets of infinitesimal thickness. The equations are extended by superposition to include the case of a multi-layered solenoid, and the effects of nearby magnetic materials are included by employing the method of images. Computer generated field plots compare favorably with measured data."
"In the overlay films used for bubble domain propagation circuitry elastic energy is stored. Some of this energy is transferred to the LPE garnet film and because of the magnetoelastic coupling, significant alterations can be caused in the uniaxial anisotropy, Ku. The amount of elastic energy stored in the overlay is typically proportional to the product of the film stress and the film thickness. The elastic energy transferred to the garnet film is via surface tractions at the interface of the garnet and the overlay films. By assuming as boundary conditions that these surface tractions are uniform underneath the overlay and zero outside of the overlay boundaries, it has been possible to calculate from elasticity theory the stress distribution in the garnet film and substrate.The results show that the most severe alterations in Kuoccur at the edges of the overlay. Underneath the overlay the changes in Kuare less severe."
"We calculated an eddy current loss in a wire as a function of an applied ac field. Estimating the field at an actual coil wire and summing the losses in all points of wires we obtained a formula representing a coil loss. Based on the calculated results, we designed coils which drive thirty-two 64 kb chips. The observed loss of the coils was in good accord with the calculated one. This 2 Mb module was operated at 40 Oe rotation field of 500 kHz with the coil loss of 8 W."
"A description is given of the fabrication conditions and magnetic properties of electroplated permalloy for bubble circuits. Propagation and detection elements are grown in stencils delineated in the resist. The plating base is a thin Cr-Cu layer which is chemically etched. A 2% magnetoresistive ratio is obtained with the 12% Fe composition yielding signals of 1 mV/mA. Propagation margins and detection signals are comparable to those given by circuits fabricated by vacuum deposition methods."
"The investigation of implantation conditions for bubble propagation points to the necessity for a minimum dose (1.5 \\times 10^{16}ions cm2) and a sufficiently thick profile (0.4 μ). The use of flat profiles gives uniform implanted layers and allows values of the maximum defect concentration far away from the amorphization threshold. Unlike in permalloy circuits, bubble stability and bias field margins do not increase with the drive field. The propagation is not critically dependent upon disk diameter and spacing."
"A study has been made of the probability of error as a function of bias field near the edges of the propagation margin on the minor loops of an experimental magnetic bubble circuit using a computer controlled test apparatus. At the high bias edge of the margin, failure is dominated by the number of times the rotating field is turned off and on. Application of a constant in-plane field in any direction did not improve margins on this circuit. The probability of failure per bubble per operation can be described by a normal probability distribution in contrast to the exponential distribution others have used. This implies that margins decrease more slowly than linearly with the logarithm of the number of operations. At the low bias edge of the margin the transition from reliable operation is sharper, does not depend on the number of times the rotating field is turned off, and is consistent with a flat margin edge as the number of operations increases."
"A generalized field interruption technique is evaluated for bubble memory chip margin analysis. Using a short bubble stream and measuring the averaged propagation steps for the first error in a given data pattern, field interruption offers a statistically significant measurement of the failure probability for a small segment of a complete bubble memory device. This technique also allows an individual component margin measurement independent of the rest of the device. A practical example is given using a 100K bit serial loop memory chip which is composed of various components and which also contains a weak processing defect. The component margin measurements show that at low driving fields the chip operation is limited by the passive replicator component, while at high driving fields operation is limited by the permalloy defect."
"The range of bubble-bubble interactions on the major loop was determined from studies in which a 157 bit bubble train was circulated around the major loop at a bias field selected to collapse most of the bubbles within about 12 hours of continuous operation. The progress of the decay of the bubble train was monitored by replicating and reading once every 500 major loop rotations. A comparison of two successive reads provided discrimination against soft errors. The bit sequence was printed each time a hard error was encountered. Short range order parameters were used to determine staistically whether the collapsed bubbles were randomly positioned. Bubbles initially spaced two periods apart exhibited short range order during the decay. However, in similar experiments with bubbles initially spaced four periods apart, a random decay was observed. It was thus concluded that there is bubble-bubble interaction on the major loop with a range of two to three periods."
"The static and dynamic properties of bubbles can be conveniently observed by using a mirror overlay between a drive structure and a thin ferro-garnet film. This method was applied to studies of bubble propagation in T-bar, T-X and chevron permalloy drive structures. The results of the study lead to the conclusion that a parameter a should be introduced for estimating the nonuniformity of bubble propagation. This parameter is found by photometric measurements of light intensity variations along the bubble propagation path over the structure period λ and by subsequent calculations."
"Calculations have been made of interactions and fields in two-dimensional periodic arrays of I-bars. The results of the study shed light on several questions of interactions among bubble propagation elements. We have calculated interaction effects in arrays of I-bars as a function of both longitudinal and transverse spacing between bars. Three different geometries of I-bar show similar effects; the transverse and longitudinal interactions have opposing signs and are stronger in the transverse direction. We also have calculated local and average fields for an array of I-bars of geometries chosen to facilitate comparison with recent measurements. The local field in the gap between elements is found to be highly nonuniform but with an average value that obeys a simple relationship as the gap length is varied. The field profile is also nonuniform in the transverse direction, and exhibits a proximity enhancement that depends upon gap dimension. These results support the interpretation that bar-bar interactions can influence the magnetization in propagation arrays."
"Observational results for bubble motion at high frequencies in field-accessed devices have been reported in the literature. The predictions of a model for bubble propagation under T-bar tracks are compared with these results for a frequency of 100 kHz, initially at midrange values of drive and bias fields. This comparison is helpful in refining certain features of the model so as to bring its assumptions nearer to the physical situation. The matching between predicted and observed results for the variation of bubble position with drive field angle is now much improved. The refined model is then used to calculate results at other values of drive and bias fields for which experimental data is available. The agreement between theory and practice is shown to be quite close except when the bias field is high."
"Exchange coupling has been studied on fine particles of Co with 35 at.% Ni which are surface oxidized to have an antiferromagnetic Co-Ni monoxide shell. Cooling a sample in the state of remanence through the Néel-temperature of the monoxide, a hysteresis loop is observed which is shifted along the field axis. A field of loop displacement is defined with respect to remanence coercivity as\\Delta H_{R}=(H_{+R}- H_{-R})/2. It is found to be quantitatively equivalent to an external field in the anhysteretic magnetization process which occurs if a superimposed alternating field is slowly decreased to zero from a large initial value. An universal curve is obtained by plottingM_{ar}(0)/M_{r}(\\infin), the normalized anhysteretic remanent magnetization in zero external field, as a function of\\Delta H_{R} \\chi_{ar}/M_{r}(\\infin), where\\chi_{ar}is the anhysteretic susceptibility atM_{ar}(H)=0andM_{r}(\\infin)is the saturation remanent magnetization. The curve is valid for all combinations of\\Delta H_{R},\\chi_{ar}andM_{r} (\\infin). The consequences for recording on a tape containing the above particles are discussed."
"This paper explores some aspects of the erasure of signals from magnetic recording media. The first part gives the erasure characteristics for several different types of materials in current use for magnetic recording. A novel method of displaying the results shows that γ-Fe2O3and Cobaloy metal alloy particles behave substantially the same, while CrO2and Co-doped gamma ferric oxide are different from them and from each other. The second part explores anomalous signal recurrence after complete erasure. It is shown that under certain conditions of storage a non-magnetic memory of the signal is left on the tape. This signal can be converted back to the magnetic form and measured, although its level is quite low. It is subsequently posible on most tapes to remove the non-magnetic signal. The plausibility of the \"non-magnetic signal\" hypothesis is supported by calculations of the expected level which are of the same order of magnitude as the levels actually measured."
"Measurements as a function of temperature t were performed on directional FeSi 3%, in order to study the possible influence on the power loss anomalies of a change of intrinsic parameters, such as crystalline anisotropy energy K, without affecting the extrinsic ones, such as grain size and orientation. Power losses per cycle P/f were measured vs. frequency f, between d. c. and 50 Hz at various temperatures ranging from 25 to 650°C. The variation of K and of saturation induction Bswith t were also determined up to the Curie point by means of a torque magnetometer. The results show that the excess loss anomaly at 50 Hz, measured by the ratio of experimental to classical eddy-current loss, and the non-linearity anomaly, determined from the renormalized P/f vs. f curves, are essentially independent of t. Analogies with the temperature dependence of the power density spectrum of the Barkhausen noise, which varies according to aB_{s}^{2} (t)law, are briefly discussed. These results seem to indirectly stress the role of extrinsic parameters in determining the anomalous loss behaviors in directional FeSi 3%. Kerr observations made up to 350°C on a (300 × 30)mm2strip did not detect any change of stripe domain widths and patterns."
"This paper is concerned with the theoretical behaviour of the linear synchronous motor as a propulsion means for a high speed vehicle. The performance during acceleration and steady state operation is obtained from a set of state variable equations which are solved using a digital computer. The inherent performance is oscillatory with little damping. A general feedback control scheme is presented which provides damping and control of the force angle (the angle between the vehicle field and track field). Velocity and force angle errors control voltage magnitude and frequency of the power conditioner (cycloconverter). The effectiveness of the control scheme is measured in terms of its ability to have the vehicle follow a velocity profile, to maintain a constant force angle and to eliminate fast changes in the cycloconverter output voltage. The study shows that effective damping and control of the force angle can be obtained when the cycloconverter voltage and frequency are simultaneously controlled by velocity and force angle feedback signals."
 "This paper describes a new inverter configuration in which all thyristors are simultaneously commutated by means of a single transformer coupled commutation stage. This results in improved compactness, simplicity, and reliability with respect to existing configurations. The proposed inverter configuration also offers the following features: a) Rate of rise of short circuit currents is inherently limited by transformer windings in the power stage. b) Failure of a main thyristor does not result in the destruction of any other components. c) The system can operate over a wide range of passive and regenerative load power factors. d) The main thyristors are soft commutated and thus do not suffer the derating associated with hard commutation. e) The main thyristors are not derated by commutation current pulses or voltage overshoots. The operation of this system is described and equivalent circuits for the various operating modes of a commutation cycle are analyzed. A design procedure is presented whereby commutation components can be selected."

"A transmission electron microscope study of precipitation in an MnS-AlN-inhibited 3% silicon steel is described. The effects of various hot rolled band heat treatments are related to precipitate morphologies developed by subsequent cold rolling and recrystallization in a decarburizing anneal. The hot rolled band heat treatments consisted of solutioning at 1120°C, air cooling to selected temperatures and quenching. Quenching at temperatures higher than about 650°C resulted in a uniformly distributed fine structure (approx. 100Å) imaged by strain contrast and believed to be vacancy discs stabilized by carbon diffusion. The vacancy discs did not occur in hot rolled bands quenched from temperatures below 650°C. Cold rolled and recrystallized structures derived from high quench temperatures contained clusters of very fine precipitate particles. The clusters consisted mostly of spheroidal MnS particles with some angular AlN particles. The tendency for particle clustering decreased with decreasing quench temperature, and non-uniform coarsening of the MnS particles occurred both within clusters and from cluster to cluster. Quenching from 540°C and below resulted in essentially random particle distribution and in the more frequent occurrence of angular AlN particles. The absence of particle clusters in cold rolled and recrystallized structures corresponded approximately with the disappearance of vacancy discs as quench temperature was decreased in the original heat treatments."
"The observation of the domain pattern of 3% grain-oriented silicon-iron (transformer steel) by the Kerr magneto-optic effect has enabled a greater understanding of the basic magnetization processes of this material to be obtained. In this review paper, an attempt is made to describe recent progress in this field of study. The principal commercial criterion of transformer steel is the power loss and therefore many attempts have been made to correlate the domain observations with measured loss. The increased knowledge of the shape of the loss per cycle against frequency characteristic has shown that the anomalous loss is responsible for approximately 50% of the total loss. Experimental results are described which attribute the anomalous loss to many causes such as the occurrence of domain walls, domain wall angles and configuration, variation of wall spacing with lamination thickness, non-uniform and non-repetitive wall motion (pinning), grain size effects, lack of flux penetration (wall bowing) and domain nucleation. In addition, experimental domain observations are described which explain the optimum thickness of transformer steel for minimum loss and the variation of power loss with applied stress."
"The effect of N2in the anneal atmosphere on the texture and the associated magnetic properties of Al bearing 3% Si-Fe was investigated. Cold rolled/decarburized samples were annealed in either 100% H2or a mixture of 25% N2-75% H2. Orientations of grains were determined using selected area electron channeling. Misoriented (i.e., not"
"One of the techniques for producing highly textured 3% SiFe involves the use of AlN precipitates for the stabilization of primary grains during the process of secondary recrystallization; however, the presence of S (presumably as MnS) was also found necessary. Because of the chemical similarity between S and Se, an investigation was made to determine if Se could be used in addition to or as a substitute for S. A number of laboratory melts were made containing various amounts of S and Se, and these heats were processed to yield oriented steels with\\mu10 > 1900. The following polynomial equation was used to approximate the true relationships of the studied variables on the response variable (magnetic permeability) :\\mu_{10} = A_{0} + \\Sigma_{i}a_{i}X_{i} + \\Sigma_{j}a_{j}X_{j}^{2} + \\Sigma_{k}a_{k}X_{i}X_{j} + aX_{i}X_{j}X_{k} + \\varepsilonwhere the Xi, etc., are the alloying variables that are considered important in the secondary recrystallization process, e.g., S, Se and Mn, and\\varepsilonis an error term. This relationship defines a response surface of permeability as a function of alloying additions. Constant permeability contours are used to show that Se may be considered a good replacement for S, but only if very little S is present, suggesting a deleterious interaction between Mn, S, and Se. Precipitates of Mn (S, Se) were found in the primary recrystallized matrix."
"The analysis of Barkhausen noise amplitude distributions is applied to the study of strain dependence of the magnetization process between 0 and 16 % strain in commercial grain oriented and isotropic Fe- 3.5 % Si sheet. The Barkhausen noise is excited at 4 Hz magnetizing frequency and analysed in the range 300 to 15,000 Hz. The measurements indicate a strong interaction between average noise amplitude and elastic strain, depending on the direction of the magnetizing field. In the plastic region the analysis is carried out with and without simultaneously applied elastic tension. In this case the average noise amplitude appears to follow sensitively the changes in dislocation structure starting from single dislocations to different dislocation arrangements, as shown by detailed transmission electron microscope study. The effects are interpreted in terms of the magnetoelastic interaction between domain wall movements and dislocation stress fields. As a result a rather simple nondestructive means for inspecting the microstructural inhomogeneities in transformer iron is suggested."
"The basic properties of flat sheet and flat ladder levitation systems are compared and contrasted based on the assumption that identical quantities of material are used in their construction. It is shown that although ladder systems can produce slightly better lift-to-drag ratios, the overall performance of sheets is better, particularly where lateral destabilization must be minimized."
"Potential applications for superconducting magnets have received substantial attention since the early 1960's when the modern era of high field superconducting materials began. A major survey of current and near-term applications world wide was published in 1974 and updated for the U.S. in 1976 . The total US expenditures in FY75 were approximately$30 \\times 10^{6}distributed in all applied areas of superconductivity. A number of authors have examined specific areas of superconducting magnet applications, and we note a few of the most recent: High Energy Physics, Fusion, MHD, Magnetically Leviated Vehicles, Magnetic Separation, Energy Storage, Pulsed Energy Delivery, Electron Microscopes, and Medical Applications. A summary application paper by Powell gives an excellent overview of large scale applications and a summary paper by Kolm concentrates on many of the less well known industrial applications. There surely are many other applications overlooked by these brief references, and many more, as yet, unformulated. The number of superconducting magnets applied in and out of the Laboratory will grow dramatically over the next decade. The big money areas will be high-energy physics ring magnets, followed by CTR experimental coils, with MHD magnets a probable third in magnitude. No other single magnet application is likely to become a big money operation, but collectively they will be very significant. Magnetic levitation research will continue overseas, but is unlikely to be adopted for transit use in the next decade. Magnetic energy storage research will expand, but the scale necessary for economic adoption will preclude its near-term application. Magnetic separation will spread to areas like fuel desulferization, waste water treatment, ore benefication, and blood processing, but the areas where superconducting magnets are economically justifiable will likely remain small. In the search for large market applications, we should not overlook the uniqueness superconductivity offers to the solution of difficult, individualized, science and engineering problems. Perhaps that will always be its forte, and only when viewed collectively can the true impace on the future be assessed."
 "There are more than five types of the magnetically levitated tracked vehicles, on which research and development efforts are being made. All of them provide contactless support and guidance to vehicles, and may be able to eliminate technical problems of the conventional railways, which are supported and guided by wheels on rails. Most popular ones among the proposed types are the electrodynamic levitation, which makes use of repulsive force of superconductive electromagnets, and the electromagnetic levitation, which makes use of attracting force of normal-conductive electromagnets. One of the problems of EDL is the stability problem. EDL is a system, which has very small damping and is liable to oscillation. Although test runs have been made on two EDL system of appreciable sizes, it is still premature to make a definite conclusion on the dynamic stability problem. One of the problems of EML is the small gap length between magnets on vehicle and rails on ground. Probability of contact at the small gap will limit the highest speed limit available. A large number of test runs have been made on EML test vehicles of appreciable sizes in various countries. The probability of contact can be determined by analyses based on the power spectral density of the rail roughness. EML has much test data and analytical data, which might predict a bright prospect on its applications in speed range much higher than conventional railways. Present status of R. & D. of magnetic levitation technology in Japan will be explained."
"Diffusion couples formed in the range600 - 800\\degC, between cobalt-copper alloys (0-25 at. % Cu) and Sm(Co,Cu)3containing the same amount of copper, have shown that copper progressively depresses the eutectoid transformation of SmCo5down to 600° C at 21 at. % copper. The data indicate the transformation temperature of SmCo5itself to be about 805° C. Subsidiary couples formed between cobalt-samarium (up to SmCo5) and copper-samarium alloys (up to SmCu6), taken with the above, show the SmCo5and SmCu5phases to be mutually soluble above the eutectoid transformation temperature. In addition, it is found that cobalt and Sm(Co,Cu)5come into direct equilibrium over a wide range of copper contents (10-70 at. %). The Sm2Co17phase field is consequently of very limited extent and can contain up to a maximum of 4 at. % copper at the solid solution limit at 800° C."
 "The oxidation cf pyrite has been so far studied by standard methods such as TGA and DTA, whereas we have used a new magnetokinetic approach for studying such oxidation processes. The kinetics are followed using a vibrating sample magnetometer as a probe to quantify the magnetic parameters of the intermediate and final reaction products, as a continuous function of time at specific temperatures, and as a function of their particle size and superparamagnetic properties. The technological relevance of our work stems partly from the possible magnetic separation of pyrite from coal after its oxidation (or reduction) to ferri- and antiferromagnetic compounds. The results of such magnetokinetic studies are presented and capabilities of the magnetokinetic technique are exemplified in terms of unique results, which elude standard TGA and DTA techniques."
"A single-wire theory of an axially ordered filter has been developed and its consequencies discussed. A typical example of the design of ordered filters has been investigated and attention given to filter elements capable of holding magnetic fibres in a desired position in space."
"Photographs are presented of the buildup process in single wire HGMS. Three configurations were studied, including the case most commonly presented in the literature. The shape of the buildup was compared with theoretical predictions where available. The results show that some of the theoretical predictions are adequate; but others are not."
 "Eddy current density for a thin cylinder of finite length is calculated for the case of a driving field of ramp time dependence and dipole spatial dependence, the dipole being at the center of the cylinder. The calculations are made by using a perturbation expansion of the eddy current integral equations with a polynomial approximation to the time factor of the driving term. The steady state solution, presented as an arrow plot, shows the effects of edge charges forcing currents to remain within the conductor. The transient solutions show that the entire geometrical pattern of the steady state eddy currents is approached uniformly in the typical exponential manner of diffusion equations. Typical transient curves are given. All calculations are in normalized coordinates to allow maximum flexibility in applications."
"The initial permeability μithe loss factor\\tan\\delta, and the inverse quality factor\\tan\\delta/\\mu_{i}of Fe5Co70Si15B10ribbons 35μm, 30μm, 25μm and 21μm in thickness were measured with a Maxwell Bridge from room temperature to 140°C in the high-frequency region from 3kHz to 500kHz. The initial permeability of the ribbon 21μm in thickness was about 10,600 at 3kHz and 4300 at 500kHz. The residual loss coefficient C1and the hysteresis loss coefficient h1were extremely low, about8\\times10^{-3}and 60(cm/A), respectively. In the high-frequency region, the eddy current loss term increases with the square of the thickness of the ribbons and plays the most important part of all the magnetic losses."
"A new metallic glass, (METGLAS®alloy) Co74Fe6B20, has been identified which exhibits ∼ zero magnetostriction (|\\lambda_{s}|<0.4\\times10^{-6}). The saturation induction of this new alloy, 11.8 kG, is approximately twice that reported for other non-magnetostrictive glasses with similar transition-metal (TM) content but including the metalloids P and Al or Si in addition to B. This larger magnetization results from the weaker hybridization of the TM d-bands with the valence bands of boron than with those of other metalloids. Due to the absence of magnetostriction, no coupling between winding stresses and magnetic properties exists. Hence, as-quenched/as-wound toroids of Co74Fe6B20glass exhibit exceptional low-field magnetic properties:H_{c} = 0.035Oe,B_{r} = 9800gauss and\\mu_{max} = 280,000."
"The concentration dependence of the magnetic properties of amorphous Fe-P-B alloys obtained by splat-cooling is discussed. For a given Fe concentration, the magnetic moment\\bar{\\mu}averaged over all atoms of material and the Curie temperature Tcboth increase with the substitution of B for P. We observed for the variation of\\bar{\\mu}and Tcas a function of the B content the same discontinuity as that occurring between the two phases\\varepsilonand\\varepsilon_{1}of the crystalline Fe3P1-xBxcompounds. We studied also the variation of\\bar{\\mu}and Tcwhen one metalloid (P or B) substitutes for Fe, the other metalloid remaining constant.\\bar{\\mu}was found to decrease when the P (or B) content is increased, as expected from a rigid band model. For the same concentrations, Tcincreases. The different behaviours of\\bar{\\mu}and Tcare tentatively explained by assuming that the amorphous Fe has two magnetic states (ferro and antiferromagnetic) as already suggested for crystalline Fe in a fcc environment."
"The magnetic properties of amorphous alloys (Ni1-cCoc)0.78P0.14B0.08have been investigated. The samples were prepared by the splat-cooling method. The Curie temperatures have been determined and the magnetization measurements performed for 1.7°K\\leq T \\leq 270\\degK and fields up to 70 kOe. Ni0.78P0.14B0.08is paramagnetic, whereas Co0.78P0.14B0.08is ferromagnetic until the crystallization temperature (678°K). The average moment per cobalt atom is1.15 \\mu_{B}. In (Ni1-cCoc)0.78P0.14B0.08the critical concentration for the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition isc \\simeq 0.15, this transition occurs in an inhomogeneous way. The saturation magnetization in the whole concentration range can be interpreted (as for some crystallized alloys and compounds) by a local environment model, when a reasonable short range order is assumed. In such a model the magnetic moment per cobalt atom is related merely to the number of its Co first neighbors nCo. For nCo=0 and 1 the cobalt atom is not magnetic, for nCo= 2 and 3 it carries a small moment\\mu_{1} = 0.50 \\mu_{B}and for nCo> 3 it is magnetic with\\mu_{2} = 1.15 \\mu_{B}as in Co0.78P0.14B0.08; the nickel atoms do not carry a substantial moment in the entire concentration range. These features are comparable to those obtained in some crystalline alloys."
"A ferromagnetic metallic glass Fe80P16B1C3(METGLAS®2615) has been studied from 4.2 K to 1100 K by57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the glassy state, the magnetization axis stays in the ribbon plane atT \\gsim 420K. Below 420 K, the axis on the average is at an angle to the ribbon plane. Since the magnetic ordering temperature Tcis close to the lowest crystallization temperature, Tccan only be estimated. There are two distinct crystallization temperatures. AtT_{cr1} = 568K, the glassy sample transforms slowly but exclusively to α-Fe. AtT_{cr2} = 640K, the remainder of the glassy sample transforms rapidly to α-Fe (T_{c} = 1040K) and Fe3P (T_{c} = 715K). These results are discussed in comparison with the thermomagnetization and x-ray data obtained previously."
"The development of permanent magnets based on the rare earth-cobalt 2-17 phases is reviewed. Powdered as well as sintered alloys of Sm2(Co, Fe)17have not shown very good permanent magnet properties. But modifications of these 2-17 phases with other, additional transition metals often exhibit more useful magnetic properties, particularly in sintered form. Detailed studies on one series of such alloys, Cu and Fe-modified nonstoichiometric 2-17 phases, are presented. A grain size of about5-10 \\mum was required to obtain an intrinsic coercive force on the order of 10 kOe, or 10% of the anisotropy field, in sintered samples of these \"1-8 alloys\"."
"Co-Gd-Sm alloys were made by calcium co-reduction of mixtures of Gd2O3and Sm2O3in the presence of cobalt powder. Both the base alloy (Co5Gd0.4Sm0.6) and the sintering additive (Co7Gd0.8Sm1.2) were made by this lower cost R/D process. Die-pressed magnets with a reversible temperature coefficient of magnetization of -0.004 %/°C and an energy product of 9.9 MGOe were made. These magnets performed well in a TWT stack. Co-Ho and Co-Er alloys were also made by the calcium reduction of their oxides. And, one Co-Ho-Sm magnet made from ingot material had a(BH)_{\\max}= 12.4MGOe and a reversible coefficient equal to zero near room temperature."
"Sm(Co0.08Cu0.13)zalloys were prepared with7.2 \\leq z < 8. Homogenization heat-treatment yielded single phase 2-17 material forz > 7.2. Forz = 7.8some of the Co was substituted by Fe. The alloys remained single phase for up to 15 % Co substituted. With further increasing Fe content a Co-Fe phase appears accompanied by a strong decrease of the hard magnetic properties. The compounds were hard magnetic in bulk form with ideal rectangular hysteresis loops. The coercivity could be increased by a factor > 2 with a low temperature heat-treatment. BRvalues > 11 kG together withIHcvalues of about 4 kOe were achieved on single crystal samples. The coercivity mechanism in these materials is pinning of Bloch walls."
"Micropowders of strontium ferrite were obtained by extended wet milling (over 1500 h) of an ordinary SrFe12O19powder prepared by a chemical process from oxalates. The room temperature intrinsic coercive force of the micropowder drastically increased from about 300 Oe (as milled samples) to 6000 - 6500 Oe after removing the stresses and the defects, introduced by milling, by a suitable annealing at900 - 1000\\degC. This is one of the highest coercive force reported up to the present for isotropic strontium ferrite powder and it nearly approaches the theoretical value for this material. The magnetic behaviour of these powders is well described by the coherent rotation model of Stoner and Wohlfarth for an assembly of single domain particles oriented at random.Isotropic magnet samples were sintered from these micro-powders at 1150°C. The main magnetic properties of the sintered body were:H_{ci}= 4100Oe andB_{r} = 2000G. The energy product maximum was estimated at approximately 0.85 MGO."
"In magnetic bubble memory packages having a bias field HBsupplied by a Ba-ferrite permanent magnet structure, the magnitude of HBmay be appreciably altered after setting by transient exposure to externally applied magnetic fields Hextas much as 10 times smaller than the field used in setting HB. We examine this effect for a particular magnet design having a permalloy yoke, a gap of 0.270 inches, and a saturation fieldH_{sat} \\simeq 240Oe. We find that the magnitude of the effect depends upon the ratioH_{B}/H_{sat}and upon the procedure used in setting HB. After setting toH_{B} = 200Oe from saturation with a demagnetizing fieldH_{ext} = -1400Oe, a remagnetizing fieldH_{ext} \\simeq 1800Oe is required to increase HBby 1%. On the other hand, after setting toH_{B} = 100Oe withH_{ext} = -2300Oe, a remagnetizing fieldH_{ext} \\simeq 400Oe is sufficient to increase HBby 1%. Setting by demagnetizing from saturation yields superior stability to setting by magnetizing from the demagnetized state, and stability of the set magnet may be further improved by demagnetizing with a ringing (alternating) field. This behavior is explained with a simple model and its importance for magnet design is discussed."
"Long-term testing of the data reliability has been done on 68 kbit bubble device chips of a serial shift register design. The chips were fabricated using LPE garnet of the YSmLuGeCa composition with 3 micron strip-width. The bubble propagation structure contained a single permalloy element per 16 micron period. Testing was done at 50 kHz and 40 Oe rotating field over a chip temperature range from 30°C to 100°C. The data show that such chips have at least 15 Oe of bias field margin with an error probability of less than3 \\times 10^{-14}per bubble per cycle of rotating field, although this margin can be reduced by chip defects. Preliminary results indicate that the operating parameters of the chip have a significant impact on the error rate. An investigation of bubble propagation, separated out from the other bubble functions, shows that the propagation error rate near the high bias field limit decreases more rapidly than exponentially with decreasing bias field."
"The coefficient of the linear variation of field strength with temperature in Ba-ferrite is shown to have a simple functional dependence upon the permeance coefficient (B/H ratio) of the magnet structure. Using cylindrical magnets with aspect ratios of 0.030 to 4.00 and measuring the field strength from -35 °C to +65 °C, we observe temperature coefficients varying by about 40% from -0.150%/°C to -0.207%/°C These values have a simple relationship to calculated magnet permeance coefficients. An analog circuit approach is presented for calculating the permeance coefficients of complex bias magnet systems. The temperature coefficients predicted from the calculated permeance coefficients and the measured bias field temperature dependences are in good agreement."
 "Two magnetic detectors spaced one-half data cell apart and coupled with the appropriate simple decode electronics can be employed as a read system for Aiken-encoded magnetic tape. The resultant read system will provide output data which are independent of the speed of the magnetic tape relative to the read head (scan speed). If, in addition, the magnetic detectors respond to the magnetic flux from the magnetic tape rather than to changes in the magnetic flux, the read head output becomes totally independent of the scan speed. Such a system is especially useful for applications which require scan speed-independent reading of low density information, as, for instance, with hand-driven, magnetically encoded credit cards."
 "Koch has criticized the common assumption that the force exerted by a permanent magnet on a keeper can be calculated from the increase of the internal or external energy of the magnet, since both these quantities pass through a maximum as the keeper is removed. He introduces a new term the \"Demagnetizing energy\". The present paper shows that this term is equal to the total field energy inside and outside the magnet, the former being equal to the energy of the self-demagnetizing field with the magnet treated as free space. The energy transitions in a permanent magnet are more easily understood, if it is recognized that the energy at the remanence point on closed circuit is not zero. This energy appears to be used in D.C. pulse transformers and ferrite memory cores."
"To help elucidate some of the properties associated with the permanent magnetism of Sm1Co5, an experimental investigatlon was made of the magnetic and crystallographic characteristics of the tertiary alloys Sm.9z.1Co5where Z represents various selected elements other than rare earths or magnetic transition elements, that partially replace Sm in Sm1Co5. The selected elements were Hf, Zr, Mg, Sb, Sn, Pb, Ca, Bi, Se, and Te. The Hf substituted alloy had the hexagonal Ca1Cu5structure. All the remaining alloys were found to be two phase materials involving the 1-5 hexagonal and 2-17 rhombohedral structures. Magnetic measurements on these alloys in the form of loosely packed, free-to-orient 38μm powder showed that the coercive forces and remanent magnetization of each ternary alloy powder, with the exception of Sm.9Hf.1Co5and Sm.9Hf.1Co5, were considerably less than that of Sm1Co5powder. Based upon these results, the structural and magnetic properties of a series of Sm1-xHfxCo5, Sm1-xMgxCo5, Sm.9Hf.1Co5-xFex, Sm2(1-x)Hf2xCo17and Sm2(1-x)Mg2xCo17alloys were also investigated."
 "The magnetomechanical coupling factor k, the Young's modulusEand the\\DeltaEeffect as a function of bias field were measured by a mechanical resonance method of amorphous Fe80P13C7ribbons which were annealed at different temperatures in a magnetic field. In the ribbon which was annealed at 350°C for 20 minutes, a remarkably large coupling factor k was found in the bias field 5 Oe to be 0.53, which was almost the same as the value of the high magnetostrictive rare earth-Fe2. The\\DeltaEeffect increased with the increase of the bias field, took a gigantic value 0.8 at about 5 Oe and then decreased monotonically with the increase of the bias field. The\\DeltaEeffect is known to correspond to a change in sound velocity, so that the change of the sound velocity was also observed as a function of the frequency from 100kHz to 1MHz in a delay line using the ribbons."
"When rare earth (R) cobalt alloys such as SmCo5and MMCo5were mechanically polished for microscopic examination, it was noted that grooves are formed at the domain walls present in the material. \"Grooving\" was also found at the domain walls when RCo5alloy specimens were electropolished. Light microscope and scanning electron microscope were used to observe the grooves. The grooves are interpreted as resulting from accelerated material removal at the domain walls compared to the material removal in the rest of the specimen during the polishing (mechanical, chemical, or electrochemical) operation. Domain wall energies in RCo5compounds are in the range of 50 to 100 erg/cm2compared to about 0.5 to 1 kerg/cm2for the surface energy of the alloys. The grooving of the domain walls is discussed in light of those relative energy differences."
"The magnetization reversal in copper-containing cobalt-rare-earth permanent magnet materials can be completely dominated by pure bulk wall-pinning. This is shown by the form of hysteresis loops in varying magnetizing fields, whose appearance is in extreme contrast to those of unmodified cobalt-rare earths, in which nucleation is the dominant factor in magnetization reversal. In some copper-modified materials it is possible to show both kinds of behavior in the same sample, with a sudden transition at a particular value of magnetizing field."
"Metallic glass ribbon of the composition Fe40Ni40P14B6, METGLAS® alloy 2826, has been produced in kilogram quantities with controlled magnetic properties. Cylindrical shields have been made by interlacing such ribbons using three different methods. Shielding ratios have been measured at 60 Hz for the cylindrical shields and compared with an equal weight shield wrapped from polycrystalline 80/20 NiFe foil. Shielding ratios of woven metallic glass compare favorably with equal weight polycrystalline foil shields. The woven metallic glass shield also has the important advantage of being flexible and less sensitive to mechanical strain."
"Cold-rolling of Fe40Ni40P14B6amorphous alloy ribbon results in a large increase in coercive force and a large decrease in magnetization in low fields. It is suggested that these changes are the result of both the sliplike structures developed by the rolling and the strain-magnetostriction induced anisotropy. On annealing the rolled ribbon to temperatures below the crystallization temperature, the magnetic properties recover to the values obtained on annealing as-cast ribbon, but higher temperatures are required. The rolled ribbon showed no evidence for structural changes in high resolution electron micrographs; x-ray and electron diffraction patterns showed no change in the width or position of the diffuse rings; and the glass and crystallization temperatures remained unchanged. However, small angle x-ray scattering showed a decrease in intensity at small angles, and stress relief measurements showed a small increase in the stress-relief rate. Both as-cast and rolled ribbons when annealed even to within a few degrees of the start of crystallization showed no change in the width or position of the diffraction peaks, and no change in the heat of crystallization, glass transition, or crystallization temperature. However, on annealing, the small angle x-ray scattering increased, and stress-relief rate decreased. The change in small angle scattering is qualitatively interpreted as being due to the removal of scattering nuclei on rolling and their development during annealing. The stress relief results are discussed in terms of changes in short-range atomic order."
"Expected requirements for high-capacity, modest-cost underground transmission of energy have motivated intense development of superconducting power transmission lines. Recent studies and laboratory developments have generated much reason for optimism. The U.S. now has three ongoing projects to develop superconducting cables - a rigid ac system design employing Nb conductors, a flexible ac system employing Nb3Sn tapes, and a flexible dc cable system design employing Nb3Sn tape or multifilamentary conductors. In addition there are a number of supporting research projects in the fields of cryogenic dielectrics, helium fluid flow and heat transfer, cryogenic refrigeration, and superconducting materials. This review paper presents an overview of these ongoing activities."
"A hybrid bubble organization is proposed which combines the advantages of both major-minor loop and decoder organizations while eliminating some of the complexity of the decoder organization. The organization consists of multiplexed decoder sections in which the selection of different blocks is performed in part by decoding and in part by a major-minor type time domain selection. The number of decoder steps can be reduced at the expense of a modest increase in access time. This organization allows the use of a low current retarding type decoder element, thus reducing the on-chip power consumption. Also, a number of decoder conductors can share the same driver, reducing the number of external chip connections."
"An exact analysis of the induced electromagnetic fields and eddy current losses in a long nonmagnetic conducting cylinder of rectangular cross-section placed in the field of a coaxial finite length circular coil is presented for the first time. A new formulation of the field problem in terms of two one-dimensional Fredholm integral equations of the second kind is used to compute the surface fields and losses in the cylinder due to an infinitely long coil with travelling wave excitation. Fourier integral representation is used to replace the finite length coil by travelling wave ones with a continuous spectrum of wavenumbers. A new efficient method for the direct calculation of the power loss in the wavenumber domain is presented. Numerical results for different cylinder and coil dimensions and different frequencies are given."
"This paper considers the problem of estimating the core losses in a thin magnetic steel lamination when the driving flux contains not only the fundamental, but also odd harmonic components. Two numerical methods of predicting the eddy current losses due to an arbitrary flux waveform are briefly described. The important case of 3rd harmonic distortion is specifically considered. The digital simulations are used to develop a very simple model that describes the eddy current and hysteresis losses under the assumed distortion conditions with good accuracy."
"This paper is a brief description of the operating principle and the circuit configuration of a new frequency multiplier. This device uses a magnetic core of unusual shape having multiple holes. An AC voltage of a frequencyfHz can easily be converted to a sine wave voltage at an optional multiplied frequency. In addition, this device has a number of excellent operating characteristics."
"A new bubble propagation pattern for field access devices has been developed which has a period to gap ratio of 8:1. In this pattern of semicircular elements (half-disk) the gaps are situated between essentially parallel poles in contrast to the TI pattern where gaps are located between orthogonal poles. The bubble, therefore, comes under the influence of two strong parallel poles causing it to stretch across the gap. The energy barrier that would normally be encountered thus virtually disppears. Devices of 32, 18, and 10 μm periods have been designed and fabricated. The results show a typical margin of at least 20% of the bias field under normal operating conditions. The operating drive field is relatively low for small bubbles. The minimum drive field for a 10 μm period pattern is only 13 Oe."
"Recent years have witnessed considerable research activity in the application of digital-computer methods for the determination of the electro-magnetic fields in electrical machinery through the solution of Maxwell's equations, while taking full account of the magnetic saturation. Two distinct numerical approaches are evident in the literature: Finite-Difference Method and Finite-Element Method. The author has presented in the recent years a finite difference formulation for 3-dimensional numerical solutions of the nonlinear electromagnetic field problems in terms of potential functions, and has applied for the analysis of the end-zone fields of aerospace homopolar alternators and solid-rotor induction motors. The present work is directed towards the finite-element formulation for the numerical solution of three-dimensional nonlinear magnetostatic field problems. A variational principle is developed here utilizing the vector potential concept. The approach is based on variational methods in which a corresponding energy functional for the nonlinear case is minimized over the entire region. The minimization is performed by means of the finite-element method and the resultant set of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved through iterative schemes."
"The method of scalar magnetic potential using imaginary magnetic charges is employed effectively for the calculation of the electromagnetic fields in superconducting electric machines. The computing model consists of several single layers of magnetic charges. Finite-difference numerical techniques are utilized for the computation. The cylindrical coordinate system has been used for the calculation of the electromagnetic losses inside the electromagnetic shield of the rotor windings. The tangential and axial components of eddy currents have been taken into account. Linear magnetic charges replace rotor and stator currents; and surface magnetic charges replace the eddy currents inside the electromagnetic shield of the rotor windings. Various systems of partial differential equations have been formulated for the computer-aided analysis of this problem."
"The concept of scalar potential has been used for magnetic field calculation in the USSR during the last decade. It is based on treating the eddy component of the magnetic field separately and calculating the potential field with the help of the scalar potential, by introducing imaginary magnetic charges. This method has been developed for digital calcula - tions of magnetic fields in various electromagnetic devices, by solving linear and nonlinear partial-differential equations through mathematical simulation. This paper presents the mathematical formulation of the method. It is advantageous to use the scalar potential method for two-dimensional eddy-current calculations because of the possibility to solve the equations just over the conductor surfaces. The general three-dimensional problem can be formulated in different ways. The scalar potential method is also used for the computer-aided analysis of eddy-current problems of conventional and superconducting electric machines."
"Recent years have witnessed considerable research activity in the application of digital-computer methods for the determination of the electromagnetic fields in electrical devices through the solution of Maxwell's equations, while taking full account of the magnetic saturation. Slow rate of convergence towards a meaningful solution and consequent demand for prohibitively large computer time are some of the chief drawbacks of the numerical iterative procedures. Many efforts have been made to find satisfactory methods of accelerating the convergence and thereby minimize the computer time needed for the solution. Various methods such as application of relaxation factors, block-relaxation procedures, and alternating-direction iterative techniques have been developed. It is the purpose of this paper to present a new method of computing an appropriate optimum relaxation factor for the reluctivity at each grid point (in 2- dimensions) or lattice point (in 3-dimensions) depending on the value of the local flux density and its location on the magnetization characteristic."
"The saturation of a magnetic recording head has been studied by numerically solving for the scalar magnetic potential in a region which includes the pole tip corners. The method follows Monson in which the bulk saturation behavior provides the boundary conditions. It is shown that saturation of the pole corner primarily affects the recording field gradients and does so appreciably only when the deep-gap field exceeds one half the material saturation magnetization. The field magnitudes are only slightly affected and remain dominated by the bulk saturation. It is argued that reductions in short-wavelength recorded signal should occur when the recording medium coercivity exceeds approximately one-quarter the saturation magnetization of the head material. This condition is almost reached by the utilization of ferrite record heads (M_{s} \\cong 4-5kG) to record on high coercivity media (H_{c} \\cong 1000Oe). The computation is restricted to two dimensions and the effects of losses, such as eddy currents, have not been included."
  "Using photolithographic and thin-film deposition techniques various types of single- and multi-turn inductive heads have been fabricated, with or without a magnetoresistive (MR) element in the gap. The MR element has a Barberpole configuration, which makes biasing by an external field superfluous. Reading has also been done inductively. Read and write experiments have been performed on tape and disc."
"This paper describes the temperature dependence of magnetization, the anisotropy constant K1and the magnetostriction constant λgammaof single crystals of Tb2Co17, Ho2Co17and Er2Co17over the temperature range 77.4°K to 400°K. Tb2Co17and Ho2Co17have a uniformly easy magnetization in the basal plane while Er2Co17maintains an easy C axis over the entire temperature range. The anisotropy constant K1was determined by a least square fit of the theoretical equation of magnetization to the measured magnetization curve along the hard axis. The anisotropy constant K1at 297°K for Tb2Co17, Ho2Co17and Er2Co17is,-3.2\\times10^{7},-0.9\\times10^{7}and0.41\\times10^{7}ergs/cm3, respectively. The magnetostriction coefficient λγwas determined by the strain gage technique. The contribution of the Tb ion to the magnetostriction constant λγof the R2Co17compound is positive whereas the contribution of the Ho ion is negative. The magnetostrictive behavior of the Tb ion is single ion in nature."
"Some magnetic frequency triplers using the saturation characteristics of an iron core have been reported. In this paper a new frequency tripler which is based on the bridge-connected reactor circuit is proposed. The features of this tripler are that an applied source is single phase and ferro-resonance circuits are formed in both the output and input side. Consequently, the circuit becomes very simple, the power factor is greatly improved and the triple frequency output voltage holds constant. This paper presents some experiments and considerations on a new tripler. Moreover, various circuits which have equivalent operating characteristics are proposed."
"Ferromagnetic fluids have been prepared by the electrodeposition of iron on to an agitated mercury cathode. The mercury contained additives such as tin and sodium, the presence of which, has been shown to enhance particle stability. The particle sizes are approximately 45Å in diameter and fluids stable over many months have now been prepared. Magnetisation measurements have been made at 77K and 293K and the ageing effects of heating the fluids to 420K have been studied over the short and long term. The saturation magnetisation of these samples studied is typically 65 gauss and the fluids are visibly ferromagnetic. Magnetic measurements indicate that all fluids prepared are superparamagnetic at room temperature but possess properties of hysteresis in the solid state at 77K. The coercive force at 77K for those fluids with additives increased less rapidly on ageing than for fluids without additives. For those fluids containing tin and sodium, the coercive force becomes constant within 24 hours at an ageing temperature of 420K. The change in coercive force during ageing is considered to arise from an increase in particle size and the constant value obtained in the fluid containing tin and sodium is interpreted as an indication that particle growth has been inhibited. The magnetic properties are dependent upon the particle size distributions and good agreement is obtained between the experimental observations and the theoretical form of the coercive force against particle size curve obtained from a log normal distribution. Measurements of the coercive force and remanence not only allows the stability of the ferromagnetic fluid to be monitored but also enable predictions to be made concerning the particle size distribution. The results of such measurements on iron particles in mercury with tin and sodium as additives are presented in this paper."
"An analysis has been made of the utilization of 65,536 bit bubble memory chips in small memory hierarchies for microcomputers and minicomputers. Two basic chip organizations were considered. One chip organization was assumed to be equivalent to that of Ypma, Gergis, and Archer with a conventional major minor loop configuration. The other organization considered employed a major-minor loop configuration in which the minor loops were broken into two segments to facilitate stacking and implementation of multilevel hierarchies as suggested by Tung, Chen, and Chang. The analysis shows that a near optimum organization for 65,536-bit chips with segmented minor loops consists of 64 minor loops of 1024 bits with each minor loop broken into a 64-bit segment and a 960-bit segment."
"Ferrite thin films with superior mechanical and magnetic properties for a magnetic disk medium have been obtained using reactive sputtering. Recording characteristics of these films considerably exceed those of a conventional γ-Fe2O3coating medium. Hematite thin films were produced on an aluminium alloy substrate by sputtering Fe-Al-Co alloy target in an atmosphere of mixed argon and oxygen. Hematite films were transformed to ferrite films by reduction in hydrogen atmosphere for 2-4 hours at 300°C. The substrate used was covered with a thin alumite layer formed by anodic oxidation to improve surface hardness."
"Reliable performance in today's high areal density digital magnetic recording disk systems requires the optimization of all magnetic and system parameters. The remanent magnetization of the storage surface is one of those important parameters. Major performance limitations are imposed by the writing-demagnetization, and interaction-demagnetization. Minimization of these adverse effects requires a reduction in the thickness of the coating and/or in its remanent magnetization, and a magnetic orientation of the acicular magnetic particles along the circumferential direction of the disk. However, for very high density disk systems such as the IBM 3350 (about 2400 bits/cm and 240 tracks/cm), the reduction in the coating thickness of the disk (down to 0.75-1.0μm) must be compensated by a judicious adjustment of its remanence to ensure adequate output signal. In this study we used the Dynamic Iterative Model to simulate the single pulse, two-pulse, and multiple transition response of an IBM 3350-like channel, and examined the effect of remanence (in the range of 300-1050 Gauss) on resolution, peak shift, and signal output for two values of coating thickness (0.76μm and 1 μm). We conclude that a large remanence is desirable in that it provides a much larger signal while the adverse effect on resolution and peak shift is very small."
"The saturation magnetostriction constant (λs) determines the remanence loss of a recording tape when an impact is applied normal to the plane of the tape. The addition of Co to iron oxide particles alters λsand increases the coercive force. As Co is added to γ-Fe2O3, λsbecomes more negative and the stress demagnetization is greater; when Co is added to Fe3O4, λsis less positive and the stress demagnetization becomes smaller. Impact-induced losses of up to 30% of the remanence are measured on Co doped γ-Fe2O3tapes with\\lambda_{s} = -15 \\times 10^{-6}; this compares with a 1% loss in CrO2tapes where\\lambda_{s} \\sim 1 \\times 10^{-6} . \\lambda_{s}is measured on particle compacts using a strain gage; its value can also be estimated from the coercive force change produced when applying uniaxial tension to a tape."
"D.C. electromagnets are generally used in electric devices such as an electromagnetic switch, an electro-magnetic relay, an electromagnetic value, etc.. The transient magnetization affects the determination of the electromagnetic force and the performance characteristic. However, there are few reports on the details of the transient phenomena in an electromagnet. The purpose of this paper is to describe two phenomena which are obtained from the numerical analyses and some experiments. One is the time lag of magnetic flux due to the skin effect. The other is the transient magnetization process near the gap in the plunger type electromagnet made of solid core."
"The peculiarities of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the rare earth intermetallics are discussed briefly. Only the part of the magnetic anisotropy energy related to the rare earth ion system is analyzed. This anisotropy in most cases can be satisfactorily described in terms of a single-ion model. Theory and experiment relating to magnetocrystalline anisotropy of RCo5compounds are reviewed as an example (R is one of the rare earths or yttrium)."
"This paper presents a comparison between the finite element and difference methods applied to two dimensional nonlinear magnetic field problems. The comparison is based on the determination of the magnetic field distribution in a shell-type single phase transformer with substantial magnetic core saturation. The comparison between the two discretization schemes is based on an equal number of finite element and finite difference domains. The finite element mesh is superimposed on the finite difference grid, to assure an equitable basis of comparison. Aspects of flexibility of implementation and economics (computer execution time and storage requirements) for the two techniques are compared. In addition, the degree of agreement between numerical results of the two methods and corresponding experimental test data is given."
"The spatial frequency response of gapped reproduce heads with finite depth and finite pole length (i.e., rectangular in cross-section) is determined by superposition of approximate solutions for zero depth and infinite depth-heads. The approach yields computationally simple formulae which are compared with frequency response deduced by analogy from electrostatic experiments with conducting paper. The approach to zero frequency is characterized by the responseS = k\\bar{c}wherekis the wave number (2\\pi/\\lambda) and\\bar{c}the average of the length plus depth of the head. Increased head depth can result in improved low frequency response without changing the basic \"head bump\" spectrum."
"Digital recording is usually achieved by driving the record-head core material to only 30-40% of its saturation magnetization. Saturation of the core material will occur only when attempting to record on magnetic media of very high coercive force. Magnetic recording materials with coercive forces of 1100, 1800, and 3600 oersteds have been investigated for low-density digital recording on magnetic-stripe cards. Two record heads of identical construction but different core materials, mumetal and a high-saturation-magnetization iron-cobalt alloy, were used for recording 165 flux changes per cm (420 fci). The initiation of pole-tip saturation in both heads was detected by the decrease in inductance. The mumetal head was unable to fully record either the 1800 or 3600-Oe coercive-force materials because of pole-tip saturation. The high-field head recorded all materials."
"The design, fabrication and output characteristics of a thin film Permalloy magnetoresistive magnetic field sensor in a balanced bridge configuration are described. The bridge elements consist of two magnetostatically coupled Permalloy films (100 to 500 A°) separated by a thin film titanium spacer (100 to 1,000 A°). When this bridge is integrated with electrically isolated overlay conductors, the resulting device is ideally suited to sense currents in power supply applications over a 0 to 100 MHz frequency range with negligible dc offset. Devices with 35 mV peak outputs optimized to sense 50, 250 and 500 mA peak currents have been implemented and tested."
 "The design of the magnetic frequency changer, or multiductor, has advanced to the extent that units having a rating of 6.6 MW have recently been designed and built. This paper treats several of the problems and consequent solutions encountered in the design of these large units. Specifically, problems associated with the effective utilization of available conductor in a sheet wound coil are discussed, and methods of reducing the losses to acceptable levels are described. It is shown that excessive losses can occur when the winding geometry is improperly chosen. Secondly, methods of estimating the core losses at the high and distorted flux densities encountered in the frequency changer are described. The load dependent core losses are required when determining the efficiency of the device as well as in assessing the overall system stability. Finally, an efficient method of simulating the behaviour of the multiductor on load is outlined. The simulation includes the input filter network, line characteristics, losses, etc. It is such that sets of design curves or alternatively, specific design configurations, can each be treated with ease and economy."
"The properties of permanent magnets based on RCo5compounds arise from their strong uniaxial anisotropy. The anisotropy field at 4.2 K in YCo5is about 200 kOe. A polarized neutron study of YCo5revealed a very large orbital contribution to the magnetic moment on the CoI(2c) site, which indicates that the major part of the cobalt anisotropy originates from this site. The variations of the magnetic anisotropy of YCo5which occur when different substitutional atoms (Ni, Fe, Co pairs) modify the ideal structure, are in agreement with this view."
"This paper deals with the methodology of magnet technology and its application to various engineering devices. Magnet technology has experienced a rapid growth in the past few years as a result of the advances made in superconductivity, numerical methods and computational techniques. Specifically, this paper concerns itself with: (a) Mathematical models for solving magnetic field problems; (b) The applicability, usefulness, and limitations of computer programs that utilize these models; (c) Examples of application in various engineering disciplines; (d) Areas where further contributions are needed. The author hopes that this paper will facilitate the communication of information between scientists and engineers, and the exchange of new ideas."
"The discontinuity in the hard direction magnetisation curve for the alloy Pr2(Co0.6Fe0.4)17has been studied over the temperature rauge 5K-300K using a partially aligned polycrystalline sample. By means of the singular point detection technique we have measured the temperature variation of the anisotropy field and also the position of the magnetisation discontinuity. We conclude that the discontinuity is associated with a first-order rotation of the magnetisation vector, and its appearance as temperature is lowered is due to the rapid decrease of the second anisotrcpy constant K2to below a negative value K2= -K1/6. Analysis of the anisotropy constants obtained by Shanley for a Pr2(Co0.8Fe0.2)17alloy enable a good estimate to be made of the position of the anomalous discontinuity for this alloy."
 "We describe various explosive magnetic flux compression devices that produce pulsed megagauss fields, and a number of applications in which they have been used. Among the systems described are relatively simple ones that generate fields up to 250 T in large fixed volumes, and cylindrical implosion systems that produce fields in excess of 1000 T. Small fixed volume systems are described that may be used in the laboratory. They require only small amounts of explosive and can produce 100 T fields in coils 25 mm long and 10 mm diameter. We discuss measurements made on various materials in megagauss fields, often at cryogenic temperatures, including magnetoresistance, magnetic susceptibility, optical absorption, Faraday rotation, and Zeeman splittings. We also discuss experiments in which large magnetic pressures have been used to compress solid deuterium isentropically. In flux compression devices part of the energy of the explosives is converted to electromagnetic energy. This has led to their use as compact single-shot high power energy sources. At times, it is necessary to transformer couple loads to the device outputs. We describe successful operation of transformers in 165 T fields, and suggest that they can operate in much higher fields."
"Substrate misorientation of an epitaxial garnet film induces an in-plane anisotropy, which in turn causes a domain wall velocity anisotropy. We have measured velocity anisotropies in weakly and moderately misoriented films using a high speed optical sampling microscope. The in-plane anisotropy axis determined from bubble radial expansion measurements agrees reasonably well with theory. Subsequently, we have measured domain stretch velocities in two orthogonal chevron expanders fabricated on the misoriented films with one expander nearly parallel and the other nearly perpendicular to the in-plane easy axis. It is found that domain stretch velocities are indeed anisotropic with the velocity difference in two orthogonal stretch directions nearly equal to that between the two anisotropic saturation velocities in the bubble radial expansion measurements. However, the domain stretch velocities themselves are much larger than the radial saturation velocities. This discrepancy may be attributed to the presence of an in-plane field in the device."
"A direct measurement of bubble stretch-out velocity on a chevron detector can be performed by studying the detector signal as a function of the number of periods over which stretch-out has taken place. For about a 10% range of bias field, a long stretched out domain will shrink into a bubble without popping when the rotating field is turned off. When the rotating field is turned back on, the bubble will expand and will give a detector signal proportional to its stretched out length. A velocity can be calculated from the rate, of detector signal increase per number of chevron periods allowed for expansion. The stretch-out velocity is related to drive and bias field amplitude. An estimate of domain mobility can be made by fitting to a simple model experimental velocity dependence on drive and bias fields. Data from three different garnet materials with stretch-out velocities between 2000 and 5800 cm/s at 35 Oersted peak triangular drive show that meaningful comparisons between different materials can be made."
"Computer tested magnetic bubble chips have been assembled into dual-in-line packages (DIPs). In order to insure that stringent telephone station apparatus specifications are met, many packages have been subjected to extensive functional and environmental tests. From the functional tests average values and standard deviations of operating parameters at minimum rotating field over the temperature range of -25°C to +50°C have been determined. Environmental tests included temperature cycling (-40°C to +65°C), thermal shock, high temperature at high humidity (85% humidity/85°C), and mechanical shock and vibration. Of the 74 packages subjected to all environmental tests, 48 (or 64.9%) passed. Data indicate the package design to be good in terms of meeting operational, shock and vibration requirements; however, improvements in bond reliability are indicated."
"A 28-μm period, all chevron bubble memory using 6-μm diameter domains in Y1.32Sm.38Lu.38Ca.92Fe4.08Ge.92O12was operated at 100 kHz from -45° to +100°C with suitably chosen pulse and drive field amplitudes. At high drive currents the minimum all-function bias range among 4 accessible storage loops in the major-track, minor loop organized memory increased from 12G at -45°C to 17G for a broad maximum about room temperature and then decreased to 6G at 100°C. The behavior of bias margins with temperature and drive-current amplitude is shown. The stretch, cut, and annihilation-pulse operating ranges decrease with increasing temperature. Delay tolerances for the annihilation and cut pulses are shown as a function of the temperature."
"A new magnetic amplifier utilizing temperature dependence of coercive force is presented in this paper. Operations of the magnetic amplifier are explained well in an analysis based on a simple assumption. For amplifiers using temperature-sensitive Co-ferrite core, two useful control characteristics are obtained, one is that the load current varies linearly with temperature and the other is that it changes rapidly at the desired temperature."
"Analytical and experimental results of thermomagnetic characteristics of cores composed of temperature-sensitive magnetic materials, such as flux density, coercive force and permeability, are discussed in this paper. The hysteresis loops of the composed cores were analyzed according to a graphical method based on a simple assumption. The theoretical values and experimental ones show a good agreement. A useful magnetic characteristic, which would not be achieved by any of the components alone, was obtained."
"Ferromagnetic liquid, also called ferrofluid, is used extensively at the present time as a leakproof fluid seal between regions of different pressure. Ferrofluid \"plugs\" have been proposed to facilitate blood flow stasis in arteries during surgery as an alternative to present methods which cause arterial wall damage. The hydrostatic loading of ferrofluid is investigated theoretically and experimentally for liquid and air pressure loading. It is found that the Bernoulli equation, modified to account for magnetic field-ferrofluid coupling, adequately predicts the sealing capacity of the hydrostatic plug when the ferrofluid surfaces are in stable equilibrium. General criteria are outlined for the determination of the stability of various liquid-liquid and gas-liquid configurations. Loading measurements are independently correlated by vibrating magnetometer measurements."
  "The Curie point writing in the amorphous ferrimagnetic films are described. The bits written on the films with relatively large values of4\\piM_{s}are unsaturated. We could write and erase the saturated bits on the film with low values of4\\piM_{s}with a low external field. The magnetic reversal profile inside the bits can be explained by the \"self\" demagnetizing field originating within the reversed region itself."
"High gradient magnetic separators have been pilot tested for the removal of fine suspended solids from wastewaters of two Swedish steel mills. The first research into the use of these magnetic separators for wastewater treatment in the steel industry was conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of the American Iron and Steel Institute [1] and Sala[2]. The results generated interest in exploring this technology further in certain Swedish and U.S. steel manufacturing companies. More extensive laboratory tests in Sweden led to on-site pilot testing at two mills in Sweden, NJA and Granges Nyby Bruk. The SALA-HGMSTMModel 10-15-20 Automatic High Gradient Magnetic Separator was operated on feed to and overflow from scale pits fed by hot rolling mill cooling and scarfing waters. These waters contained up to 150 mg/l of suspended solids. Tests were conducted at magnetic field strengths from 0.1 to 0.9 T (1 to 9kG) and at flow velocities between 145 and 800 m/h. The results show that filtration efficiencies of over 90% are achieved with the Sala high gradient magnetic separator at process velocities many times higher than those in conventional treatment processes."
"An apparatus for the production of amorphous alloy ribbon is described. The alloy is induction-melted in a small quartz crucible and ejected by argon gas pressure through a small orifice in the bottom of the crucible. The liquid jet impinges at a small angle with respect to a radius of a copper disk rotating at several thousand rev/min, flattens while rapidly cooling and solidifying, and leaves the circumferential surface of the disk as a result of centrifugal force. The resulting ribbon geometry for an alloy of Fe40Ni40B20has been studied as a function of orifice sizes between 340 and 480 μm in diameter, of disk speeds between 5 and10 \\times 10^{3}rev/min (20 and 40 m/sec), and of ejection pressures between 4 and 10 psig (28 and 70 kPa). The cross-sectional area of the ribbon can be predicted quite accurately from the disk speed, the orifice diameter, and the velocity of the liquid jet as given by the Bernoulli equation. Experimental data are in the form of ribbon thicknesses, ranging between 10 and 40 μm, and mass/ length, ranging between 0.05 and 0.24 mg/mm. None of the ribbons produced showed any signs of crystallinity, as determined by X-ray diffraction."
"A technique to determine the frequency dependent record losses for contact as well as non-contact interfaces has been devised. Measurement of these losses in contact recording is normally accomplished by the use of two different interface speeds in order to factor out wavelength dependent effects; however, this method is undesirable in non-contact disc recording where flying height variations as a function of interface speed are normally encountered. To overcome this problem, the recording process is linearized by a.c. bias and intermodulation products between different frequencies are observed. The loss can be established from the amount by which the record current is increased as a function of frequency in order to maintain a constant level intermodulation product. Both two and three tone intermodulation techniques were investigated and the latter was found superior. Measurements obtained on a flying head/disc interface show, as expected, that the frequency dependent losses are essentially independent of radius and record level."
 "Many video recording heads are fabricated from electrically conductive, magnetic alloys and are operated at frequencies where the skin depth is small compared with head dimensions. We present a novel theory wherein it is assumed that flux flows only in a skin layer which covers all the surfaces of the head. The gap regions are treated as magnetic transmission lines. Computations of the head inductance compare well with experiment. This model is simple enough to be readily applied to the design of other heads made from conductive materials."
"The formation of strontium hexaferrite SRFE12O19from pure iron oxide and strontium carbonate has been studied by means of dynamic high temperature X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and thermogravimetry. The formation in air passes through two endothermal reactions: SrCo3+6α-Fe2O3+(0.5-x)\\frac{1}{2}O2→ SrCo3+5.5α-Fe2O3+CO2(A) SrFeO3-x+5.5α-Fe2O3→ SrFe12O19+(0.5-x)\\frac{1}{2}O2(B) The solid state reaction of the formation of the perovskite SrFeO3-xstarts between 660 C (0.13°/min) and 730 C (20°/min) depending on the heating rate. Above 810 C or 1000 C, resp., the perovskite reacts with the excess iron oxide forming the hexaferrite. During the process a part of the iron becomes tetravalent and is again reduced into the trivalent state. The phase Sr7Fe10O22or Sr4Fe6O13, resp., observed in quenched samples could not be detected during the formation in air."
"High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) has been applied to the removal of ash-forming mineral matter and sulfur in the form of pyrites from solvent refined coal. These materials occur as suspended solids which are very finely divided in the product of a liquifaction pilot plant. The pyrites contain part of the total sulfur found in the coal. The rest is bound organically in the coal structure. Actual pilot plant process conditions are simulated in a continuous-flow high-pressure system which feeds the liquified coal at 500°F to a ferromagnetic matrix centered in the bore of a Bitter solenoid. Field values of up to 100 kOe have been used although lower fields would be dictated if conventional magnets are to be used commercially. Results indicate that the removal of ash and inorganic sulfur increase with magnetic field and decrease with flow rate. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1 where the percentage reduction in sulfur in the filtrate is plotted against H/v. H is the applied magnetic field in kOe and v is the flow velocity in cm/ min. This parameter is derived from the ratio of magnetic force to the viscous drag force of the carrier fluid. Data for use in pilot plant design have been collected."

"Thin films of Co, Ni and their alloys were prepared by ion plating. Metals were evaporated in an Ar gas atmosphere of about 0.01 torr, while applying a dc electric field of 2 kV/ 15 cm between the substrate and the evaporation source. Since metal atoms, which were given large kinetic energy by the gas plasma, impinged on the surface of the substrate, a strong adhesion between the ferromagnetic film and the substrate could be obtained. By changing the Ar gas pressure, the coercive force of the film could be controlled up to a maximum of 500 Oe and also by choosing the constituents of the mother alloys. Magnetoresistance of the film was also measured. The change of the resistance was 2.1%, when the cobalt concentration was 50 %."
"In today's most advanced disk systems, of all the factors which contribute time shifts of the data pulses that impinge on the decodable window margin required for reliable signal detection-peak shifts of the pulses due to demagnetization effects, timing dislocations due to media and system noise, and track positioning errors resulting in timing distortions from adjacent tracks or from incomplete erasure of the previously recorded information-the latter perhaps represents the major source of timing errors. In this study we used the Dynamic Iterative Model to obtain signal waveforms which were then superposed to determine track interaction effects and assess the implications, particularly for the case of high resolution systems and where high frequency unwanted signals are injected into a low frequency data track."
"A new type of the HGMS filter is proposed in which the slurry flows parallel to the ferromagnetic fine wires (Parallel stream type magnetic filter). In this configuration, the capturing magnetic force scarcely competes with the drag force or the gravitational force. The recovery of the filter is calculated based on the particle trajectory model. The experimental result for hematite slurry agrees well with the present theory. A preliminary result is presented on the maintenance test of the filter recovery. This filter is expected to be easy to flush."
"The anisotropy of the RCo5-based compounds depends not only on the local anisotropies but also on exchange interactions of the Sm and Co sublattices. This result allows an accurate determination of the Sm3+anisotropy in SmCo5and SmCo3.5Cu1.5; the anisotropic properties of these compounds are discussed in terms of crystal field. The mechanism of domain wall displacement has been studied on a single crystal of SmCo3.5Cu1.5by means of Kerr effect and high field magnetization measurements. Domain walls are trapped in copper rich regions where exchange and anisotropy are lower. Magnetic aftereffect measurements show that in fact the trapping effect is in competition with a kink creation mechanism. On this basis, the thermal variation of the coercive field of the SmCo5-based compound is explained."
"A statistical model is developed to describe the orientation of particle easy axes with respect to the alignment direction in sintered SmCo5magnets. The model can be used to describe the three-dimensional orientation distributions measured by Swift et al [1]. using x-ray techniques, and with appropriate modification, the two-dimensional orientation distributions measured metallographically by Martin [2]. The distribution is described by a single parameter β, analogous to the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution. For a given β, the model predicts the ratio of remanence to saturation and also the shape of the magnetization curve measured in decreasing fields when the field is applied perpendicular to the alignment axis. The effective anisotropy and the value of β can be determined by comparison of experimental and calculated curves."
"The saturation magnetization, Curie temperature, easy direction of magnetization and anisotropy field of Er2Co17-xMxcompounds where M = Fe, Mn or Ni were investigated. It was not possible to prepare single phase materials for x > 6 when M = Mn and for x > 10 when M = Ni. The Mn containing ternaries possess an easy direction of magnetization along the c-axis whereas for Fe containing ternaries the easy direction changes from c-axis to basal plane for x > 10. In the case of Er2Co17-xNixthe easy direction changes from c-axis to basal plane with nickel substitution and the remains along the basal plane until x = 8 at which concentration the spins prefer the c-axis. At low temperatures Er2Fe11Co6, Er2Co15Ni2, and Er2Co11Co6show a tendency to deviate from the easy plane. The Curie temperature decreases with M substitution and the decrease is rapid when M = Mn. Er2Co15Mn2possess an anisotropy field of 133 kOe at 4.2 K as compared to 31 kOe for Er2Co17Ni. A model is proposed to explain the easy axis change as a function of M."
"In Sm3+ion the energy separation between the ground multiplet level and the first excited multiplet level is small and therefore the exchange and crystal fields can considerably admix these levels. As a result of this admixture by exchange fields alone, the Sm3+magnetization in magnetically ordered compounds changes sign or shows a crossover at a temperature of about 300 K. Thus in samarium compounds with transition elements, where the transition element has a moment, the samarium moment couples parallel to transition element moment below 300 K and antiparallel above 300 K. We have investigated the effects of crystal fields (of hexagonal symmetry) on Sm3+magnetization and find that the crossover temperature in magnetization is considerably altered by crystal fields (and also by exchange fields in the presence of crystal fields) from the value of 300 K for free Sm3+ion. The magnetization results on SmCo5are discussed in the light of these calculations."
"A numerical method is described, which is used for static and dynamic calculations of electromagnetic actuators. The mathematical model consists of three systems representing the electric, magnetic, and mechanical components, which are governed by coupled differential equations for coil current, magnetic vector potential, and armature displacement. As yet, only magnets with rotational symmetry have been considered and eddy currents have been neglected. The non-linear partial differential equation for the magnetic vector potential is solved by finite difference techniques using the line iteration method with overrelaxation of the vector potential and underrelaxation of the reluctivity. Acceleration of convergence is achieved by the multiplicative method based on Ampere's law. For the solution of the electric and mechanical differential equations, inductances and forces are calculated from the magnetic field distribution. A computer program based on these techniques is outlined. It automatically adapts the finite difference grid to the time-varying geometry and chooses the surface of integration for the evaluation of the magnetic force. Some calculations are discussed, which were performed to assist the design of print needle actuators."
"Waveform compensation by cosine equalizer, which is simple in composition, was applied to digital magnetic recording in order to improve recording density. The equalizer is composed of a delay line with delay constant τ, an amplitude divider with dividing ratio K and a differential amplifier. There are optimum combinations of K and τ to obtain minimum pulse width with minimum amplitude reduction. Half pulse width was found to be reduced to about 0.6, with an optimum combination of K and τ. This means that an effective increase of recording density by about 60% or more is obtained. Pulse crowding is reduced in accordance with the reduction of the half width of an isolated pulse. However, it was found that practicable increase of the recording density is reduced to about 30%, as an example, when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the input is 35 dB. In case of a lower SNR, the recording density limit is rather decreased, when level sensing is applied as a signal detection method."
"A new method of generating high pulsed magnetic field up to about 1 MOe without destroying coils is described. The magnet consists of multi-layer coils which were designed so as to share the strong Maxwell stress within their tensile strength. A small 4-layer model magnet was tested and the maximum field of 1.07 MOe with the pulse width of 0.18 m sec. was obtained without destroying the coil. A three-years project of constructing a high magnetic field laboratory based on the new idea is proceeding in Osaka University. A 1.5 M Joule energy source is used to produce up to 1 M0e within a volume of 20mmD × 20 mm and low temperature experiments will be possible after two years. At present, however, the experiments at liquid helium temperature are limited up to 0.5 MOe. The submillimeter electron spin resonance experiments under the strong field were done using HCN and H2O lasers and the determination of exchange constant between dissimilar spins was done. New terms, H2S2, H2SI and H3S in the spin Hamiltonian are also discussed. Magnetization measurements in metals and compounds are reported."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"A set of rules, equations and relations are given for the effects of coherent and statistical noise on digital recorders. Simple formulas, intended for laboratory use, are given for the change in signal to noise ratio (SNR) caused by the channel. Bit error probability is related to SNR and channel parameters for the zero-crossing detector channels typical of digital computer disk and tape recorders, and many digital instrumentation recorders. Valid and invalid ways to calculate error rate statistics are discussed for situations where bit errors are correlated, i.e. not statistically independent."
"Using mixtures of Co-Fe-Ni alloy particles with different coercivity populations, or mixtures of the alloy particles with other particulate ferro- or ferri-magnetic materials (also of differing coercivities), we have made magnetic recording media with little magnetic interaction between the two or more particle populations. Average coercivities of these separate particle populations need only be 200 Oe apart in order that \"multimodal\" action is achieved. Such multimodal media are characterized by successive pseudomajor hysteresis loops, which expand stepwise with the maximum applied field. Such recording media can contain as many sets of signals as the number of modes, the sets being eraseable in sequence independently of higher mode signals. Uses of such media include masking of a wanted signal recorded in a higher mode with another (meaningless) signal recorded in a lower mode, or the dubbing of editing information (which can later be erased). Since the mixing of iron or chromium oxide particles of widely differing coercivities does not generally yield a multimodal medium, the magnetic interaction in our systems is undoubtedly not the same as in the oxide systems."
"Thermomagnetic writing in amorphous Tb-Fe films prepared by thermal evaporation or rf-sputtering is described. These films have a low Curie temperature (75°C) and large values of coercive force over the wide range of temperature. Spots are thermomagnetically written and erased by using a He-Ne laser in conjunction with external magnetic field, and 1 ∼ 2 micron spots are written stably with low laser power. At this writing, a new property was found, that is, the Kerr contrast of the spots gradually varies with a value of the external magnetic field. Temperature dependences of coercive force and magnetization, spot diameter as a function of writing laser power and the Kerr contrast of spots as a function of external magnetic field are reported."
"A few new modulation codes(or run-length-limited codes) in digital magnetic recording is presented. Linear density limits of the new codes and the existing codes are evaluated for a typical recording channel. One of the new codes shows the highest linear density limit among the existing codes and is improved over, for example, MFM and 4/5-rate-NRZI codes by about 20% to 30% in the density limit for the channel. A method for constructing the new codes is presented."
"x-ray and electron microscope techniques have been used in attempts to determine the orientation degree of magnetic recording tapes; except for CrO2tapes, the results have not been unambiguous. We have applied the Mössbauer transmission method to evaluate quantitatively the particle orientation of γ-Fe2O3tapes. The principle involved is the intensity ratio of the middle to the outer lines of the Fe57Mössbauer spectrum for various geometrical arrangements. The samples consist of tapes with different packing factors and various magnetic-field treatments. The observations clearly establish the degree of orientation; it is moderate. Analyses of spectra both for in-plane and out-of-plane orientations provide information on the particle morphology. The two main conclusions are the following. One: the out-of-plane deviation is determined predominantly by packing factors; it is almost independent of applied magnetic fields for the range from 0.6 to 1.4 kOe. Two: the in-plane alignment is, to some extent, improved by applying a magnetic field."
"The utilization of superconducting field windings in large ac generators gives promise of reduced size and weight, increased efficiency and better electrical characteristics over conventional copper-iron machines. This new concept in application to central station power generation could lead to machines with ratings beyond the limits set by present technology and even at present day ratings may have economic advantage. Also the low weight to power ratio of this type of machine makes it attractive for advanced airborne systems. Because of these attractive characteristics, the engineering schools and the large generator manufacturers throughout the world have initiated programs to evaluate this concept. These programs range from machine design to system studies up to construction and test of prototype demonstration machines. The present paper will first review the general concept of a superconducting generator in contrast with a present day copper-iron machine and then outline the potential advantages of this new concept, both technical and economic. Based on design studies and test results of the prototype machines, critical development problems that can be anticipated for future, larger generators will be reviewed with special emphasis on those aspects associated with the superconducting field winding."
"In using flexible disks at high speed (linear speed of the order of 20 m/s) one has to deal with two gas films : one that holds the disk in position and an other that maintains a constant spacing (order 1 μm) between the disk and the head(s). Two devices realizing the first function are described in this paper : one using a nozzle blowing air toward the disk and one using the centrifugal flow between the disk and nearby wall. Concerning the air film between head and disk, an interferometric method was devised to measure the spacing and the deflection of the disk. The geometry and settings of the head are discussed. These results were used in designing the heads of a prototype of a small fixed head digital memory."
 "Single-crystal thin films of cobalt-ferrite with large perpendicular anisotropy were grown on MgO substrates. The films are represented by the general formula CoxFe3-xO4. The flux reversal mechanism, the main magnetic and magnetooptic parameters of these films were studied over the wide composition range. Bit-by-bit and holographic Curie point writing were made on cobalt-ferrite films. The films possess some unique advantages in comparison with MnBi films. Write energy and diffraction efficiency of cobalt-ferrite films were measured and calculated. The films are found to be suitable for magnetooptic memory applications."
 "The wavelength dependences of loss and phase, as functions of write-head-to-medium separation, are calculated for an AC-biased recording model which assumes a longitudinal magnetization that increases linearly with depth. For a penetration distance ymand a write separationb, the read-voltage loss is\\lgroup(1 + kb) - (1 + ky_{m}) e^{-k(y_{m}-b)}\\rgroup /ky_{m}, as compared with the usual thickness loss1 - e^{-k(y_{m}-b)}. The phase function is found by calculating the mean longitudinal position at which recording occurs vs. depth, weighted by the exponential read-distance loss. The resulting integrals cannot be solved in closed form, but series approximations allow numerical evaluation. Calculated loss and phase curves are shown for various relative separations."
"Orientation distribution function data for three primary recrystallized textures of 3% Si-Fe were obtained. These data make it possible to determine the amounts of each orientation present in the textures. The processing variations for the three materials were as follows: two-stage cold-rolling with MnS grain-growth inhibitor, single-stage cold rolling with MnS inhibitor, and single-stage cold rolling with AlN and MnS inhibitors. After final processing, the single stage material with AlN and MnS produced a high permeability (\\mu_{10}=1915) while the two-stage material with MnS produced a permeability of 1835. Both of these materials underwent complete secondary recrystallization to the cube-on-edge orientation. The single-stage material with MnS did not undergo secondary recrystallization. The orientation distribution data showed that cube-on-edge was the strongest single component in the primary texture for the two-stage material. Cube-on-edge was a minor component in both single-stage primary textures. Further data on all three primary textures are presented."
"Computer analysis for dynamic domain size variation in grain-oriented 3% Si-Fe tape-wound cores is, first, presented by using a principle of minimization of total free energy, the sum of magnetostatic energy at grain boundaries and dynamic bowing domain-wall energy, and by using quasi-static permeability as a function of peak flux density. Second, iron losses per cycle, Wi/f, in the cores are calculated and compared with experimental results: the origin of 'anomalous loss' is quantitatively clarified; Wi/f becomes minimum at certain value of tape thickness; Wi/f is smaller at 'voltage excitation'; and instantaneous domain-wall profiles and energy loss are illustrated. An experimental result for reduction of iron losses by scratching method is also shown."
"A magnetic bubble mass memory system containing many chips may be configured in different ways. At one extreme, all the required chips are placed inside one drive coil set and one bias magnet. At the other extreme, each chip is placed in its own drive coil set and bias magnet, and the many single chip magnetic modules are then combined to form a mass memory system. This paper will compare these different approaches in terms of system volume and system power specifications. A generalized model will be described in order to compare these choices in configuration using a uniform set of packaging constraints."
"Dry reed contacts typically fall into two categories, the nonself-latching and the self-latching types. Historically, the nonself-latching was the first developed and Fe-Ni alloys have found wide acceptance as the reed material. More recently, the self-latching contact has received widespread attention from the communications industry, motivated by potential reductions in physical size and energy consumption. This has stimulated studies into new magnetic alloy development and into material processing modifications, on both newly developed as well as previously known alloys, to meet the stringent properties requirements. The emphasis of this review is on the self-latching contact focusing on its requirements, the magnetic materials which have the potential to meet these requirements, and the sometimes intricate processing steps which have been developed to realize the potential. Alloys in the Co-Fe-Nb, Co-Fe-V, Co-Fe-Ni-Al, and several other families which are principally precipitation-type permanent-magnet materials are considered."
"The head/tape interface in a rotating head configuration is investigated as a function of head contour design and physical parameters using stroboscopic white light interferometry. The parameters determining optimum flying behavior are discussed, and it is shown that stable air bearing spacings in the submicron region can be achieved."
 "HGMS involves the impingement and attachment of particles of varying magnetic susceptibility on fine ferromagnetic fibers placed in a homogeneous background field. A model was developed to allow numerical calculation of capture radii of the fibers for Various particles under the influence of magnetic, gravitational, hydrodynamic and inertial forces. Both the magnetic and flow fields are calculated for an elliptical fiber to simulate approximately real shapes. For almost all practical cases of HGMS, the Reynolds numbers will be in the region intermediate between purely viscous and potential flow (Re 0.1-40). Therefore, a boundary layer is superimposed upon the solution for potential flow. The effect of loading on the capture radius may be evaluated by adjusting the flow pattern to allow for particle build-up."
"The Curie temperature, Tc, of (Fe100-xMx)0.75P0.16B.06Al.03glasses with M = Ni, Mo or Cr were measured. Tcof the glasses increases monotonically with annealing temperature Ta. The rate of increase,dT_{c}/dT_{a}, however, exhibits maxima atT_{a} = 500and 600 K; temperatures at which the structural relaxation spectra also exhibit peaks. At lower temperatures, Tcincreases at rates that are greater than those of structural relaxation processes. Since the low and high temperature relaxation peaks may be attributed to local atomic regroupings and cooperative atomic rearrangements, respectively, the present results imply that the magnetic properties of metallic glasses are more sensitive to changes in local atomic arrangement than to longer ranged correlations. The change in Tcis larger for the Ni containing glasses than for glasses containing Mo, Cr, or Mn."
"The processing of the new breed of high permeability silicon steels is characterized by a final cold reduction which is appreciably higher than that of the conventional product. This severe cold reduction leads to the formation of \"transition bands,\" i.e., areas of extreme lattice curvature and of highest stored energy. Subgrains or areas with"
"The vertical sections of the Fe-Cr-Co system at 15wt%Co + 3wt%V, at 15wt%Co + 5wt%V, and at 15wt%Co + 3wt%V + 2wt%Ti are constructed. The extension of the α phase region of the system at 15%Co and 5%V, and at 15%Co and 3%V + 2%Ti is enough to allow for the solution treatment of the alloys with 21∼23%Cr at any temperature above the\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}miscibility gap. After step-tempering, their magnetic properties are given as Br=13.5 KG (1.35T), Hc=550 Oe (44kA/m) and (BH)max=5.5 MGOe (44kJ/m3). The addition of V or V + Ti to the Fe-Cr-Co system can facilitate the practical manufacture of permanent magnets."
"A state space model is developed in terms of magnetic vector potential (M.V.P.),\\bar{A}, for the calculation of instantaneous values of eddy currents, flux penetration, and losses in nonlinear solid ferromagnetics. Finite differences in space and sampled data techniques in time are used to obtain the solutions. This formulation is very effective in simplifying the computer programming implementation to electrical machinery problems, which contain a mixture of regions of air-gaps and conductors. An application of this technique to a solid steel damper bar in a salient-pole synchronous machine of the type used in hydroelectric pumped-storage stations is presented. Resulting damper bar losses, due to sinusoidal excitation are given and found to be in good agreement with experimental test data. Also, instantaneous flux density and current density wave forms are given for various depths into the bar with vivid display of the effects of nonlinearity. Equivalent bar resistances and reactances determined by the present method are compared with corresponding results obtained by earlier techniques. Favorable comparison is achieved."
"A bubble propagating structure that operates well on a 14 μm to 18 μm propagate period with a nominal 2 μm minimum feature size has been designed. The structure consists of only 1 discrete permalloy feature per circuit period. Sixty-eight kbit-capacity memory chips based on such structures have been designed, built, characterized, packaged and the packages have been characterized. The chip is organized as a set of minor (storage) loops with separate write and read major lines. The bubble manipulating functions, of which the replicate and transfer gates are the most critical, have also been designed with 2 μm minimum features. The design is adequate to provide a 14 Oe bias field margin range with drive fields of about 35 Oe, using a bubble garnet material with approximately 170 Oe free bubble collapse field. Sixty-eight kbit single loop shift register type chips designed using similar propagating structures, however, provide over 20 Oe bias field margin ranges with drive fields of about 35 Oe."
 "A 100K bit, five micron, major/minor loop device was characterized for operation from 0 to +70°C in order to specify the tolerances on the interface circuitry. The device was operated in a magnetically self-contained module with a temperature-compensated bias field. A description is given of the computerized test apparatus, its high-level bubble test language, and the process parameters of the bubble device. The nominal operating parameters are given, with timing phases referenced to the triangular drive current waveforms. Operation was characterized with respect to variation of all parameters and permissible limits on these parameters are given for 0 to +70°C operation. Longevity data are given for major loop and minor loop propagation under stop/start and continuous conditions."
 "Burrows permeameter, once the standard apparatus for magnetic testing and later abandoned due to its tedious operation, has been revived by applying electronics for automatic compensation using magnetometers as sensors of leakage flux. A study of basic sources of error; i.e., stray fields from compensation coils, indicates a potential accuracy of 0.1% or better at measured relative permeability of the order of 5000. To reduce errors due to eddy currents in the samples, sophisticated digital equipment was developed to control the magnetizing current."
"To increase recording density while maintaining satisfactory data reliability, optimum channel filters are designed by taking into account the effects of intersymbol interference and noise simultaneously. The concept of eye pattern, used in communication theory, is utilized for evaluating the effect of intersymbol interference. The eye patterns are calculated assuming linear superposition of individual reproduced pulses. Filter parameters are optimized by employing an iterative approximation method so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the worst-case data. The results show that channel equalizations are effective for an amplitude detection system but not effective for a peak detection system. The recording density limits for several recording systems are also obtained."
"Effects of deformation and annealing on the magnetic anisotropy, stress relief rate, and fracture strain of amorphous alloys Fe80B20and Fe40Ni40P14B6were studied. It was found that deformation increases the anisotropy and the stress relief rate, while annealing reduces them. The results are shown to be consistent with the existence of structural defects in the amorphous alloys."
"The rapid development of research on the physics of liquid crystals in recent years is largely due to the application of knowledge, ideas, and experimental techniques from various aspects of solid state physics to these unusual materials. For those studying phase changes, response to external fields, and defect structures in liquid crystals, analogies with magnetic materials have been especially stimulating. In turn, knowledge about liquid crystals has advanced to the point at which these analogies may serve to stimulate the thinking of magneticians as well. One of the more remarkable cases in point is that of the recently discovered ferroelectric liquid crystals. Although the fundamental molecular properties that result in ferroelectric phases are totally different from those of the common crystalline ferroelectrics, and of course even further from magnetic materials, many of the macroscopic properties of these materials are closely analogous to those of other ferroelectrics, and to properties of ferromagnetic materials as well."
"The processing of Permalioy field-access magnetic bubble devices will be discussed for lead-first, double level circuits emphasizing 5 μm diameter bubble circuits, but with reference to scaling down the process to 2 μm bubble diameter circuits. Device structures will be presented with typical material thicknesses and processes used for each level. A new bubble circuit based on the pickax replicator and the pickax propagation element will be introduced with emphasis on the relaxation of processing constraints that this circuit provides. Also quasi-static propagation margins for several of the key pickax elements will be presented."
"Low temperature measurements were made on commercially supplied InAs, InSb, and GaAs Hall probes in magnetic fields as high as 23 T. For fields above ∼6 T, the quantum oscillations observed for the GaAs probes were comparable in magnitude to those exhibited by the other two types, i.e.,\\lsim2%. At lower fields, the sensitivities of both the GaAs and InSb sensors were different from their respective high field values; this behavior was absent in the case of the InAs probes. All three types of probes shared the advantage of reasonably good reproducibility with respect to thermal cycling and magnetic field cycling."
"The application of a magnetic field parallel to a ferromagnetic film deposited on one side of a cantilevered substrate causes a small deflection of the free end. This deflection can be measured and the magnetostriction determined since the magnetostriction is proportional to the deflection. An instrument has been devised which can measure the deflection as a function of the applied field. This is accomplished as follows: the cantilevered substrate with the film on the upper side forms one plate of a capacitor which is part of the tuning capacitance of an oscillator operating at l0 MHz. The deflection of the free end causes a change in frequency of about 10 to 100 Hz. which is easily measured. The sign of the magnetostriction is immediately discernible from the increase or decrease in oscillator frequency. The instrument is calibrated by hanging a known weight from the free end of the substrate. Magnetostriction constants as small as3 \\times 10^{-7}and as large as40 \\times 10^{-6}have been measured."
"A new torque transducer of non-contact type with permanent magnets and a ring core is presented. If a torque is applied to the shaft, the twist deflection is transformed to a magnetic field of the circumferential direction in the tape wound core. The torque is measured by detecting this magnetic field through the ac bias applied to the core. With this new transducer the shaft torque can be measured not only in the rotating state but also in the stationary state."
"Volumetric photoionization in CO2-laser gas mixtures by UV emission from bare sparks was studied in two ways: by spectroscopic emission and absorption measurements, and by direct collection of photoionized electrons. The physical processes were understood sufficiently to permit prediction of initial electron distributions in arbitrary geometries of CO2, N2, He gas mixtures containing known concentrations of ionizable impurity."
"Output power versus current characteristics of a multiple-anode hollow-cathode He-I2laser have been studied using quasi-continuous excitation. Oscillation has been obtained on a total of 25 transitions of I+ranging in wavelength from the blue to near infrared and including 9 new CW transitions. For all transitions, upper level excitation is attributed to thermal-energy charge-transfer reactions. No saturation in laser output power has been detected for increasing discharge current up to 20 A in the 75-cm-long 2.5-mm-bore device. CW power levels up to 100 mW each for strong transitions and approaching 1 W total over all transitions have been achieved."
"This paper describes an experimental investigation of a pulsed CS2/O2chemical CO laser initiated in a high-pressure double-discharge TEA-laser system. A distributed volumetric discharge was obtained and yielded a maximum pulse energy of 115 mJ with a chemical efficiency of 4.5 percent, an electrical efficiency of 2.5 percent, and a specific output energy of 1 J/1. Experimental results and modeling calculations indicate that chain-branching production of O atoms does not occur under the experimental conditions investigated."
"Optical pumping of Nd:YAG by electrodeless are lamps is described. The lamps are annular, filled with 1-5-atm pressure of krypton and excited with 27-MHz electrical energy which is coupled to the lamp with approximately 80-percent efficiency. Optical energy is coupled from the lamp to the rod by a diffuse reflecting scheme. Overall efficiency and power output of the device are comparable to the dc-arc-lamp pumped case, while reliability and lifetime are greatly improved. The results of a successful 1000-h life test on a 25-W laser ate described."

"A simple but general formulation for the unified analysis of many different varieties of unstable optical resonators is obtained by expressing the round-trip Huygens' integral for the resonator in terms of the round-trip paraxial ray matrix. Complicated multielement resonators, ring resonators, and unstable resonators with variable-reflectivity output mirrors are thereby all reduced to a single equivalent collimated-beam diffraction problem. Essential assumptions in the analysis are that all elements in the resonator obey paraxial ray theory and that there is only one significant output coupler or limiting aperture per round trip inside the resonator. The only parameters needed to describe an arbitrary unstable resonator in this formulation are the round-trip magnificationMand either the equivalent Fresnel number Neqor else an equivalent collimated Fresnel numberN_{c} = [2M^{2}/(M^{2} - 1)] N_{eq}, plus for variable-reflectivity mirrors a specification of the mirror reflectivity profile."
"The kinetic processes controlling the conversion of CO2pump radiation into far-infrared (FIR) radiation in optically pumped waveguide lasers are discussed. It is found that pump saturation and excited-state FIR absorption play major roles in limiting the conversion. Good agreement between theory and experiment was obtained over a wide range of pump powers, gas pressures, and mirror reflectivities. For a well-optimized system, power-conversion efficiencies of 0.2-0.6 percent can be realistically achieved for CH3F."
"The ion spectra of He-CO-laser discharges with and without small addition of O2is presented. It is shown that upon addition of oxygen the dominant positive charge carriers in the discharge are O2+ions. It is argued that the oxygen ion O2+is populated in stage processes: thea^{3}\\Pistate of CO relaxes to a metastable state of oxygen, which in turn is ionized by electrons."
"Fluctuation spectra due to quantum shot noise in the output from a junction laser are calculated using rate equations for a non-uniform double-sectioned laser with a low quantum-efficiency region. The pumping-rate dependence of the fluctuation spectra for the non-uniform model is found to be roughly the same as that for the ordinary uniform model. The degradation process is then simulated using the uniform and nonuniform models, and it is shown that qualitatively opposite changes, decay or growth of resonance phenomena, are ex- pected in the fluctuations as the degradation proceeds uniformly or nonuniformly."
"Ninety-nine new far infrared (FIR) laser lines from 227 μm to 1.965 mm have been observed in CH3CN, CH3CCH, CH3Cl, CH3Br,and CH3I by optically pumping these gases with CO2-laser pulses of 150-μs duration."
"We have generated 1202.8-Å radiation, one-half the frequency of the1s^{1} S_{o}-2s^{1}S_{o}forbidden transition in He, using resonantly enhanced four-wave optical mixing in Hg vapor. Peak powers of 300 W in a ∼ 15-ps pulse have been achieved using a tunable narrow-band source consisting of a parametrically amplified commercial dye laser. The dependence of the conversion efficiency on the spectral properties of this source is described. Hg is shown to be negatively dispersive for this process, and thus phase matchable."
"Amplification of 10.6-μm radiation in a metallic waveguide and waveguide CO2-laser action was achieved by excitation of the CO2(0001) mode by vibrational energy transfer from metastableN\\min{2}\\max{\\ast}(\\upsilon = 1)molecules. Excitation of N2was accomplished in a separate dc discharge tube. The N2-He mixture, after flowing through the discharge region, was pumped into the waveguide and there CO2was added. Maximum small-signal gain values of 25.6 and 15.3 dB/m were obtained at amplifying waveguide sections of 2 and 6-cm length, respectively. A theoretical analysis, based on rate equations for the (0001) and the (1000) states of CO2and the concentration ofN\\min{2}\\max{\\ast}(\\upsilon = 1)molecules, is presented, which leads to predictions for the small-signal gain and the saturation intensity. In the pressure range covered by experiments the calculated gain values were found to be consistent with measurements."
"A modified distributed-feedback (DFB) laser, termed the multiply resonant distributed-feedback (MRDFB) laser, is described and demonstrated. The MRDFB-laser cavity incorporates a doubly periodic index-of-refraction variation which leads to the colinear generation of several preselected laser wavelengths simultaneously. A theoretical analysis of the MRDFB laser is given using the coupled-mode formalism, formulas are given for determining MRDFB-laser wavelengths, and estimates are made of required threshold gains. Experimental results obtained from MRDFB GaAs homojunction injection lasers are presented which verify important aspects of the theory."
"PassiveQswitching of IR lasers (N2O as well as CO2) has been applied for the detection of coincidences within a few 100 MHz between laser lines (νL) and molecular transitions (νM). Polar (12CH3F,13CH3F, C2H5OH, and C6H5CH3) as well as nonpolar molecules (SiH4, GeH4, CCl4, C2H4, C3H4, and C6H6) have been studied. The phenomenon depends strongly on the frequency mismatch\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_{M} - \\nu_{L}. 81combinations between laser lines and molecular absorption lines were found to produce theQ-switch effect."
"This paper summarizes analytical studies and the interpretation of experimental results for the compression and rarefaction waves generated in the cavity of a pulsed CO electric discharge laser. A one-dimensional analysis of acoustic waves is applied to a transversely excited laser. The influences of heating in the cathode fall, heat transfer to the cathode, flow through both the anode and cathode, and bulk heating of the plasma are included. The analysis is used to relate the bulk heating rate to observable features of the pressure and density waves. Data obtained from interferograms and reported elsewhere are used to infer the bulk heating rates in a pulsed CO laser. Results are presented for CO/Ar, CO/N2, and N2plasmas. Comparison of the data with recent theoretical results for the heating due to electron/ neutral collisions and the anharmonic defect associated withV-Venergy transfer shows substantial differences at lower values of total energy deposition. The change of heating WithE/Nis in fairly good agreement with predicted values."
"The lasing characteristics of separate-confinement-heterostructure (SCH-structure) distributed-feedback (DFB) diode lasers are examined theoretically and experimentally. Wave propagation in five-layer SCH waveguides is analyzed to estimate such parameters as the lasing wavelength, coupling constant, and external quantum efficiency. Spectral and modal behavior are studied in the experiment and compared with the theoretical predictions. Diodes are shown to lase in a single longitudinal mode with a definite polarization. Spectral width is about 300 MHz just above the threshold, and becomes wider with increased excitation level. An output power of 40 mW with an external quantum efficiency of 5 percent is obtained under CW operation."
"An approximation method has been developed to evaluate the perturbation theory expressions for the probabilities of two- and three-photon transitions among vibrational-rotational levels of diatomic and polyatomic molecules. The sum over intermediate rotational states and the degenerate quantum numberMis evaluated for a general case, and the sum over intermediate vibrational states for particular cases. The molecule is taken to be a rotating anharmonic oscillator. The electrical anharmonicity and the effects of the electronic states of the molecule are considered. Two- and three-photon processes, with or without the presence of near-resonant intermediate states, should be observable with available infrared lasers. However, the intensities predicted for the observation of three-photon excitation would result in more dominant effects such as dissociation or gas breakdown."
"We investigate spectral changes induced by high-power CO2laser radiation in the direct intervalence band absorption of p-type germanium. Using a model of inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems, we deduce a room-temperature saturation intensity of 4 MW/ cm2from published observations of saturation of this absorption. The applicability of the two-level model to transitions between two electronic bands is discussed. We relate the linear absorption coefficient to the saturation intensity and the effective population difference, where the latter is obtained in a spherical band approximation. The result yields a value of 0.55 ps for the geometric mean of the phase and energy relaxation times. The meaning of these times is explained for our system, and quantitative agreement is found with published data on optical and acoustical lattice scattering probabilities. Specifically, we find a very short phase relaxation time of 0.09 ps. This allows the prediction of a burnt-hole spectral width of 57 cm-1(HWHM) at small saturation. In a preliminary experiment, we have observed the modulation of a CW CO2laser beam by intense nanosecond pulses of a second CO2laser offset in frequency by up to 140 cm-1."
"The contemporary semiconductor laser oscillates and radiates power simultaneously in many of the characteristic modes of its cavity, perhaps only a few for the \"stripe\" laser neat threshold, but hundreds or thousands for power lasers. This article provides a comprehensive theory of the modal characteristics: field structure, polarization, characteristic frequency, radiation pattern, and losses. A new theory is developed for cavities with a nonuniform dielectric. The subject matter is indispensable to understanding or use of the new nonlinear theory of laser processes. Much of it is also relevant to dielectric, optical transmission systems in general"
"Laser action in lithium neodymium tetraphosphate, LiNdP4O12(LNP), crystals, pumped with AlxGa1-xAs electroluminescent diodes, is reported, citing both end- and side-pump configurations. The threshold incident light-emitting diode (LED) intensities at about -30°C are 14.9 W/cm2and 7.2 W/cm2for end and side pump, respectively. Temperature dependences of threshold, stimulated emission cross section, and round-trip loss were measured experimentally. Possibility of room-temperature CW operation, maximum output power, and optimum coupling are discussed. Taking account of improvements of pumping optics, crystal homogeneity and LED structure, LED intensities required for room-temperature CW operation are 35 W/cm2and 8.5 W/cm2for end and side pump, respectively."
"It is demonstrated that small values of small-signal gain and total internal losses in far-infrared lasers can, in principle, be determined by measuring the optimum and threshold output coupling coefficients with a Michelson coupler. Experimental results show that although accurate determination of the small-signal gain can be made, only a good approximation of the internal losses is obtained by this method. The gain of the 220-μm transition of H2O is shown to increase from 0.24 percent m-1to 0.43 percent m-1with the addition of helium to 0.25 tort H2O at a discharge current of 1.8 A."
"Precise absorption measurements on vibration-rotation transitions pumping far-infrared (FIR) laser transitions in HCOOH, CH3OH, CH3I and CH3F were carried out using a frequency-stabilized and intensity-controlled CO2laser. Linear absorption coefficients and saturation intensities as a function of pressure are obtained. With the help of a rate equation model it is concluded that within the pressure range relevant for CW FIR lasers the rate of deexcitation of pumped molecules is limited by rotational relaxation. For CH3F, limitation by diffusion of excited molecules to the cell wall is observed."
"Measurements of the electrical characteristics of double-heterostructure (DH) stripe-geometry AlGaAs junction lasers are reported. We show that the electrical characteristics of these lasers are adequately represented by a resistor in series with a p-n junction characterized by a classical diode equation,I = I_{s} [\\exp (q V_{j}/\\etakT) - 1]. Devices have been measured with almost ideal junction characteristics with both the saturation current, Is, and the exponential parameter, η, constant, while in other diodes both η and Isexhibit a strong current dependence. Measurement of the first derivativedV/dIand the productIdV/dIis shown to be an especially useful technique for electrical characterization, yielding accurate and direct determination of the series resistance, the exponential junction parameter, and the laser threshold current. The observation of lasing threshold from an electrical measurement, instead of from the more usual optical measurement, is discussed in terms of the saturation behavior of the junction voltage at and above threshold."
"Calculations using the rate equations for an ideal 4-level laser system show that there is a minimum frequency below which efficient repetitive cavity dumping of a laser will not be stable. Expressions for the field and inversion variables are derived. Experimental results have been obtained using a folded cavity Nd-YAG laser that is perturbed by an intracavity acoustooptic modulator. The observed field inside the cavity is shown to behave like a damped harmonic oscillator. The minimum repetitive frequency,f, of Stable operation is shown to increase with increased pumping rate and system loss and decrease with increasing laser cavity length. As a result, the minimum stable frequency depends on the strength of perturbation of the modulator since this adds loss to the system. The range of stable operation for the Nd-YAG laser under investigation varies from 135 kHz to several megahertz."
"A new technique for direct demodulation of a 10.6-μm FM signal using a Stark absorption cell is described. A Stark tunable absorption line in NH2D is used to track the time-varying frequency of the incoming FM laser signal using a closed servo loop. The demodulated FM signal is proportional to the feedback voltage applied to the Stark cell. Demodulation at frequencies up to 5 kHz has been demonstrated, the rate being limited only by the bandwidth of the available servo electronics."
"The effect of low electric field Stark tuning on the absorption of CH3OH gas at theP(12) 9.4-\\muCO2laser line has been studied. At the 220-mtorr CH3OH pressure optimal for CH3OH far-infrared (FIR) laser operation, the line center absorption coefficient increases by a factor of 5 with a Stark field of 2.3 kV/cm."

"After GaP red light-emitting diodes (LED's) had been degraded by the forward-biased operation, changes of the light output, the minority carrier lifetime, the photocurrent, and the photocapacitance were measured. There was a linear decreasing relation between the light output and the carrier lifetime. A center which was related to the degradation of the light output was observed by means of photocurrent and photocapacitance measurements. This center's energy level is about 0.8 eV from either the valence or conduction band. This center was observed to increase in concentration with degradation. However, the contribution of this center to the minority carrier lifetime is not established since the capture cross sections of the center are unknown and is not known whether the center occurs on the n-side, or the p-side, or on both sides. This center does not appear to be an oxygen donor."
"A simple model which can explain practically all important features of time delays in GaAs lasers is presented. It assumes only the presence of traps within the forbidden band and considers that the relative movement of quasi-Fermi levels of traps with temperature controls the population of the empty traps which act as saturable absorbers and thereby produce delays."
"We have measured the nonlinear optical susceptibility coefficient governing self-induced changes in the state of elliptical polarization of a monochromatic beam in 10 common solvents. These are the first such measurements at 1060 nm. We show how our results may be used to estimate self-focusing in these solvents and to clarify other non-linear optical properties."
"We have studied several types of flat-plate-transmission-line pulse-excited nitrogen lasers. Experiments were carried over a wide variety of parameters such as laser-tube pressure, charging voltage, laser-tube inductance, transmission-line impedance, and others. A theory of the nitrogen laser is presented which treats the laser as an integrated electrooptical system. The theory is based upon the known macroscopic properties of nitrogen discharges along with the known electron impact ionization and excitation cross sections for the N2molecule. The theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with the experimental observations. It is suggested that this type of theoretical approach should be applicable to fast high-power discharges in many other gases."
"A pulsed dye laser system with a narrow-band signal injected into the cavity is considered. The injection starts prior to the excitation pulse. It is shown that during a transient period, injection locking can be achieved for a much wider range of parameters than under conventional CW conditions. The analysis is based on a set of coupled rate equations for the population densities and photon fluxes at all wavelengths. These are solved numerically with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Analytical approximations, which are helpful for understanding the behavior of such systems, are presented. Both straight, two-mirror cavities, and ring laser cavities are discussed. The temporal evolution of the spectral components at all wavelengths is described. The range of tunability in this mode of operation and its dependence on various parameters, such as pulse length, cavity dimensions, and injection intensity are discussed."

"Kiselev [10] has solved the boundary equations for an asymmetric slab waveguide with a shallow sinusoidal corrugation, and derived explicit, closed expressions for the TE radiation loss coefficients of various waveguide geometries. For many practical applications in integrated optics, the Rayleigh assumption justifying the boundary-matching procedure and the approximations of linear perturbation analysis employed in this derivation are both satisfied. We have extended this procedure to TM modes and found that the expressions for both TE and TM modes in all of the geometries so treated agree identically with those derived by coupled-mode theory. The dependence of the TM radiation loss coefficient in each waveguide geometry on the grating period, radiation angle, refractive index profile, and mode polarization is illustrated graphically, and compared with its TE counterpart."
"A VUV lasing scheme employing charge-exchange between H+ ions and Cs atoms is discussed. An approximate set of rate equations is described and numerically solved to determine the conditions under which the threshold for laser action might be achieved. The requited density and sharpness of both the H+ and Cs pulses and the expected characteristics of the laser output under various initial conditions are determined from the solution of these equations."
"Investigation of the rate equations of a semiconductor laser suggests that bit rates of 3-4 Gbit/s can be achieved. Delay, ringing transients, and charge-storage effects can be removed by adjusting the dc-bias current and the peak and width of the current pulse to values prescribed by simple analytical expressions. Also, simple approximate formulas for the light pulse maximum, width, delay, and integrated values are given."

"The effects of gas additives on optical gain of the CO chemical laser (CL) have been measured for N2, SO2, H2, HF, CF4, CCl2F2, CO, OCS, N2O, and NO. One of the more unusual additives, NO, has been used to control the output spectrum of a laser oscillator by controlled sequential quenching of the high bands. The significance of these results for total power enhancement, output spectrum control, and alternate diluent use is discussed."
"A simple method for measuring the depth of modulation is described. This method, which requires only power measurements, is independent of the modulation frequency and has been shown to be accurate when compared to more conventional techniques."
"We show that seemingly symmetric longitudinal modes symmetrical distributed feedback (DFB) lasers utilizing higher orc Bragg reflection actually have differing thresholds and resonant wavelength shifts from the Bragg condition as a result of power radiated by the grating."
 "An improved technique for measuring zero power gain in a CW HF-DF chemical laser has been developed in which a CW HF(DF) single-line, frequency-stabilized TEM00mode probe laser is used. Through use of a flat rotating mirror and focusing elements, the streamwise distribution of zero-power gain was scanned at a rate of ∼1 mm/μs with a spatial resolution of ∼1 mm. The zero-power-gain profile was observed for two arc-driven chemical-laser nozzles with both HF and DF active species. The nozzles consisted of a 36-slit array with perforated tube H2injectors and a 55-slit array with uniform H2injection. Results are presented for the variation of zero power gain with axial distance, the magnitude and location of peak gain, and the gain cutoff location for a number of transitions. Peak gain values of 15 percent/cm and 5.5 percent/cm were measured with HF and DF active species, respectively, with the 55-slit nozzle array."
"The fraction of the electrical power which is placed into the vibrational energy mode of CO by a CW, aerodynamically stabilized, glow discharge has been found to decrease from 76 to 30 percent as the input energy increases from zero to 0.8 eV per CO molecule. The remaining energy is measured as being lost to gas heating within the discharge. In the first of the two experiments reported here, the vibrational energy was transferred into stream heating by collisions of the excited CO molecules with aluminum screening. The resulting heating was used to determine the energy in CO vibration. In the second experiment, the relative intensities of the spontaneous emission from the overtone bands of CO were used to determine the vibrational energy content of the CO. The results of the two measurements agreed well. The fraction of power entering vibration was found to depend on the energy loading per CO molecule, independent of He diluent concentration, total pressure, or nearness to the arcing limit. The maximum energy which can be stored in vibration for this self-sustained discharge was found to be approximately 0.25 eV/CO molecule."
"The effect of material absorption loss on grating-coupler performance is presented. In particular we examine grating couplers fabricated holographically in photoresist. It is shown that a total field decay constant αTmust be used in place of the leaky wave contant α whenever loss is appreciable. This total rate of field decay αTcan be obtained, to a good approximation, by adding an absorption loss factor αabsto the leaky wave constant α. The absorption rate αabsis calculated by considering a suitable equivalent uniform waveguide and the leaky wave constant α is obtained by neglecting all loss in the structure except that due to beam radiation. Guided wave attenuation is found to be due almost entirely to absorption in the residual resist layer left between the grating and the waveguide rather than to absorption in the grating teeth. Experiments demonstrate that grating couplers fabricated in Shipley AZ 1350B photoresist have measured properties in agreement with the lossy description described above."
"Results of an analysis of gain saturation in distributed feedback (DFB) lasers with end reflectors are presented. The dependence of the gain and frequency-shift eigenvalues of DFB lasers on the properties of end reflectors is reduced by gain-saturation effects. The degree of gain saturation is sensitive to the reflector properties if the distributed feedback and the reflections from the ends are of approximately equal strength."
"Sum-frequency generation experiments in which the second harmonics of rhodamine and coumarin dye lasers are upconverted to the 208-234 nm by mixing with 1064 nm are described. The dye lasers were pumped by the second and third harmonics of a repetitively pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Both temperature-tuned and angle-tuned phase matching techniques were used with mixer crystals of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Tunable light from 246 nm to 259 nm also was generated by mixing the output of a coumarin laser with the 532-nm harmonic of the Nd:YAG laser. Peak powers between about 500 W and 10 kW were obtained, and both theoretical and experimental tuning curves have been determined for these processes. Limitations imposed by mode beating effects in the Nd:YAG laser and by the relatively broad linewidth of the dye lasers are discussed."

"A potentially efficient, high-energy 16-μm source is proposed based on stimulated rotational Raman scattering in H2or D2using a TEA CO2laser source. The calculated pump energy threshold for rotational Raman scattering on theS(0) 354.33 cm-1Raman line of H2at 77 K and 1 atm pressure is 3.1 J."
 "The pressure and temperature dependent absorption and fluorescence spectra of the cesium-xenon (CsXe) molecule have been examined. In contrast to previous investigations of the alkali-rare gas molecules, cesium atomic states that have weakly allowed optical transitions have been studied and have been shown to form excimer levels that are attractive for application as potential dissociation lasers. In particular, the (Cs[7^{2}S]Xe)* excimer appears promising as a source of high-energy laser radiation due to 1) its large dissociation energy (0.132 eV), 2) its stimulated emission cross section of\\simeq10^{-17}cm2, and 3) its small population threshold inversion densities (\\simeq10^{13}cm-3)."
"Significant changes in the optical and electrical properties of stripe-geometry (AlGa)As double-heterostructure junction lasers have been observed to accompany a nonlinearity in the current dependence of the lasing emission. Over the nonlinear range, the optical field of the lasing emission shifts continuously with current toward one boundary of the active stripe. Simultaneously, effective gain saturation is lost and additional transverse modes are excited. The increasing gain is believed to occur primarily in spatial regions where the optical intensity is reduced as a result of the transverse motion of the field. Additional observations suggest that this transverse motion results from an interaction between the intense lasing field and the active medium. Consequently, gain depletion is discussed as a possible cause for the transverse instability. Implications of this model for a qualitative understanding of the improved output performance recently obtained from lasers with narrow stripes are also considered."
"The influence of the longitudinal plasma wave on propagation characteristics of a metal-clad-dielectric-slab waveguide is discussed theoretically: the influences on propagating TM waves and on a surface plasma wave, respectively, appear at a wavelength shorter and longer than the plasma wavelength of the metal cladding."
"Continuous arc-assisted electric discharges have been obtained in CO-Ar and CO-N2-Ar gas mixtures at pressures of about 0.1 atm and with maximum discharge loadings of 7.9 and 23 kW/ mole/s, respectively. The discharge technique appears suitable for adaptation to CW, high-power CO lasers."

"A cylindrical discharge scheme which utilizes a fine wire as the central electrode is investigated for compact CO2TEA laser applications. It is found that the strong radial dependence of electrical energy deposition into the plasma, a consequence of the large ratio of outer to inner electrode radii, produces a radial gain profile which is well localized in the center of the discharge tube. This allows for efficient matching of low-order stable optical modes to the active gain region while providing a high degree of mode selectivity in favor of these modes. Oscillation in the TEM01Laguerre-Gaussian mode has been obtained at electrical efficiencies approaching 4 percent."
"The injection of a master oscillator signal in a high-power TEA-CO2laser is analyzed and a dynamic model is formulated to represent the interaction. Based on the competition between the injected signal and the spontaneous emission, the model describes the transient evolution of the different field amplitudes and phases together with their effect on the inversion. A study over a wide range of injection levels and detuning frequencies clearly indicates three distinct regions of operation: a spontaneous oscillation zone, a mode-selection zone, and a frequency-locking zone. The main predictions of the model are compared with the results obtained with an experimental injection apparatus that assures adequate control of the TEA laser cavity length and that provides means for measuring the frequency of the output pulse. While the first two zones are directly observed, it is experimentally established that, at injection levels up to 5 W/cm2, the frequency-locking zone does not exceed, as predicted, the 3-MHz resolution limit of the apparatus."
"This paper describes an optical waveguide isolator that utilizes the unidirectional guided-radiation mode coupling in a magnetooptic/anisotropic slab guide. The basic structure is the semileaky-type waveguide that has been previously used as a polarization mode filter. Specific features of the proposed device are its compact one-section form resulting from the inherent polarization-discrimination property and the relaxed dimensional tolerance due to the automatic phase-matching of coupled modes. Design data and a related discussion are given for the example of LiNbO3/YIG/GGG layered structure operating in the 1.15-μm-wavelength region."
"A variational method is used to calculate dispersion curves for channel waveguides fabricated by masked diffusion. Composition profiles for the waveguides are obtained by numerical solution of the diffusion equation, assuming that the diffusant concentration in the unmasked region of the substrate surface is constant during the diffusion process. A linear dependence of refractive index change on diffusant concentration is assumed. The dependence of the number of guided modes on mask gap width and diffusion depth is determined as an aid to the design of modulators and switches for integrated optics."
"We have observed seven infrared laser transitions when exciting a He discharge in a silver hollow cathode. To our knowledge, five of the seven laser transitions have not been reported previously in the literature."
"A pulsed electric field is used to fine tune the phase-matching conditions in temperature-tuned CD*A for second-harmonic generation (SHG) to 0.53 μ from a 1.06-μ laser. By changing the pulse-width of theEfield, the clamped and unclamped electrooptic (EO) effects are studied, resulting in the determination ofr_{63} = 14.1 \\pm 0.4 \\times 10^{-10}cm/V (electrooptic constant) and the productP_{66}d_{36} = 10.2 \\pm 0.4 \\times 10^{-10}cm/V (elastooptic and piezoelectric constants, respectively) at 102°C. A steady 57-percent efficient SHG was obtained for 10.4 W of 1.06 μ laser light in CDA. The usual instability caused by self-heating was eliminated electrooptically."
"Laser machining is the basis of a new technique for manufacturing integrated RC networks. The technique involves the generation of resistance patterns by laser machining nonconductive paths in capacitor plates composed of polyester film metallized with 400 Å of zinc. The reliability of such networks under operating conditions is largely dependent upon the electrical isolation provided by the laser-machined line. Good adherence of the metal film at the edges of the machined line is required, with no loose metal particles. This entails careful control of the laser pulse intensity and spot overlap. A further restriction on the laser-machining parameters is imposed by the fact that the 6-μm-thick polyester film (the dielectric body of the network) should not be thermally damaged due to evaporating metal film. In this paper we discuss the laser-machining aspects and the electrical characteristics of the laser-generated networks."
"A welding method has been developed that makes use of fundamental mode laser pulses. These pulses show single-mode relaxation oscillations with a high peak power first spike causing breakdown of the material surface. The laser emission following the first spike can be adapted to the welding requirements and the material properties. Metallurgical problems of intermixing of dissimilar materials in the weld puddle have been investigated with an electron beam microprobe analysis. In the case of materials which normally show bad weldability uniform welds with maximum strength could be achieved by local addition of welding agents to the weld puddle. The lap weld of a stainless-steel spring with a nickel-iron baseplate has been performed with Nb as welding agent."
"A system description and first results of the Asterix III high-power iodine laser built at IPP Garching are given. This laser is designed to yield an output energy of 1 kJ in about 1 ns. Until now pulses with output energies up to 300 J and pulse lengths ranging from 1 to 3 ns have been obtained."
"An ADP parametric amplifier pumped by the 266-nm fourth harmonic ofQ-switched or mode-locked Nd lasers has been used to produce nanosecond or picosecond pulses at a number of wavelengths across the visible spectrum. The input signal to the parametric amplifier was obtained either from pulsed parametric fluorescence passed through a Fabry-Perot (FP) filter, or from CW noble gas lasers. Peak powers to 60 kW and pulse lengths of the order of 10 ps have been generated by amplifying the beam from a CW He-Ne laser."
"A high-pressure high-repetition-rate pulsed-discharge technique is described. Ultraviolet preionization and voltage switching are integrated using spark-gap switches in a geometry such that they will irradiate the discharge gas. A repetition rate of 4000 pulses per second (pps) has been achieved."
 "The photodegradation mechanisms in xanthene dye-laser solutions are investigated at 77 K by the direct detection of a decrease in the concentration of dye molecules in the lowest excited triplet state (T1state) and of free radicals produced after degradation using an ESR technique under UV (3511 + 3638 Å) or 5145-Å laser irradiations. It is shown that the ESR spectral shape of the radicals induced by an UV laser beam is quite different from that of those induced by a 5145-Å beam. For those radicals, the irradiation time and power dependences, the effects of dye and solvent molecular structures and the role of the T1state by the addition of cyclooctatetraene (COT) quenchers are examined in some detail. As a result the two following laser-induced photochemical reactions are proposed: in UV laser- or flashlamp-pumped dye lasers, the C-H bond rupture of a solvent molecule due to the energy transfer of a dye molecule in a higher excited triplet state, which is produced by aT-Tabsorption of a dye molecule in the T1state, results in a radical and a leuco compound of the dye. On the other hand, in the case of the 5145-Å laser excitation, a partially reversible change of a dye molecule in the T1state produced by only a one-photon absorption results in another radical which depends on the chromophoric structure of the dye."
"A cryostat specifically designed for maintaining nonlinear optical crystals at temperatures between room temperature and -175°C is described. The sample is held in a vacuum environment, and its temperature is kept within 0.1°C of the desired value by applying regulated power to a sample holder which is connected to a liquid-nitrogen-cooled heat sink through a thermal resistance. The system is easily constructed and can be evacuated with a mechanical pump. It can operate longer than 6 h on a single filling of liquid nitrogen with the pump disconnected."
"The threshold for pulsed 10.6 μm laser-induced surface and bulk damage in transparent materials has been shown to depend on the manner in which the samples are irradiated. When a site is irradiated several times, starting at a very low intensity and increasing the flux a few percent on successive shots until damage occurs, the threshold is often higher than if each site were irradiated only once. In addition, it has been shown that the damage threshold also depends on the sample tested and so the use of relative damage-threshold measurements to identify the damage mechanism should be reexamined."
"A theoretical and experimental study is made of the grating couplers for thin-film waveguides. It is shown that the perturbation series expansion of the field based upon the Green's function approach can actually be summed to all orders to give an expression for the efficiency of grating couplers of arbitrary thickness. The results obtained by this theory are in good agreement with the experimental results obtained. It is also shown that the grating coupling efficiency depends strongly on the grating profile."

"Systematic studies of spectral intensities using the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory for crystal-field-induced electric-dipole transitions demonstrate that Nd-doped glasses can be tailored for specific laser applications by proper selection of the glass constituents. Variations with glass composition are reported for the following properties: induced-emission cross section, peak fluorescence wavelength, effective fluorescence bandwidth, radiative lifetime, transition probabilities, and fluorescence branching ratios. Both glass network formers and network-modifier ions were changed. In these studies the induced-emission cross section for the Nd3+,4F_{3/2} \\rightarrow4I_{11/2}laser transition was varied by more than a factor of 4 by changing the glass host."
"The electron distribution function has been calculated for simulated conditions of SF6-N2 gas mixtures under conditions typical of a N2 electrical discharge laser. The results indicate that the electron distribution function, transport quantities, and electronic excitation rates change only a few percent in the presence of SF6 provided E/N is unchanged. The enhancement in laser power output with the addition of SF6 is attributed to an increased operating value of E/N in the electrical discharge."
"The lasing efficiencies and photochemical stabilities of laser dyes useful in the 710-1080-nm spectral region have been investigated using aQ-switched ruby laser pumping source. The measured bleaching ratesPdefined as the probability of irreversible decomposition of a dye molecule per absorbed photon, varied from\\leq 1 \\times 10^{-5}to3 \\times 10^{-4}for the different dye-solvent combinations investigated. Broad-band lasing efficiencies (the ratios of dye laser output to ruby radiation input) ranged from 4 to 43 percent. Shifts of wavelength tuning range with variations in solvent, dye concentration, and dye laser cavity geometry are reported."
"The high-repetition-rate pulsed-YAG-laser welding of insulated copper wires to terminal posts and their real-time evaluation with stress-wave emission (SWE) are discussed. It is shown that to minimize damage to the wire from the incident radiation a shoulder terminal, wherein the shoulder covers the wire, is desirable. The experimental and the analytical results show that for the geometry a terminal made out of higher melting-point material than copper is desirable. SWE techniques have been used to predict the quality of a laser weld in real time. An experimental criterion has been established for such a prediction. This criterion has been verified by resistance measurement, visual observation, and, to a limited extent, mechanical-pull testing. It is shown that an almost linear relation exists between the threshold crossings of an SWE signal and the quality of the weld."
 "Measurements of the decrease in reflectivity of metallic surfaces as a function of time during irradiation by pulses from a CO2- TEA laser are described. The TEA laser delivered power densities up to3 \\times 10^{8}W/cm2in a 100-ns-duration pulse. The reflectivity was monitored as a function of time by a probing beam from a low-power continuous CO2laser operating at 9.6 μm, and focused onto the same area struck by the TEA laser pulse. This paper presents data on the decrease in specular reflectivity as a function of time under various conditions of laser power density, laser pulse duration, ambient air pressure, and cumulative number of pulses on the same area."

Results for GaAs:GaAlAs double-heterostructure lasers with rectangular, triangular, and sawtooth-shaped teeth, various Bragg diffraction orders, and transverse mode numbers are presented for TM modes and compared with those for TE modes. Generally, but not always, coupling coefficients for TE modes exceed those for TM modes."

"Experimental studies are described wherein an atomic beam of uranium vapor produced by electron-beam evaporation is selectively excited and ionized by light from two short-pulse narrow-bandwidth, tuned dye lasers, and detected and analyzed by a mass spectrometer. The total number of ions per pulse produced is small; however, the time of production is known precisely. By counting single ions, using digital logic, and multiplexing the mass spectrometer between U238and U235, it is possible to measure isotope ratios as a function of exciter wavelength and to correct for background effects and spurious ions. These results demonstrated 50 percent enrichment of U235/U238. Excited-state lifetimes were measured by observing yields as a function of the delay between the two laser pulses. In addition, for an excitation wavelength of 4266.325 Å, the variation of two-step photoionization efficiency was measured as a function of the wavelength of the ionizing laser. The maximum yield at an ionizing wavelength of 3609 Å corresponds to a cross section of2 \\times 10^{-17}cm2for matched linewidths. Also the ionization potential of uranium was determined to be 6.187 ± 0.002 eV."
"CW passive mode locking of a homogeneously broadened laser is considered. In the coordinate plane, whose abscissa is proportional to the small-signal saturable absorber loading, and whose ordinate is proportional to the small-signal gain, the following regimes are laid out: 1) steady-state single-pulse mode-locking solutions; 2) stability against relaxation oscillations; 3) self-starting of mode locking. The assumption is made that CW mode locking can be obtained only for a choice of parameters for which all three regimes overlap. We require further that the overlap regime be reached by a monotonic increase of small-signal gain (pumping), without passing outside regime 2). Under these conditions one may state requirements on the system parameters for the obtainment of single-pulse mode locking by a saturable absorber. The analysis explains why it has been impossible to mode lock passively the CW Nd:YAG laser, but passive mode locking of the CW dye-laser system is possible."
"This paper investigates some of the properties of continuous wave (CW) (AlGa)As-GaAs injection lasers with Al in the active region. The active region gain at thresholdgth is estimated as a function of Al concentration in the active region. The basic configuration is a five-layer structure with GaAs as the two outer regions; the center region is AlyGa1-yAs and the two surrounding layers are AlxGa1-xAs ."
"Frequency multiplication of intense laser pulses in narrow acceptance angle crystals is commonly accomplished with large conversion efficiency. However, the conversion efficiency can be seriously affected by degradation of the laser pulse, such as occurs when small-scale intensity fluctuations exponentiate due to nonlinear refractive effects within the laser. We present evidence that beam breakup such as this can cause a significant fraction of the laser energy to lie outside the acceptance angle of the crystal, thus diminishing conversion efficiency."
"The design and performance of a self-heated metal-vapor laser utilizing copper, gold, and copper plus gold as active laser materials are described. A total average power of 17 mW at a pulse-repetition rate of 1.7 kHz was obtained simultaneously at 5106 Å (green), 5782 Å (yellow), and 6278 Å (red). The purpose of the research reported here was to obtain multiple-wavelength laser operation by mixing, in a single laser tube, metals known to lase individually. The design and operating characteristics of a discharge-heated metal-vapor laser utilizing copper, gold, or a mixture of copper and gold as the active laser materials are described. Although gold has been used as the active laser material previously, we believe this is the first report of a self-sustained (the only source of heat to vaporize the metal is the discharge used to excite it) gold-vapor laser and the first report of a multiple-metal-vapor laser."
"Practical rates of direct pulse modulation of semiconductor lasers have so far been limited to below several hundred megahertz, owing to serious distortion in the output signal caused by the relaxation oscillation of the light intensity. Based on theoretical analysis of the dynamic properties of lasing under constant injection of external radiation into the cavity modes, light injection is proposed as a method for suppressing the relaxation oscillation. The effectiveness of this method has been confirmed in a series of preliminary experiments which employed GaAs injection lasers both as the modulated laser and as the external source of the injected radiation."
"The output power of a single-mode CW dye ring laser can be enhanced by 50 percent by changing over from standing-wave (SW) operation to traveling-wave (TW) operation. This effect is attributed to smoothing out the SW pattern in the active medium, which gives rise to spatial inhomogeneities of the inversion."
"Double-heterostructure (DH) diode lasers with a thin Ga1-xAlxAs layer between the active GaAs region and the GaAs substrate or superstrate are analyzed. In these devices power flows through the thin Ga1-xAlxAs layer and is radiated into the substrate or superstrate. Three methods for computing the laser thresholds are developed and compared. The first is an analytic perturbation technique, which yields accurate results in many cases of practical interest. The second and third are rapidly convergent numerical iteration techniques. The former utilizes overlap integrals to compute absorption losses and thresholds; the latter includes all losses and gains directly in the formulation. We show that conventional DH diode lasers can be designed with thick active GaAs layers and still achieve lowest order TE-mode operation. These devices will produce better collimated, higher power output beams than do similar devices with thinner active regions. Transverse-mode control is achieved because all higher order modes have increased penetration through the thin Ga1-xAlxAs , and therefore exhibit inereased radiation losses into the substrate or superstrate. A design example is included in which it is shown that with proper choice of the Ga1-xAlxAs-layer thickness the TE0-mode threshold increases by 5 percent compared with a 110-percent increase in the TE1threshold. These results are virtually independent of the substrate power-absorption coefficient. Threshold current densities are computed for a set of diodes studied experimentally by Casey and Panish and the results are shown to be in excellent agreement."

Consideration of the design criteria established guarantees about one million light pulses with more than 1 MW from simple high-efficiency construction."
"A pulsed CO2-pumped external cavity spin-flip laser has been operated with the output frequency governed to a large extent by the Fabry-Perot (FP) modes of resonant output couplers. An output spectral width of 0.027 ± 0.003 cm-1has been attained."
"A computer solution is presented for the nitrogen laser excited by a longitudinal relativistic electron beam. The solution demonstrates efficient extraction by amplified spontaneous emission, and preferential radiation parallel to the electron beam, caused by the traveling-wave nature of excitation. These observations tend to validate approximations used to calculate extraction in an earlier study."
"Using quasi-CW sinusoidally modulated excitation from a 0.8-μm-wavelength laser diode, we have obtained driven spiking oscillations in miniature, high-Nd-concentration room-temperature lasers of NdP5O14, and NdAl3(BO3)4. With modulation indices of 0.25 or less, peak-power enhancements of 11 (at 35 kHz) and 7 (at 124 kHz), respectively, have been observed for these materials. Theoretical calculations of these and other characteristics of the driven oscillations are in good agreement with experiment."
"Using a simple rate equation approach we examine the gas kinetic and discharge properties of waveguide CO2lasers. We calculate the dependence of the population inversion and laser small-signal gain on gas pressure, gas mixture, pumping rate (discharge current), tube bore diameter, and wall temperature. The results indicate, for example, that at a pressure of 50 torr and a tube-bore diameter of 0.125 cm, the gain is optimized with a gas mixture in the ratio CO2:N2:He of 1:0.75: 1.5. At higher pressures the gain is optimized by using more helium-rich mixtures. We also calculate the dependence of laser tunability on the gas kinetic properties and cavity losses. We find that for low-loss cavities the laser tunability may substantially exceed the molecular full width at half-maximum. Furthermore, the more helium-rich gas mixtures give greater tunability when cavity losses are small, and less tunability when cavity losses are large. The roles of the various gases in the waveguide CO2laser are the same as those in conventional devices. By contrast with conventional lasers, however, the waveguide laser transition is homogeneously broadened. Thus the dependence of gain on gas pressure and other kinetic properties differs substantially from that predicted by scaling results from conventional low-pressure lasers."

"Oscillator strengths of Nd3+in NdxLa1-xP5O14for0.01 \\leq x \\leq 1are shown to be constant. Consequently, through the whole concentration range Nd3+behaves essentially as one center with respect to transition probabilities. This situation is discussed in relation to concentration quenching."
"Gain has been measured in high-density (∼ 0.5 amagat) CO gas, which was cooled to 77 K and excited with an intense burst of fission fragments induced by a fast-burst reactor (Sandia SPR II). Peak-gain coefficients\\lsim 0.5percent/cm were measured in pure CO over the wavelength range5.1-5.33 \\mu, for fission-fragment energy depositions ∼ 200 J/l. Interpreting the measured gains with an approximate steady-state vibrational distribution implies that\\sim 25-70percent of the fission-fragment energy deposited in the CO is appearing as excitation of the vibrational modes of the CO molecule."
"Theoretical calculations of threshold intensity and output frequency, as functions of magnetic field, are presented for the InSb spin-flip Raman laser (SFRL). These are based on a numerical solution of Maxwell's equations for the case of a pump beam of Gaussian profile, and various analytical results for more approximate models. The results are used to discuss nonlinear tuning characteristics, mode jumping, and the dependence of threshold power upon beam size. These are the first calculations to include the effects of finite beam size, which are found to be quite significant and consist chiefly of a marked asymmetry of the variation of threshold power and tuning rate across each mode. This asymmetry is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations. The model may be readily generalized to include higher modes and extended to the case of constant input power."
"In contrast with the normally accepted concepts in the construction of transversely excited atmospheric (TEA) CO2lasers it is found that homogeneously roughened electrodes perform better then polished ones."
"A strip-loaded diffused optical waveguide consists of a one-dimensional diffused guide with a narrow loading strip of dielectric deposited on the surface. Two-dimensional modes can exist in the diffused material, confined in depth by the diffusion and in width by the loading strip. The propagation constants of these two-dimensional modes are calculated. The requirements for the index of refraction and width of the loading strip are discussed along with the rate of decay of electric-field amplitude away from the strip. A numerical example typical of Ti-diffused LiNbO3is given."
 "It is shown theoretically that in lasers with box modes and polarization determined by facet reflectivity, the axis of polarization rotates with viewing direction. For thin double-heterojunction (DHJ) cavities, the angle ρ between the junction plane and theEfield of the radiation depends on the angles θ and φ in the junction plane and transverse to it,\\rho \\approx 10^{-2}\\theta\\phiin degrees. It is suggested that this behavior is a useful test for control of polarization by facet reflection. Measurements show the relation is followed in wide sawed lasers with good box modes prepared from a thin DHJ wafer and in a narrow stripe laser from the same wafer. A second narrow stripe laser from the wafer and a single-heterojunction (SHJ) cavity have no such dependence. Qualitative discussion of the measurements reveals information about polarization and mode properties not previously available."

The optimization of the frequency-doubled laser is greatly aided by use of the computer program.

"The output coupling of an idealized, symmetric model of a double-heterostructure (DH) laser is analyzed theoretically using parameters suitable to Pb1-xSnxTe. For the TEOmode incident at the laser mirror and for thin optical guiding regions such that only the TEO, TE1, TMO, and TM1modes may propagate, an exact formulation of the coupling problem is obtained including mode coupling at the mirror into the continuum of unguided radiation modes. Using this formulation, the power reflection and transmission coefficients, the fraction of incident power coupled into the radiation modes, the mirror illumination, and the far-field pattern are calculated for typical parameters. Significant mode coupling can occur, limiting the maximum external efficiency of such lasers. This and other potentially undesirable characteristics resulting from close optical confinement, such as large output beam divergence, must be considered in design criteria for DH structures in this alloy system."
"With the use of velocity-dependent kinetic equations to account properly for collisional relaxation behavior in molecular lasers, new results for gain saturation formulas have been obtained for intermediate values of pressure. These results, for a traveling-wave field, are exact and, in proper limits, reduce to known results. Further, a more complete description of the behavior of the Lamb dip as a function of molecular parameters has been obtained, and it is shown how the Lamb dip depends not only upon molecular parameters, but upon the total cavity loss parameter itself."

Experimentally, it is found that in a regime where more than 20 percent of the electron-beam energy incident on the gas is converted to VUV fluorescence, the maximum incremental efficiency due to the addition of a sustainer discharge is about 7 percent. A kinetic model is described which attributes the low sustainer efficiencies to electron interactions with the excited state populations."
"A Pb0.96Sn0.04Se laser diode emitting in the 815-835- cm-1region with current tuning has been examined with applied magnetic fields at 7 kG and below. With increasing magnetic field the laser gain curve broadens, allowing more laser cavity modes (separated by 1.8 cm-1) to oscillate at a given current, and yielding a larger tuning range with current for each cavity mode.

"The advantages and disadvantages of the atomic iodine photodissociation laser for high-energy operation have been considered. Laser excitation by both slow and fast flashlamps has been investigated; in slow flash excitation, self-mode-locking occurs frequently and the output-mode characteristics of the laser operated in this way have been studied. The comparative performance of different parent materials for photodissociation has been investigated in the fast flash mode of excitation. This mode of excitation gives higher energy laser output and efficiency and less pyrolysis of the parent material. These observations, and the photolytic reversibility characteristics of different materials in repetitively photolyzed operation, have been discussed in the light of the most recently available kinetic data; i-C3F7I is the material of choice for laser operation. Finally, limits to the ability of atomic iodine photodissociation laser/amplifier(s) systems to generate and amplify short duration, high-energy pulses set by intralevel relaxation effects and coherent interactions are discussed."

"The effect of trapped radiation on the stimulated emission threshold and power in injection lasers is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The density of trapped radiation is determined by the relation between the gain and the loss coefficients for this radiation in the active region. The last value depends upon treatment of the cavity sidewalls and laser diode geometry. The absorption of spontaneous emission in the active diode region provides for an additional optical excitation of the crystal and can result in a decrease of threshold current. The GaAs laser diodes with Fabry-Perot cavities and four-ended resonators were studied. The lasing threshold for the axial modes is increased with the diode width and that for the nonaxial radiating modes is decreased with it. The luminescence spectra from the cavity ends and sidewalls are investigated as a function of diode length and current density. It is shown that the gained luminescence can be an essential source of energy losses in injection lasers and leads to limitations of dimensions of laser diodes with planar p-n-junctions. Various methods for suppression of harmful radiation and for increase of the stimulated emission power in injection lasers are discussed."
"Various hydrocarbons have been reacted with active nitrogen in a supersonic flow system. The resulting chemiluminescence was invariably dominated by CNA^{2} \\PiandB^{2} \\Sigma+ \\rightarrow X^{2}\\Sigma+emission. The intensity of this emission and the excited-state vibrational temperatures were strongly dependent upon the reactant hydrocarbon. Photon yields as high as 18.5 percent were measured for CNA^{2} \\Pi \\rightarrow X^{2}\\Sigma+emission when C2F4was used as a reactant, which makes this system a very promising chemically pumped laser candidate. Calculations have shown that if the populations in the electronically excited states can be vibrationally cooled, it should be possible to achieve positive gain in the system."

"The waveguiding properties of the slab-coupled waveguides (i.e., the optical stripline and the rib waveguide) are investigated by the vector variational method. The slab-coupled waveguides are low-loss optical waveguides which are easy to fabricate and design. In this paper, the propagation constants and the field intensity distributions of the slab-coupled waveguides are presented, and the effects on the wave-guiding properties caused by changing their geometrical parameters are discussed. The results obtained by employing the variational method are compared with those obtained by using other methods."
"In a high-power laser system both the nonlinear growth of small-scale spatial irregularities on a pulse (beam breakup) and the accumulation of self-induced phase-front distortion on the spatial envelope of the pulse (whole-beam self-focusing) alter the focusing properties of the system output. We present experimental results which show simultaneously and in detail the influence of these two effects on the spatial and temporal profiles of the focused output of a simple system. in an extreme case the focused on-axis intensity is observed to be reduced by beam breakup to 20 percent of the value obtained in the absence of breakup. Diffraction code calculations of whole-beam self-focusing, which in these experiments tends to enhance the focused on-axis intensity, are found to agree closely with the measured results and demonstrate that whole-beam self-focusing effects depend strongly on the plane being observed."
"Grating-coupled radiation in GaAs:GaAlAs lasers and waveguides is analyzed. A general formulation is developed for arbitrary-shaped gratings which need not be small in size. Two methods are used to solve the resulting equations in the case of rectangular-shaped gratings. The first is a perturbation technique and the second is iterative in nature. The iterative procedure converges to a numerical exact solution in many cases of practical interest and indicates that the perturbation results are quite accurate. Curves are presented for radiated power from traveling waves as a function of grating tooth height, tooth width, refractive index, waveguide thickness, and period for rectangular gratings in heterostructure waveguiding geometries. It is shown that radiation is not a monotonically increasing function of tooth height, but rather maxima occur when the teeth are half the optical wavelength in the material. Also, in particular geometries with an air:GaAs grating interface, radiated power of a mode can exceed 100 cm-1."

"Grating-coupled radiation in lasers and waveguides is analyzed for trapezoidal-shaped grating teeth which includes all triangular shapes. A perturbation technique is used which involves calculating the modes in a geometry with an inhomogeneous refractive index profile in the grating region. Curves are presented for radiated power from traveling waves as a function of blazing angle, grating tooth height, refractive index, and grating period. It is shown that the ratio of power radiated into the outer media depends greatly on tooth shape and size. By judiciously selecting parameters this ratio can exceed 50:1."
"Power output and beam noise parametric results are obtained for the blue transition of the self-heated He-Cd laser in tubes of 0.10-0.16-cm bore diameter. Presentation of this data in the form of performance contour maps shows that the usual scaling laws for laser discharges are accurate for this laser (<12-percent parameter variation for a 60-percent diameter variation) and is a convenient form for use in tube design. The contour maps imply the existence of a direct connection between the output and noise of this laser. A theory is proposed that the noise in the He-Cd discharge arises from the rapid increase in ionization rate due to Penning collisions as Cd is added to the He discharge. This produces a high gain in the discharge column for the growth of striation waves (which modulate the output). The theory correctly predicts the details of the laser noise behavior, showing that both the noise and output share a common origin in the Penning effect. The dependence of Cd vapor density on tube current is found, from sidelight studies, to be more pronounced in self-heated tubes (as opposed to tubes with externally heated Cd sources). A threshold dissipation value is given for puncture of the hot glass bore by the discharge (this is a common failure mode in the He-Cd laser)."
"A numerical analysis of rotational nonequilibrium effects in CW DF chemical lasers is presented. The rotational master equations incorporate the effects of simultaneous mixing, chemical pumping, rotational cross relaxation, and radiative emission. Rotational cross relaxation is described by \"exponential gap\" models in which ΔJ is unrestricted. Results of this analysis indicate that rotational equilibrium can be a poor assumption for high J levels even under small-signal conditions. The model predictions are in good qualitative agreement with observed multiline resonator spectra. Performance loss due to rotational nonequilibrium is predicted to be modest (∼15 percent) for multiline operation, with larger losses predicted for line-selected modes. Criteria for efficient line-selected operation are presented."

"This paper presents a theoretical study of fifth-harmonic generation (FHG) in an isotropic media. Two schemes are discussed-cascade generation in which the fifth harmonic results from successive nonlinear interactions in two separate elements, and direct generation where the fifth harmonic is produced in an isotropic media with third-and fifth-order nonlinear susceptibilities. In the plane-wave approximation almost full conversion of the pumping energy into the fifth harmonic is found to be possible. FHG with a focused Gaussian beam is also investigated. To determine the optimum conditions for FHG in the cascade scheme, the theory of four-wave mixing of light beams with arbitrary confocal parameters and waist locations is developed. In media with third- and fifth-order nonlinearity, the fifth harmonic results from step and direct processes. The interference between these two processes is discussed. Numerical calculations are presented for metal vapor-gas mixtures and Nd:glass laser pumping radiation."

"In a distributed feedback (DFB) laser with spatial index modulation, an antisymmetric taper of the feedback parameter,k, removes the threshold degeneracy, which is characteristic of uniform structures, and leads to one mode of particularly low threshold. Exact solutions are presented for the special case of an antisymmetric step ofk. An approximate perturbation method is developed which gives simple expressions for the threshold gains, and externalQ's of some tapered distributed feedback structures. The method is tested against two exact solutions, the uniform, and the stepped-kDFB laser. It is shown that the threshold of the stepped-kDFB laser is the lowest of any structure with an antisymmetric taper and a prescribed maximum value of|k|."

 "The single amplifier biquad (SAB) circuit of J. J. Friend is critically examined with a view to minimize its sensitivity properties. This is shown to involve the proper choice of the free design parameters to achieve a trade off between the contributions due to passive and active element variations. First the bandpass configuration is analyzed. A statistical measure of the overall pole variation due to both passive and active components is formulated. The analysis includes a novel but very simple approach for estimating the effects due to op amp variations which is applicable to many of the active filter topologies known. Using the figure of merit obtained in this fashion, it is shown that a near optimal design exists which permits ready physical realization, and which has the property that the transmission error terms are dominated by the irreducible fixed contribution due to theRCproduct which defines the resonant frequency. From the aspect of sensitivity, therefore, it is concluded that no other circuit topology can have superior performance. The frequency range over which these conclusions remain valid are determined by using reasonable estimates of circuit component tolerances. For a simple operational amplifier of the 741-type this range is shown to extend to approximately 2 kHz, while if a more sophisticated two-pole single zero compensation is used for the operational amplifier the range of validity is extended to about 20 kHz. The above results are then shown to hold for all the other important"
"A theory is developed for spectral transformations for two-dimensional digital filters. It is proved that these transformations take the form of stable two-dimensional all-pass functions and that the result of spectral transformation is stable if the original transfer function is stable. Emphasis is placed on formulating the transformations in a way which makes them easy to use for design, and it is shown that twodimensional spectral transformations offer a means of quickly obtaining new designs from previous ones. Included is a discussion of applications such as the design and realization of two-dimensional digital filters with tunable characteristics."

The controller andRCnetwork are effectively matched thereby eliminating the need for high-impedance buffer amplifiers."
"A proposed method for testing printed circuit boards for the existence of possible (undesired) short circuits transforms the test minimization problem into one of finding minimum vertex colorings of certain special graphs, called line-of-sight graphs. Under certain assumptions on the possible types of short circuits, we analyze the structure of such graphs and show that a well known and efficient algorithm can be used to color them with a small number of colors. In particular, we show that no more than 5, 8, or 12 colors (depending on the particular assumptions) will ever be required for such a graph, independent of the number of vertices. Thus, in such cases, the potential advantage of the proposed method over exhaustive testing could be considerable."
"The noise characterization of linear circuits is discussed in connection with the transformation of the noise parameters. The noise performance of two-ports is treated, as are methods for linear devices including correlated, uncorrelated, and partially correlated noise sources. Finally, the experimental determination of the noise parameters is described. Special attention is given to negative source resistances. It is shown that the noise performance of any linear two-port network can be completely characterized by 12 parameters; four noise and four complex network parameters."
"The solution of electric network problems by various algorithms such as for example Newton's method is often hampered by the presence of physical diodes with steeply rising exponential characteristics which cause overflow and slow convergence during numerical computation. In this paper we propose and analyze an algorithm which bypasses these difficulties by successively approximating the steep diode characteristics by smoother exponential functions. The algorithm may be modified to be used in the presence of ideal diodes and is related to penalty and multiplier methods for constrained minimization and Davidenko's method for solving certain ill-conditioned systems of nonlinear equations."
"In a recent paper by Oppenheim, Mecklenbrauker, and Mersereau [1] a class of variable cutoff linear phase digital filters has been proposed. The implementation of this class of filters is achieved by replacing a subnetwork in a prototype network such that it performs a frequency mapping of the prototype filter response. By varying a small number of coefficients in the subnetwork the frequency transformation can be varied. In this letter we examine the characteristics of this transformation in greater detail and discuss the range of parameters over which it can be useful."
"A method of synthesizing recursive digital filters with pre- where scribed attenuation and group-delay characteristics is presented. The method depends on the fact that the introduction of complex transmission zeros into the transfer function of the filter network allows independent control of both attenuation and group-delay responses of the filter. An example is presented which clearly demonstrates the improvement in attenuation response obtained when complex transmission zeros are introduced into the transfer function of the filter."
"The ASTAP-compatible circuit optimization program (AOP) is employed to minimize the access time of a read-only store memory circuit. The design of this circuit provides an example particularly wellsuited to the application of circuit optimization techniques. The design involves finding the optimal values for three design variables. The design objective can be expressed with one simple optimize parameter."
  "The pole of the operational amplifier is utilized to design second-order active filters. The design leads to two amplifier resistive structures. These filters have low sensitivities to active and passive elements and are tunable over a wide range of frequencies for medium and highQ. The independent control of\\omega_{0}, Q,andG_{o}is an added feature of the circuit. The structure realizes low-pass and bandpass functions simultaneously. The proposed structure realizes the specified\\omega_{0}andQwith lower resistance ratios. Good correlation has been observed between predicted and experimental results conducted at room temperature."
"The application of algebraic invariants of linear multivaluen-ports is Investigated for the optimization of linear(2m + n)-ports transmission networks. As a concrete example the restrictions on the scattering matrix of a linear passive embedding are determined for optimum performance as a phase or amplitude modulator. A sensitivity invariant is presented, which leads to a relation between differential sensitivities and sensitivities for large parameter variations."
"New classes of low-pass filters with no finite zeros having a monotonic passband response are introduced by maximizing or minimizing the mean square error and changing the boundaries of the error integral. It is shown that all known classes of filters with monotonic passband magnitude response (Butterworth, Legendre, LSM, and Halpern filters) are obtained as special cases of this type of approximation."
"This paper presents methods used in the design of precise coaxial cable simulation networks for digital line repeaters. The insertion loss of the longest simulated cable varies between 5 and 54 dB from 2.7 to 275 MHz. The design combines classicalRLsynthesis, precise modeling and optimization techniques. Success depends on systematic minimization of and design with unavoidable parasitic capacitances."
"It is important to know whether an operating point of a nonlinear network exists in a certain range. We consider dc equations of nonlinear networks which are characterized by continuous functions. Conditions are presented such that a bounded set containing an operating point is determined. The conditions show that close relations exist between eventual passivity and the existence of an operating point in a bounded set. Network examples are included to illustrate the application of the conditions. Piecewise-linear analysis is used to search an operating point in the determined set. If the bounded set is divided into \"nonoverlapping\" simplices, a continuous piecewise-linear function can be interpolated on it to approximate the function describing the nonlinear network. It turns out that this method preserves properties needed for the implementation of piecewise-linear analysis."
"For the class of nonlinear systemsS_{M}, the structure of the identification problem based on steady-state frequency response is considered. Two approaches using amplitude and phase measurements are presented, one of which requires measurements of only the first two harmonics of the steady-state response. Furthermore it is shown that with a minimum phase restriction the system can be identified from amplitude measurements of the first two harmonics. In each case we obtain a considerable reduction in the number of measurements and inputs required by previous approaches."
"Periodic sequences are usually generated by shift registers with feedback using mod 2 arithmetic. In this paper we analyze periodic sequence generators using ordinary arithmetic. It is shown that the simplest periodic sequence generators using ordinary arithmetic are linear. An exact expression is given for the smallest number of stages required to generate periodic sequences of a given period. A table of maximum period attainable using a given number of stages is also included. A canonical form for optimal periodic sequence generators is described. It is shown that an implementation using analog storage and arithmetic elements (like CCD shift registers and operational amplifier) it is possible to obtain multilevel periodic sequences with the optimal sequence generators."
"A four-stage algorithm for the efficient solution of the standard eigenvalue problem for large sparse matrices is presented. The matrix whose eigenvalues are desired is first reduced to a block upper triangular form, if possible, to expose those eigenvalues that are readily identified. The reduced matrix Is then scaled and transformed to a sparse Hessenberg matrix with numerical stability control. Laguerre's iteration is then used to find the remaining eigenvalues. Examples are given."
"Two major topics are discussed: macromodularity and latency. The macromodular approach uses the tearing procedure, modified nodal analysis, symbolicLUfactorization techniques, and separate updating and convergence tests, to take full advantage of large sparse networks with highly repetitive subnetworks. An efficient algorithm requiring only the updating of a small portion of the Jacobian matrix when individual solution vectors do not converge is presented, and the storage requirements and computation efforts to obtain a complete solution are estimated. The latent approach takes advantage of the temporary cessation of network activity between stimulation and response through knowledge of actual stimulation and the history of the internal node voltages. This approach is fully utilized by defining latent directed paths. A \"latent graph\" theory is proposed, and some results are presented."
"Two methods of implementing computer programs for solving the shortest path problem are presented. By symbolic processing, a computer program generates another program or an address table which represents an optimal shortest path algorithm, in the sense that only nontrivial operations required for a given particular network structure are executed. The implementation methods presented here are powerful when a network of fixed sparseness structure must be solved repeatedly with different numerical values."
"In this paper mathematical models for use in a topological approach to solving the circuit layout problem are outlined. After a brief survey of some existing models, an improved model is suggested. This model is based on the concept of partially oriented graph and contains more topological information than earlier models. This reduces the need for special constraints on the graph embedding algorithm. The models also allow pin and gate assignment in function of the layout under certain conditions."
"Several optimal-aim control strategies for large-scale nonlinear regulation and tracking systems are discussed. A theorem concerning explicit optimal-aim control laws with adaptive-feedback implementations, an example of its application to a transient power-system model, and a qualitative comparison of the optimal-aim strategy and a classical optimalcontrol strategy for a linear harmonic-oscillator model are given."
"Packet switching broadcast radio networks are receiving considerable attention as a feasible solution for applications involving fast network deployment requirements, inaccessible physical environments, and mobile communication devices. Such networks also offer economic alternatives to traditional multiplexing schemes for local distribution. Routing algorithms which enable point-to-point packet transportation have been developed for broadcast radio networks. It appears that a routing algorithm becomes more efficient when the number of alternate paths are restricted; on the other hand, reliability considerations suggest increasing the number of alternate paths. In this paper, we study and compare the reliability of broadcast radio networks for different routing algorithms."
"A technique is presented for dynamically selecting the \"best\" path for disseminating information throughout a network on the basis of assigning ranks to the nodes and demerits to the links. One possible application of this technique is in the selection of paths for disseminating precise time information throughout a network from the best nodal clock to nodes whose clocks have less precision. The method uniquely defines and iteratively selects the path of least demerit from each node to the highest ranking node regardless of the initial conditions or perturbations to the network structure."
"In this note a bipartite graph representation is proposed for the study of pivot strategies on sparse matrices. Using this representation, an algorithm which fullfills the Brayton's condition for Gaussian elimination optimality has been devised."
"Multiple path requirements for networks with integer line capacities (multigraphs) can be stated in a very general form by a reliabilIty matrixR, wherer(i,j)is the specified lower bound on the number of line-disjoint paths between points\\upsilon_{i}and\\upsilon_{j}in the multigraph. In light of the classical \"max-flow, min-cut\" theorem, this is equivalent to specifying local line connectivities. This paper presents a new and conceptually simple algorithm for constructing minimum size (total number of lines) multigraphs which satisfy the requirements specified in a reliability matrix."
"Suppose we have an imprecise estimate of arc flows in a given network, either through prior measurements under similar conditions, or through observation of related phenomena; how can we use imprecise measurements of boundary flows into and out of the network to improve our original estimate? This is a problem in Bayesian regression that is difficult to carry out, in general. However, by using a linearized approach due to credibility theory that is similar to results in linear filter theory, one can find interesting and useful estimates using only first and second moments of the prior and observation error distributions. This result has application in road and communication traffic measurement, statistical auditing, and nuclear material accountability problems."
"The need for a network model for the purpose of study of stability of flows is first discussed. A dynamic flow-network model is then presented. It has applications to power networks. A two-matrix transformation method is used to find a suitable Liapunov function. Stability conditions are then obtained when some constraints are imposed on the dynamic components and on the connectivity of the network. The conditions are like a circle criterion, which are on the bounds of the conductances, the memoryless components of the network."
"This letter describes a new routing algorithm which is oriented towards floating via technology in a two-sided environment. The algorithm builds up \"saturated zones\" of interconnections and then combines these saturated zones by four tactics which attempt to complete a maximum number of paths selected from a restricted set of path shapes. A router based on this algorithm has been implemented, and has averaged 99.4 percent completion on 24 Illiac IV boards, and attained 100 percent completion on a large printed wiring board. The router averages about one via per wire, uses modest storage, and is generally economical."
"Two elementary approaches are presented for analyzing large-scale linear resistive networks by first tearing them apart, solving the torn subnetworks separately, and then interconnecting the results to obtain the solution of the overall network. The first approach makes use of elementary graph- and circuit-theoretic concepts and leads to a unified formulation which includes all existing versions of diakoptic analysis based on Kron's original ideas as special cases. The second approach consists of an appropriate partitioning of the network elements and a manipulation of the linear algebraic equations into the form of a generalized hybrid analysis involving a matrix having a bordered block-diagonal structure. These two distinct approaches are shown to be equivalent in the sense that the first is a special case of the second. The result is then extended to nonlinear networks, where an efficient computational algorithm is presented which takes full advantage of sparse matrix techniques and is compatible with parallel computations."
"A generalized method of tearing, or diakoptics, for solving large-scale networks is derived. The idea of diakoptics is viewed as simply the partition of branches and the Kirchhoff laws. A solution algorithm based on LU decomposition is presented. If the network may be \"torn apart,\" then the computations at the subnetwork level can be carried out independently. We present an example which is a family of networks with a parameter p and show that diakoptics, compared to the conventional network analysis, sometimes saves computations and sometimes requires more computations."
"We study the input-output stability of arbitrary interconnections of nonlinear, time-varying, multivariable subsystems which may be either continuous-time or discrete-time. All subsystems are specified by their input-output description. We use an algorithmic decomposition of the overall system into a hierarchy of strongly connected subsystems (SCS) interacting through inter-connection subsystems (IS). Theorem I establishes that the overall system is stable once the SCS's and the IS's are stable. Theorem II shows that, under very reasonable assumptions, these sufficient conditions are actually necessary. Using the concept of minimum essential set, we partition each SCS into two parts: one part corresponds to the \"forward subsystem\" whose only feedbacks are self-loops; the other part corresponds to the vertices of the minimum essential set; together they form the overall feedback system. Simplified stability conditions for the SCS are obtained by exploiting this structural decomposition. Theorem III gives sufficient condition for stability of nonlinear time-varying SCS's. The other three theorems consider linear time-invariant continuous-time, lumped as well as distributed SCS's. We provide translation rules for reformulating these three theorems for the discrete-time case. We also show how to reduce the amount of calculation involved in finding the SCS characteristic polynomial."
"Some new results are presented concerning the decomposition and pivoting of large sparse systems of linear equations. The paper uses graph theoretical reasoning. Starting point are some results of Rose on triangulated graphs, separation sets, and optimal ordering of sparse matrices. In the paper it is proven that a graph (and thus at the same time the matrix it represents) can be \"split\" (\"torn\") by certain vertex sets (unknowns) such that the overall number of \"fill-ins\" may still be optimum, although ordering is done in all components (submatrices) separately and almost independently. The results may have some significance for very large systems where they may assist in cutting down on set up time. Also some impact on the study of the possible benefits of using more than one floating point processor in parallel may be expected."
"The multilayer routing problem is introduced and its relation to the single-row single-layer routing problem is illustrated [1], [2]. An easily implementable sufficient condition on the routability of a net list over a single row of nodes is presented. The solution is given by a constructive forward marching procedure and the result is an improvement over the worst-case prediction of So [1]. The implementation algorithm is programmed on CDC 6400 computer. The nature of the optimum criterion relating to single-row routability is investigated and a necessary and sufficient condition is given to characterize the nature of optimality. Some necessary conditions are also presented which can be used to evaluate the sufficient condition and served as a lower bound for the channel capacity in the routing problem. The more general routing problem is illustrated and possible future research directions are discussed."
"An important and basic characterization of a graph is the sequence or list of degrees of that graph. Problems regarding the construction of graphs with specified degrees occur in chemistry and in the design of reliable networks. A list of nonnegative integers is called graphical if there is a graph (called a realization) with the given list as its degree list. The usual algorithms for determining whether a given list is graphical are derived from the effect on a graphical list of the removal of a point from a graph. After reviewing such an algorithm by Havel-Hakimi and its generalization by Wang and Kleitman, we develop a corresponding algorithm based on the removal of a line from a graph. We conclude by reviewing and providing simple proofs of algorithms for a list to be multigraphical due to Hakimi and Butler. The conditions relating a graphical or multigraphical list to the point and line connectivity of their realizations, due to Edmonds, Wang and Kleitman, Boesch and McHugh, and Hakimi, are presented along with new and simple proofs of the multigraph case."
"This paper deals with tearing methods for the solution of a large scale system of linear algebraic equations. A modification algorithm Is presented and evaluated with respect to other available techniques, namely, Householder's formula and Bennet's algorithm. Then, an optimization problem related to the \"best\" way of tearing a given matrixAwith a certain associated structure is stated and solved by proving it to be equivalent to the determination of a minimum essential set of a suitably defined hypergraphH. A branch-and-bound algorithm for minimum essential set inH, based on a number of local reduction rules is outlined. Finally, the application of the obtained results to the tearing problem is discussed and its complexity compared withLUdecomposition method."
"The simulation of the transient response of a large interconnected power system involves the solution of a very large system of differential-algebraic equations under a great variety of initial conditions and disturbances. The demands imposed on a digital transient stability program to i) study larger power system interconnections, ii) provide a more detailed representation of the power system components, and iii) permit the simulation of longer time periods, have the effect of increasing the computing time. The importance of, and the need for, efficient computational schemes is apparent. The method presented in this paper makes detailed use of the structural properties of the differential-algebraic system representation. The nonlinear differential-algebraic system is split into a nonstiff part with long time constants coupled to a stiff part with a sparse Jacobian matrix whose longest time constant is shorter than that of the first part. These two parts are linear in their respective states, i.e., the system is semilinear. With the nonstiff part removed, a smaller set of stiff equations with a smaller conditioning number than the original system is obtained. Consequently, longer stepsizes can be used so as to reduce the computation time. The proposed multistep integration schemes exploit the stiffness and semilinearity properties. Numerical results on a small test problem indicate that these schemes operate with good accuracy at stepsizes as large as 100 times those necessary to ensure numerical stability by more conventional schemes."
 "Bessel-type polynomials are defined and shown to be useful in constructing a variety of transfer functions in filter theory. A generalized Bessel filter and a generalized Bessel rational filter are considered and shown to include a number of special cases of Bessel-type filters. The greater flexibility of the generalized filters is exploited to obtain a variety of filter responses."
"In a previous paper simple rules had been derived which allow one to design arbitrary full-synchronic wave digital filters in such a way that neither overflow nor granularity oscillations can occur. These results are extended to half-synchronic wave digital filters."
 "The \"leap frog\" active synthesis technique is generalized to include simulations of more generalLCladder networks such that a one-to-one correspondence' between reactive elements and active integrators is maintained. This is accomplished through the introduction of two special \"port reciprocators\" which together with a set of basic signal flow graph building blocks and a set of interconnection rules forms a complete active synthesis technique. A design example is presented and a method of reducing the number of amplifiers required is outlined."
"The use of \"active compensation\" in precision electronic circuits employing modernICop amps, whereby the op amps in a circuit provide \"self-compensating\" effects to mitigate their finite bandwidth limitations is discussed. In particular, several rather subtle applications in the field ofRCactive filters are presented. A number of novel integrator circuits having high performance are presented, and experimental results which support the theoretical derivations are given. Using these integrators considerably extends the useful frequency range of the \"leap-frog\" and \"coupled-biquad\" active filters, at no extra cost."
"The derivation is given of previously published results for the unconditional stability criteria of active 2-port networks, in terms ofSparameters, that are not only simpler than earlier results but symmetrical, i.e.,"
"A general class of transfer functions of maximally flat group delay low-pass filters with equal-ripple attenuation in the stopband and flat attenuation in the passband is investigated. Filter transmission zeros are calculated and listed in a table."
"A new method for the solution of nonlinear periodic networks has been developed. It avoids the time domain solution of the dynamic equations. In the proposed method, the network is decomposed into a minimum number of linear and nonlinear subnetworks. Only frequency domain solutions of the linear subnetworks are required. It is shown that considerable reduction in the size of the computational problem can be achieved by taking advantage of the linearities present in the network."
"We consider the class of large-scale dynamical systems consisting of identical subsystems, but with complex connectivity. It is shown that the irreducibility of this large system is directly related to the irreducibility of a simple system, which is obtained by a replacement of the subsystems by integrators."
"An arbitrary number of van der Pol oscillators mutually coupled by inductances or capacitances (i.e., a low-pass and a high-pass ladder oscillator) is investigated using the equivalent linearization technique of Kryloff and Bogoliuboff. The network is almost linear and is described by a nonlinear vector differential equation. The active element is assumed to be a cubic nonlinear shunt conductance. It is demonstrated that 1) nonresonant simultaneous double-mode oscillation can be stably excited in a ladder oscillator in which both end cells are opened, 2) but it is not excited in a ladder oscillator in which both end cells are grounded, 3) and more than three modes can not be excited in any ladder oscillator. Experiments confirm that nonresonant simultaneous double-mode oscillation can be excited stably in a ladder oscillator in which both end cells are opened. The experimental amplitudes and oscillating frequencies agree well with theoretical values."
"A commonly accepted mathematical model for the electrical activity of the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals comprises a set of interconnected oscillators of the Van der Pol type. The method of harmonic balance is used to obtain analytical results for the entrainment conditions of two or more Van der Pol oscillators mutually coupled between their \"x\" outputs. Two stable limit cycles are shown to exist with frequency ratios which can be adjusted by changing the coupling factor. The limit cycles have different amplitudes and phase shift in accordance with physiological data obtained from the human colon. It is shown analytically that there is a minimum value of coupling factor below which, for a given waveshape factor and frequency, only one stable limit cycle exists. This latter condition matches the measured data from the human small intestine. For oscillators having different uncoupled frequencies a hill-climbing method is used on the algebraic equations to obtain entrainment conditions and in particular the phase shift between oscillators. The analytical and hill-climbing results are compared throughout with analog simulation studies."
"An algorithm for finding the eigenvalues of the generalized eigenvalue problemAx = {\\lambda}Bxfor sparseAandBmatrices is discussed. Its performance is compared to that of theQZalgorithm for some test matrices."
 "A statistical multiparameter measure suited to the analysis and design of notch filters is described. The measure may be used to analyze and optimize the sensitivity performance of second-order notch filters. Sensitivities evaluated using the approximate measure are compared to those obtained from Monte Carlo analysis. The design of minimum sensitivity second-order notch filters is demonstrated. Finally the recent second-order (high-pass) notch realizations of Boctor and Friend et al. (SAB) are compared."
"Through a generalization of the maximally flat magnitude (MFM) functions proposed by O'Neill and Ghausi a class of MFM driving point functions with a pole at infinity and a prescribed real part as w tends to infinity is derived. These functions can be used in the design of equalizer networks to parasitic reactances and yield a larger gainbandwidth product."
"The realization of a digital transfer function using a variation of partial fraction is accomplished. By this method, the obtained network features a new cascade network structure. Further, this paper proves relationships between coefficients of the digital transfer function and the values of the network elements."
"The present paper discusses the arc-length method that analyzes frequency response curve of the dynamic nonlinear network, driving-point, and transfer characteristic curves of the nonlinear resistive networks [1]. Although each point of the characteristic curve can be obtained by the numerical approaches [2]-[6] of the nonlinear equation, our arc-length method can trace the curve continuously if only we find a point of the curve."
"A theory of optimal worst-case design embodying centering, tolerancing, and tuning is presented. Some simplified problems and special cases are discussed. Projections and slack variables are used to explain some of the concepts. The worst-case tolerance assignment and design centering problem falls out as a special case. Practical implementation requires a reasonable and'relevant number of parameters and constraints to be identified to make the problem tractable. Two circuits, a simpleLClow-pass filter and a realistic high-pass filter, are studied under a variety of different problem situations to illustrate both the benefits to be derived from our approach and the difficulties encountered in its implementation."
"A degenerate n-port resistance network is one which, as a result of topological constraints, requires an equation to be satisfied among some of the elements of the short-circuit conductance matrix of the network. Biorci and Civalleri have studied and reported results on(n + 2)-terminal degenerate resistance networks. In this paper, we point out an error which they made, and give conditions which partially characterize degeneracy in(n + p)-terminal networks, forpgreater than 2, in terms of complementary network graphs that contain complete bipartite subgraphs."
"The aim of this paper is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for ann-port network to be planar, coplanar, and totally planar. Generally, a planar graph does not have a unique plane representation, and a combinatorial problem arises in determining whether the graph is planar, coplanar, or totally planar. To avoid the combinatorial complexity the graph is decomposed into 3-connected components called atoms. Since atoms have unique sets of boundaries and coboundaries, our planarity and coplanarity conditions, which are established on atoms, may be easily examined on any plane representations of the atoms."
"In this paper, the synthesis problem of multi-terminal nets is formulated as a mathematical programming problem. An algorithm based on Balinski's procedure of finding all the vertices of a convex polyhedra is described to determine one or all the feasible solutions of the synthesis problem."
"In crystal filter design the use of low-pass prototype networks containing frequency invariant reactances is well known. It is shown in this paper that if this concept is extended to the double-resonator monolithic crystal filter (MCF) section, then all the classical transmission zero producing networks, e.g., the Brune, Darlington C-type, and Darlington D-type, may be realized in a form containing low-pass prototype MCF sections. This result allows the techniques of reciprocal cascade synthesis to be applied to the direct synthesis of arbitrary lossless even degree transfer functions in crystal filter form. Explicit expressions are given by which the prototype MCF element values may be obtained"
"A design procedure for video amplifiers is discussed that will 1) determine if a specific op amp can be used to satisfy the design, 2) minimize the number of stages required, and 3) determine individual stage gains required to satisfy the design. A figure of merit, based on device parameters and the specific amplifier requirements, is developed to aid the design procedure. The design procedure is directed toward practical application in that it minimizes component cost, eliminates trial and error methods, and is directly applicable to worst-case design."
"A multiloop active filter circuit of Kerwin is shown to yield a VCO whose oscillation frequency is conveniently controlled with one variable resistor. Using an FET to obtain the voltage variable resistor, experimental results are shown to agree with the theory developed."
 "A formula to determine the characteristic function ofN x Nmatrix by discrete Fourier series is given."
"A method for computer aided noise analysis is presented which is based on a description of noise by means of correlation matrices. The method is a two-port analysis and it is, therefore, applicable to circuits which are composed of simple two-ports with known noise performance. The correlation matrix concept holds two main advantages over other methods of noise analysis. Partially correlated noise sources can be treated without any loss of efficiency and information concerning minimum noise figure and noise matching conditions is obtained."
"The present paper presents a new technique for the design of multidimensional FIR digital filters. Given the desired amplitude respinse, the truncation error, of a low-order approximation to a high-order filer\" is iteratively decreased by varying the phase response. Convergence of the iterative algorithm is discussed. Examples illustrating the use of the technique are included. The design method is formulated for twodimensional filters, however filters of any dimension may be designed by this technique."
"This paper discusses an approach to the Implementation of a linear phase finite impulse response filter for which the cutoff frequency is controlled through a small number of parameters. The approach is based on a transformation implemented by replacing a subnetwork in a prototype network."
"To appreciate adequately digital filtering with one semester or less of class work, a laboratory must be provided. Simulation on a general-purpose digital computer does not give an adequate feel for the processing of signals of various waveshapes. If the student must build the filters from commercially availableICpackages there is not enough time in one semester to build more than the simplest filter. Described herein is a hardware laboratory which provides the student with hardware components that perform the mathematical operations that are normally used in digital filter equations. The equipment is such that the student begins with simple filters, proceeds to more complicated signal processing, and then learns how to share hardware to reduce costs. Finally, a highly multiplexed computer controlled filter is provided for the student to design and test high-order filters. Guidelines for those who wish to build such a laboratory are given."
"An analogy is pointed out betweenR, \\pm L, \\pm Cnetworks and networks of resistors, linear controlled resistors, and linear controlled conductors. Applications ofR, \\pm LCR, \\pm LCGnetworks in realizing nonlinear curves are discussed, and experimental corroboration of the basic ideas is included."
"Regionalization is a method by which the joint probability density for two or more jointly distributed random variables can be estimated when only their respective frequency distributions or intervariable tracking specifications are known. The method can be used to improve the performance of circuit analysis programs in two ways: by weighting the samples to reduce the number of trials required for a statistical analysis, and by partitioning the output space in order to determine the input combinations that are most likely to cause failure."
"It is shown that correlation between quantization error sources in finite precision fixed point digital filters can be significant even when a filter is driven by a random input. It is demonstrated that correlation coefficients can be estimated in terms of relative values of multiplying constants and the filter structure. A general formulation of filter output noise is developed in terms of the covariance matrices of the error sources. Thus the effects of correlation can be taken into account analytically for purposes of design and comparison."
"A mixed order finite-element technique is utilized, to solve - Rectangular the Integral equations governing the charge density distribution in a planar Fin~ite-_Eulment multiconductor configuration on a dielectric sheet. The capacitive lumped equivalent model for such a circuit is determined. The four-dimensional integrals with singular integrands, resulting from the formulation, are evaluated symbolically. The method is implemented in a package called PARCAP, and is shown to be competitive with the other programs available at this time. Thin film Interdigitated capacitors were measured to lend support to the accuracy and usefulness of PARCAP in circuit design."
  "An algorithm is presented for optimal source location for a lossy distribution tree network."
"A new design technique for digital filters is proposed. This technique can be used to design digital filters whose response best approximates a prescribed magnitude and group delay response. The proposed technique is well suited for the design of filters with constant group delay response in the passband."
"A bound for the quantization error in second-order digital filters with complex conjugate poles is found that is very good for certain values of 0 and is practical to calculate."
"A new numerical algorithm is presented which determines the coefficients of a low-pass nonequal-ripple modified Chebyshev function with multiplicity of the dominant root pair greater than one; as a result its degree is higher than the corresponding Chebyshev polynomial but a much lower dominant rootQ-factorQ_{c}is obtained. Intermediate modified Chebyshev functions with higher transition region attenuation and therefore increasedQ_{c}are also discussed."
"A certain disadvantage of scattering parameter RC-active filters is the great number of necessary active elements. In this paper a method is presented which provides a means to implement scattering parameter active filters with fewer active components. A decrease of the maximum voltage peaks within the filters due to resonant effects is an additional advantageous feature of the proposed approach."
"A new result in resistance network synthesis is proved, namely, that any fourth-order singular and quasi-singular matrix is realizable as a resistance and a conductance matrix if and only if it is paramount. Indefinite and quasi-indefinite matrices are treated first, followed by nonindefinite singular and quasi-singular matrices. Canonic networks and element-value formulas are given for all cases. In addition, it is pointed out that the new result includes the fourth-order solution to an open problem stated by Nambiar."
"Sufficient conditions for the realization of a real symmetric matrix as the short-circuit conductance matrix of an(n + 2)-node resistive n-port network are established. The properties of networks of departure and paddingn-port networks are used to arrive at these results. It is shown that any(n x n)real symmetric matrix realizable by an(n + 1)-noden-port network can also be realized by an(n + 2)-noden-port network containing at mostn(n + 1)/2conductances if all the zero conductances of the corresponding(n + 1)- node realizationN, form part of a fundamental cut-set in N with respect to the port tree ofN."
"Sufficient conditions for theL_{\\infty}- andl_{\\infty}-boundedness of nonlinear interconnected systems are established. Systems which may be viewed as an interconnection of single-loop feedback systems are considered. Overall boundedness conditions are phrased in terms of the margins by which each subsystem satisfies a certain boundedness condition. The existence of similar results for theL_{\\infty}-andl_{\\infty}-continulty of nonlinear interconnected systems is noted."
"Closed-form expressions are given for two classes of nonminimum-phase transfer functions in lumped-element, microwave, and digital filters. The first exhibits simultaneous maximally flat amplitude and delay characteristics about the origin({\\lambda} = 0). The second maintains the maximally flat amplitude response while possessing one delay condition less than the maximum possible number. The functions have general numerators (i.e., containing odd as well as even powers), thus allowing considerable freedom for control of both amplitude and delay. The results indicate that the amplitude response of the second class of functions possesses sharper cutoff than the first. On the other hand, functions belonging to the first class are more suitable for cases where the delay specifications are very stringent and/or the passbands are relatively wide."
"The concept and theory of thepth-order inverse of a nonlinear system es developed in this article. Thepth-order inverse,K_{(p)}^{-1}, of a systemHis defined as a system for which the Volterra series of the systemQformed by the tandem connection ofK_{(p)}^{-1}andHisQ[x]= x+ \\Sigma_{n=p+1}^{\\infty} Q_{n}[x]so that the 2nd through thepth-order Volterra operators ofQare zero. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence ofK_{(p)}^{-1}are determined. It is shown that thepth-order pre-inverse of a systemHis identical to itspth-order post-inverse. In addition, a synthesis ofK_{(p)}^{-1}is obtained. Thepth-order inverse offers an approach to the study of the system inverse,H^{-1}, since, asp \\rightarrow \\infty , K_{(p)}^{-1}becomes the Volterra series ofH^{-1}. This approach is discussed and some applications with regard to nonlinear differential equations and nonlinear feedback systems are presented."
"Graph-theoretic concepts are used to deduce properties of nonlinear networks and properties of nonlinear resistiven-ports. The basic result is that if the ports of ann-port form no cutsets (resp., loops), then each port voltage (resp., port current) is a linear function of the internal element voltages (resp., currents) only; i.e., no other external port voltage (resp., port current) is involved. This result is very general in the sense that it is independent of the constitutive relations of the internaln-port elements. It is also a rather subtle result because it forms the basis of a large number of new network andn-port theorems. For example, in examining the closure properties ofn-ports, this result is used to show, among other things, that if the ports of ann-port form neither loops nor cutsets, and if the internal resistors are strictly passive, or strictly increasing, then then-port is also strictly passive, or strictly increasing. Moreover, many of these conclusions remain valid when then-port contains independent voltage and current sources. The main result is extended to a network containing capacitors, inductors, resistors, and sources. Here, graph-theoretic conditions are given such that the voltage and current waveforms of the capacitors and inductors are functions of the resistor and source voltage and current waveforms. Dynamic nonlinear networks containing capacitors, inductors, resistors, and sources such that there are loops of capacitors, or cutsets of inductors are shown to be equivalent to networks without such loops or cutsets. Explicit analytical expressions are given for specifying the constitutive relations of the elements of the equivalent circuit. This result allows the generalization of many previous results in nonlinear networks which exclude capacitor loops and inductor cutsets."
"Inductorless variable equalizers using networks with feedback and feedforward are investigated. They comprise two shaping networks, two adders, and a single variable gain element. They work over a full variation range and the variable element can share a common grounded terminal. The design of the variable characteristics is quite straightforward compared with conventional types. Equalization errors caused by component imperfection in this type of variable equalizer are analyzed and compensation methods for these errors are investigated. Some practical examples are given that prove the efficiency of the error compensation and the feasibility of this type of variable equalizer. Variable equalizers with high-input and low-output impedances using three or four transistors are illustrated. Owing to their simple structures and weak feedback and feedforward, they can be used in video or higher frequency bands. Experiments using transistors with anf_{\\tau}of I GHz were performed over a ± 7-dB variation range and a bandwidth of 20 MHz."
"In high-frequency applications using operational amplifiers, I~~~~~~~~ the undesirable phase shift produced by the amplifiers often degrades -1 circuit performance. In this paper, simple operational-amplifier circuit units are described, which can give leading or lagging phase as desired. These units can be used for cancellation of undesired phase in a variety of 1 V2 circuits, thereby improving their high-frequency performance vastly. Ex- R (m-1)R amples are given, of the applications of these variable-phase units inRC-oscillators and high-QactiveRC-filters."
"An algorithm for the optimization of nonlinear circuits which are operating in periodic steady state is discussed. This algorithm makes use of an efficient steady-state analysis technique to find a network's periodic response. Suggestions are also given for reducing the computational cost of the algorithm."
"Digital ladder filter networks may be realized by applying simple transformations to the flow-graph network representation of continuous domain resistively terminatedLCtwo ports. It is shown that such methods have the disadvantage that there does not exist a transformation with the three requirements that the entire imaginarys-plane axis map to thez-plane unit circle, that the resultant discrete network is stable and finally that the resultant discrete network be computationally realizable due to Its freedom from delay free loops. A synthesis technique is proposed for low sensitivity digital ladders. The conventional transformation that is applied to theLCfilter prototype does lead to a stable structure with the required mapping property; the delay free loops are eliminated by straightforward flow-graph manipulation. The coefficient sensitivity of the magnitude transfer function|H(e^{f{\\omega}T}|is low valued throughout the passband."
"We present in this paper some of the relationships and applications of the operator model theory of Sz-Nagy and Foias to system and network theory. The three basic objects of the Nagy-Foias theory are: a special Hilbert space called the Nagy-Foias space, an operator on this space called the compressed shift operator, and the characteristic operator function of a contraction operator. It will be shown that these objects fit naturally in the state space realization of linear systems, and in the scattering synthesis of linear passive networks. We conclude the paper with a brief discussion of the Jordan model for a class of operators, and some of its potential applications to systems and networks."
"In this paper the Rosenblum-Ghausi multiparameter statistical measure [1] is extended for the more general case where instead of circuit element changes we consider complex parameter variations. The generalization is especially useful in the case of active two-ports described by complex matrix parameters as well as in some cases for comparison of activeRCnetworks and consideration of active block \"criticalness.\" Examples of applying the extended measure are given."
"The effective application of equivalence transformations to active networks has been prevented by the difficulties produced by the nonsymmetric terms introduced by the active elements. These problems are overcome by constraint theory, and it is demonstrated how equivalent networks can be generated for active structures in which important parameters such as component spread and value, and sensitivity, can be optimized. Methods of controlling the number of elements in the equivalent networks are also given."
"Several theorems are presented which predict in a qualitative manner the behavior of a large class of dynamic nonlinear networks containing coupled and multiterminal resistors, inductors, and capacitors. A very general and rather surprising result is presented which guarantees that most autonomous and nonautonomous dynamic nonlinear active networks of practical interest have no finite \"forward\" escape time solutions. In the case of autonomous networks, sufficient conditions are given which guarantee that the solution waveforms possess various forms of stability properties. The concepts of eventual passivity and eventual strict passivity are invoked to guarantee that all solution waveforms are bounded and eventually uniformly bounded, respectively. The properties of reciprocity and monotonicity (local passivity) are invoked to guarantee that all solutions are completely stable. The further imposition of a growth condition guarantees that all solutions will converge to a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point. In this case, the magnitude of all solutions is shown to be bounded between two exponential waveforms for all timet > 0. An algorithm is presented which computes for the maximum \"transient decay\" time constant associated with the upper bounding exponential. The main features of the majority of the theorems presented in this paper are that their hypotheses are simple and easily verifiable-often by inspection. The hypotheses are of two types: first, very general conditions on the network state equations and second, conditions on the individual element characteristics and their interconnections. The hypotheses and proofs of the latter type of theorems depend heavily upon the graphtheoretic results of an earlier paper [14] and involve solely the examination of the global nature of each element's constitutive relation and the verification of a topological \"loop-cutset\" conditions."
"Transfer functions are derived which yield a monotonic step response, or equivalently positive impulse response, and which yield maximum asymptotic cutoff for the degree of the network. The impulse response of the networks is approximated accurately byh_{n}(t)=K_{n}(sin{\\pi}t)^{n}, 0<t<1_{n}(t)=0, 1 < tThe transfer functions are all ladder realizable requiring no redundant elements."
 "One of the new filters to emerge in recent years has a magnitude response which is maximally flat beyond the origin. The filter is a generalization of the Butterworth filter. This letter presents a study of this filter including its magnitude, delay, and step responses. A filter design nomograph is also presented. These results are compared with other classical filter types. It is shown that this filter provides an attractive alternative to Butterworth, Chebyshev, Papoulis, and Halpern filters."
"Two new interesting structures for realizing two-dimensional recursive digital filters based on continued fraction expansion are discussed."
"An operational-amplifier filter circuit is presented, which can realize a highQat high frequencies, with low sensitivity to both the passive circuit components and the operational-amplifier gain-bandwidth products. Unlike most of the reported high-Qhigh-frequency circuits, which use positive feedback, this is a negative-feedback circuit and is based on the principle of the two-integrator loop."
"This paper gives practical synthesis procedures for the design of shaped gain, wide-band, matched, dual loop feedback amplifiers that use a cascade of two common emitter transistor stages. These procedures are unique in that loading effects of the feedback networks are fully taken into account. A comparison example is constructed that shows this technique to be more than a viable alternative to existing single loop designs."
"Means of compensating for the finite gain bandwidth of operational amplifiers, when used in voltage-controlled voltage source and inverting integrator blocks, are described and are shown to virtually eliminate excess phase shifts over a prescribed frequency range. As applied to integrators, the compensating technique simultaneously reduces gain (period) and phase errors. The methods should prove of maximum advantage where trimming of theRCelements is difficult or expensive as in thin-film realizations. It is shown that the overall temperature stability of the compensated network can be significantly improved."
"This paper discusses the design of two-dimensional (2-D) linear-phase FIR digital filters by transformations of one-demensional (l-D) filters, using a technique first presented by McClellan. His original transformations are generalized and several algorithms are presented for the design of the generalized transformations. Examples are included to demonstrate, the versatility of the design method."
"A family of 2-D structures is presented for implementing 2-D FIR digital filters designed by means of a transformation of a 1-D design. These implementations are computationally efficient for filters up to degree 50 x 50 and are straightforward to program or build in hardware. Many details of the implementations are discussed such as its susceptibility to coefficient quantization and arithmetic roundoff. A comparison is made between these implementations and other implementations for 2-D FIR filters."
"Thez-transform of the truncated impulse response of a digital filter with poles, is a polynomial that is important in the stability analysis of certain types of block recursion and inverse digital filters. This paper presents new results on the zeros of these polynomials, extending the earlier work of Read and Burrus and also studies the effect of coefficient quantization on the zeros."
"A classic filter problem is the construction of minimumphase transfer functions which simultaneously possess linear phase in the passband and steep amplitude selectivity. This paper presents a detailed quantitative treatment of this problem for lossless transducers, and it is shown that the bandwidth for linear phase is strictly constrained independent of the complexity of the transducer once the amplitude selectivity is prescribed. Prototype, but nonrational, physically realizable transfer functions are constructed which satisfy the bandwidth constraints, and polynomials which approximate the prototypes are then calculated to yield physicalLClinear phase ladder networks. The resultant structures, though minimum phase, can have respectable selectivity and phase properties. For example, an 8-element ladder is synthesized which realizes flat delay to ± 2.5 percent over 80 percent of the passband, with 60 dB of loss at twice cutoff, and 3-dB passband tolerance. Finally, the paper shows how to further improve amplitude selectivity at the price of small amounts of nonlinear phase distortion, and quantitative measures of this improvement are presented."
"A theoretical treatment of singularities in nonlinear minimax optimization problems, which allows for a classification in regular and singular problems, is presented. A theorem for determining a singularity that is present in a given problem is formulated. A group of problems often used in the literature to test nonlinear minimax algorithms, i.e., minimax design of multisection quarter-wave transformers, is shown to exhibit singularities and the reason for this is pointed out. Based on the theoretical results presented an algorithm for nonlinear minimax optimization is developed. The new algorithm maintains the quadratic convergence property of a recent algorithm by Madsen et al. when applied to regular problems and it is demonstrated to significantly improve the final convergence on singular problems."
"To achieve highly accurate filter characteristics in hybrid integrated active filter circuits, a new tuning procedure for Sallen-andKey-type hybrid filters has been developed and implemented. The proposed tuning procedure takes into account the loss factor of thin-film capacitors and nonideal amplifiers. An example that describes the tuning procedure in detail is presented for a second-order low-pass filter. It is also applicable in the same manner to all second-order functions. The new tuning procedure replaces a previous approach that was iterative and therefore time consuming when high precision was required. The new approach guarantees the pole frequency to within 0.2 percent in one tuning step, and the poleQto within I percent in an additional step. The tuning procedure requires that the capacitors be measured to within 0.1 percent, the dissipation factor to within 10 percent, and the resistors to within 0.02 percent. With the aid of a computer, the procedure has been completely automated; it is therefore well suited for processing in manufacture. It is being used in on-line production of thin-film active filters."
"The number of spanning trees in an arbitrary graph or multigraph is obtained via a general formula involving eigenvalues of an associated matrix, This is shown to be particularly useful in the case of graphs (or multigraphs) which are joins, and a method for deriving the appropriate eigenvaiues of joins is given. As applications of this, concise general expressions are derived for the number of spanning trees in any wheel or top. For the ordinarynspoke wheelW_{n+1} = K_{1} + C_{n}the simple formula{\\Pi|_{r=1}^{n-1} (3-2 \\cos (2r{\\pi}/n))is derived. A more general concept of join of multigraphs is introduced, and this is applied to obtain a simple formula in terms of integers and cosines for the number of spanning trees in general multigraph wheels."
"Using known results in Steiner's problem, suboptimal algorithms are advanced for routing single nets subject to the minimum length constraint and multinets subject to the minimum length and maximum allowable channel capacity constraints. Implementation of the algorithm on a large number of randomly generated examples indicates feasibility of fast CPU execution time and good quality of solution in comparison with other existing algorithms."
"A generalized Volterra series expansion is given that describes the behavior of a time-invarient nonlinear network as a function of the nonlinear behavior of an individual component. This series arises from a recent generalization by Dwyer of Volterra series, namely, Fock spaces of rigged Hilbert spaces. Only in very special cases, e.g., when both the component and network are linear, is the resultant Volterra series simple enough for direct practical use."
"Discrete linear uniformly sampled digital filters are often employed in situations where there exists some preliminary linear analog continuous filtering operation. The latter continuous filter transfer functionP(s)is usually a low-pass function that is required for such purposes as reducing the effects of aliasing, limiting the dynamic range of the signal prior to digitization, etc. The realization ofP(s)is usually achieved quite independently of the realization of the subsequent discrete transfer functionH(z), wherez = e^{sT}. In this contribution, it is shown that maximally flat solutions exist for the composite transfer functionP(s) \\cdot H(z), so that it is possible to employ a simple baseband prefiliterP(s)which, combined withH(z), results in an overall maximally flat low-pass response."
"A new sensitivity measure is proposed 'that could be useful for comparison between or optimization of second-order filter cells. It can be related to the well-knownQ- and\\omega_{0}-sensitivities by a simple analytic expression, yet It Is a more realistic design criterion. Furthermore it is shown that high-Qcells should not be compared on basis of theirQ- sensitivities only."
"The sensitivities of the transfer function of a digital filter with respect to its coefficients are utilized to derive lower bounds on the roundoff noise output in the cases ofL_{\\infty}andL_{\\infty}scaling for fixed-point arithmetic. General bounds are produced which apply to any filter structure if rounding is performed after multiplication and the filter has already been scaled. For the parallel and cascade forms, alternate bounds are derived which apply to rounding after multiplication or summation and which do not require prior scaling. The alternate bounds arethus independent (or nearly so) of pairing, ordering, and transposition. Examples are presented which show that the bounds are reasonably tight."
"A change of variables is described which transforms the problem of designing a recursive digital filter to that of approximation by a ratio of polynomials on a finite interval. Some analytic techniqueS for the design of low-pass filters are presented, illustrating the use of the tfransformation. Also considered are methods for the design of phase equalizers."
"A brief survey of basic results on Hilbert networks is given. Theorems on the existence and uniqueness of a current distribution, some results of qualitative character, and some results concerning causality are presented. Moreover, properties of the driving point-set impedance (DPSI) are discussed."
"It is shown that the return-difference and the null return-difference functions of a feedback amplifier can be elegantly and compactly formulated in terms of the first- and the second-order cofactors of the elements of its indefinite-admittance matrix. The relationship between the generalized cofactors of the elements of the cutset-admittance matrix and the second-order cofactors is indicated. Based on these results, topological formulas for these functions are presented. The significance of the new formulation is that it avoids the necessity of interpreting the loop gain in terms of the actual signal transmission around the closed loops in a flow graph, which in many cases is very misleading."
"We give some new results on the rank of the incidence matrix of a graph when calculations are done over the real numbers and in the Boolean algebra with two elements."
"The method proposed by Fettweis is based on a linear mean square estimation of gain alone. In some truncation methods, an average signal offset is introduced. It is here proposed that this, too, should not be considered noise and consequently should also be removed."
"The effect of the nonideal characteristics of operational amplifiers such as finite frequency dependent gain and output impedance on the performance of some single amplifier simulated frequency dependent negative resistances (FDNR's) is analyzed. Equivalent circuits showing the parasitic elements due to nonideal characteristics of amplifier are given. In two configurations the FDNR is shown to have resistive and inductive parasitic elements in addition to series and shunt capacitances. The experimental results confirm the validity of the equivalent circuits. The effect of the slew rate of the operational amplifier on the maximum signal-handling capability is studied. The analysis and equivalent circuits give a clear physical concept of the effect of the nonideal amplifier characteristics on the simulated FDNR's and can be used for'predistorted design of filters with practical FDNR's."
"Beginning with an external specification of a digital filter, structures which minimize roundoff noise are investigated. After fixing the probability of overflow through anl_{2}scaling procedure, roundoff noise is studied via the internal structure of the filter using a state variable formulation. An output noise variance formula in terms of the internal structure is derived. Conditions for minimizing this output noise are established and realizations which meet these conditions are constructed. A new set of filter invariants called second-order modes are defined and shown to play a definitive role in minimal noise realizations. From these invariants, for example, one can calculate the minimal output noise variance of a given external specification. Numerical results are given which compare these new filter structures with the usual parallel and cascade connections of second-order filters, both theoretically and through simulations. For narrow-band filters, these new structures can be orders of magnitude better (in terms of output noise variance). One drawback of these new structures is a large increase in the number of multipliers needed to realize them. However, by applying the theory to subfilters connected in parallel and cascade, a good compromise between output noise and number of multipliers is obtained."
"A new method is suggested for solving the polynomial equationA(s)X(s)+B(s)Y(s)=C(s)whereA (s), B (s), C (s)are given polynomials andX (s), Y (s)are to be determined. The method is then used for the formulation of the partial-fraction expansion of transfer functions, and for computing the greatest common divisor of polynomials"
"This paper discusses the calculation of both differential and large change network sensitivity. Expressions are derived which are based solely on the evaluation of the network function of interest, no auxiliary functions or networks being considered. The development, which assumes the bilinear property of network functions, provides results for the differential sensitivity of the network function, its numerator and denominator; higher order sensitivities, large change sensitivity, and explores the relationship between large change and differential sensitivity."
"The multimode oscillator properties of a square array of van der Pol oscillators coupled by inductances are analyzed in the quasiharmonic approximation. The criteria for discriminating the stability of single, nonresonant double, and degenerate modes are shown. Two fundamental techniques are employed in the analysis. One is the equivalent-linearization technique developed by Kryloff and Bogoliuboff. The other is mode analysis. The analytical and experimental results for a (3 x 4)-section array are discussed as an example of the method."
"Several theorems are presented which predict in a qualitative manner the transient and steady-state behavior of a large class of nonautonomous dynamic nonlinear networks containing coupled and multiterminal resistors, inductors, capacitors, and time-varying sources. The input waveforms of the sources may be aperiodic, periodic, or almost periodic. Sufficient conditions are given which guarantee that the solution waveforms possess various forms of stability properties. The concepts of eventual passivity and eventual strict passivity are invoked to guarantee that all solution waveforms are bounded and eventually uniformly bounded, respectively, for all bounded inputs. In particular, conditions are given such that a \"small-signal\" input will give rise to a \"small-signal\" output, thereby justifying the validity of the small-signal analysis approach for this class of networks. The properties of reciprocity and monotonicity (local passivity) are invoked to guarantee that the network has a unique steady-state response for all bounded excitations. In particular, conditions are given such that a periodic (respectively, asymptotically almost periodic) input gives rise to a unique periodic (respectively, asymptotically almost periodic) output. Moreover, conditions are given such that the frequency spectrum of the output waveforms is a subset of all linear combinations of the frequency components of the input waveforms. A further imposition of a growth condition guarantees that all solution waveforms will converge to each other asymptotically. In particular, the magnitude of the differences between any two solutions is shown to be bounded between two exponential waveforms for all timet > 0. The main features of the majority of the theeorems presented in this paper are that their hypotheses are simple and easily verifiable-often by inspection. The hypotheses are of two types: first, very general conditions on the network state equations and second, conditions on the individual element characteristics and their interconnections. The hypotheses and proofs of the latter type of theorems depend heavily upon the graph-theoretic results of an earlier paper [14] and involve solely the examination of the global nature of each element's constitutive relation and the verification of a topological \"loop-cutset\" condition. Several counter examples are given to demonstrate that most of the theorems presented in this paper are the best possible for the class of networks under consideration in the sense that a slight weakening of any one hypothesis would invalidate the theorems."

"This paper describes a companded analog-to-digital (A/D) converter for voiceband signals that is simple and potentially inexpensive. The converter uses only 18 coarsely spaced analog levels. Fine resolution is obtained by oscillating between these levels at an increased speed and averaging the result over a Nyquist interval. The companding used in the converter is effectively the same as that of μ-255 pulse-code modulation (PCM). In the encoding process a one-bit code is generated at 256 000 samples/s. This 1-bit per sample signal can be transmitted and decoded directly, or a simple digital circuit will produce a 13-bit, 8-kHz linear PCM signal that can be compressed to 8-bit companded PCM format. In this paper the basic operation of the 1-bit coder is described and its performance when connected to a 1-bit decoder is illustrated. Methods for obtaining both linear and compressed PCM are then presented, and the properties of these PCM signals with respect to noise, gain tracking, and harmonic content are described. Relative insensitivity to circuit component variations, absence of analog gates, along with the need to generate only a few analog levels, make the coder especially well suited to integrated circuit realization."

"In February 1975 the Editor-in Cheif announced a new policy, that of restricting papers to be less than 20 pages in length. He is pleased to say that authors have cooperated, and as a result, this Transactions has been able to significantly reduce the number of pages published. Whereas in 1974 this Transactions published 1900 pages, in 1975 we published 1530 pages. The Editorial Board intends to continue to limit papers to 20 pages. By so doing, we hope to continue our policy of publishing every accepted manuscript as it is received, without a backlog."
"This correspondence presents an improved technique for receive error detecting a pseudorandom digital sequence suitable for bit error performance testing of serial digital transmission systems. The method is applicable to separately located transmit and receive sites, is self-synchronizing, and can be economically constructed using logic elements and medium-scale integrated (MSI) devices from commercially available logic families."
"The entropy of the output of three adaptive source encoders, AΔM, APCM, and ADPCM, is measured for speech inputs at low sampling rates. It is attempted to correlate the source encoder output entropies, normalized to the channel bit rate, with the results of informal listening tests. It was hypothesized that the channel bit rate utilization factor would predict subjective ranking of the source encoders. The results of measurements do not support this hypothesis; an intuitive explanation is offered."
"In a conditional replenishment coder for videotelephony only those picture elements (pels) which have changed significantly since the previous frame are transmitted. The amplitudes as well as the locations of these pels within the frame must be sent. In [2] locations are sent by addressing clusters of changed pels with respect to the beginning of the line. Increased addressing efficiency results if clusters of changes are positioned not with respect to the beginning of the line, but with respect to another cluster in the previous line or previous frame which has already been transmitted. Computer simulations using digitally stored videotelephone signals were carried out to evaluate such differential schemes. Results showed that differential addressing of this type and the use of variable word-length codes can yield about a 50 percent saving in bits required to address beginnings of clusters. The overall bit rate saving is much smaller, however, ranging from 10-15 percent depending on the efficiency with which pel amplitudes are coded."
"The original author notes that the Commentor (E. Henley) deserves full credit for first noticing the relationship between certain TH-1 distortion problems and secondorder sideband asymmetry. It is not apparent, however, that his IF equalizer bears any clear relationship to the equalizer discussed in my letter. Almost any adjustable IF equalizer can be made to favorably affect the noise in a particular noise slot, but in general it will not do so without adversely affecting other slots or other performance characteristics."
"It is shown that under certain moderate conditions, a large class of passband data signals, including all two-dimensional signal sets and many multilevel frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals, can be constructed from a finite set of stored waveforms. A description is given of a transversal filter with time-varying tap weights which can generate this class of signals. The configuration is amenable to digital implementation and to use in program-controlled systems."
"We present in this paper a unified approach to the crosstalk interference problem arising in PCM transmission on paired cables. For bipolar signaling, and three types of commonly used channel shaping, viz., cosine, raised cosine, and Gaussian, we present the minimum average near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk (FEXT) loss requirements at any transmission rate as a function of repeater spacing and number of interfering pairs so as to meet a desired error rate objective. This will aid in indicating if new cables need to be developed for a proposed rate of transmission or, for a given cable, the error margin available for degradations other than crosstalk can be readily determined. Extension to other coding schemes is indicated, and crosstalk compatibility is examined for mixedTsystems, such asT1,T1C, andT2. Graphical results are presented to readily aid in system design of anyTcarrier with repeater spacings up to 70 dB."
"In this concise paper the phase-lock loop (PLL) steady state characteristics for bandpass types of modulating spectra are determined. The usual assumption that the intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth is wide compared with PLL bandwidth is not made. The characteristics are determined from measurements on an experimental system and from theoretical calculations using a quasi-linear model (QLM) of the PLL. Experimental data are compared to theoretical data to determine the accuracy of the QLM over the PLL parameter space. The experimental results are used to provide design data and to arrive at conclusions concerning threshold, multiplier output variance, phase error variance, output signal-to-noise ratio, and signal distortion."
"A closed-form relationship is developed relating the range response, FM modulation, and demodulation functions for short-range FM radars such that, given two of the functions, the third may be determined. Synthesis and analysis techniques using the relation apply to a class of FM radars including both single- and dual-channel (directionalDoppler) systems with either deterministic or stochastis modulations. It is shown that any band-limited (BL) response may be obtained with few qualifications. Sample computations and simulation examples are included."
"The effect of digital errors in linear pulse code modulation (PCM) systems has been considered by several authors for channels with independent errors. In this paper we present a general approach of analyzing digital errors in linear and nonlinear PCM systems with arbitrary channels. The examples given in this paper cover the different standard nonlinear PCM systems and independent channel errors. The technique used for the analysis leads to the conclusion that there are PCM codes less sensitive to digital errors than the standard binary folded PCM code. An example of such a PCM code is given in this paper."
  "This paper describes the domestic and international rules, regulations, reports, and recommendations that have an impact on the design and operation of digital systems. The emphasis is on the technical and the radio frequency (RF) aspects, but nontechnical and baseband matters are mentioned briefly. Organizations discussed include the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the International Telephone and Telegraph Consulatative Committee (CCITT), the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Office of Telecommunications Policy/Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (OTP/IRAC)."
"The probability of error of the optimal decoder, based on the criterion of minimizing bit-error rate, is calculated for a Markov source imbedded in additive Gaussian noise for several specific cases. The tradeoff between bit-error rate and complexity of a simplified decoder is presented for various signal-to-noise ratios and Markov dependency."
"The solutions to stochastic first- and second-order phaselock loop differential equations are studied in the sense of the calculus of Itô and Stratonovich. The solutions are found to be both theoretically and experimentally invariant to the calculus used. From numerical experimentation it was also discovered that the covergence properties of Euler's integration method was superior to that of Runge-Kutta-Gill."
"The use of polarity coincidence correlation techniques can allow efficient use of digital logic elements for binary differential phase-shift-key demodulation. For the case of sinusoidal signals in the presence of additive Gaussian noise it is shown that an ideal hard limiter at the input to the demodulator adds no degradation to the bit error rate performance."
"The braided coaxial cable is studied as a communication scheme in a mine tunnel. A simplified rectangular waveguide model is adopted for the tunnel, and the shield of the cable is assumed to behave as a single inductive transfer impedance. Specific results on the attenuation of the monofilar and bifilar (or coaxial) modes of propagation, taking into account the possible existence of a thin lossy film on the cable, are presented. In order to estimate the maximum possible range of communication, we consider the coupling factors of these modes to transmitting and receiving dipoles inside the tunnel, and we present results on these factors for various cable parameters and over a wide range of frequencies."
"The main idea of this concise paper is to use symbol reliability information for improving the performance of error detectors. A class of soft decision error detectors (SDED's) is presented, where low weight error patterns are selectively corrected. The reliability numbers govern which error pattern to correct. Asymptotic performance and bounds are derived for the Gaussian channel. It is shown that singleerror correcting SDED's without thresholds have an exponentially lower repeat request probability than the hard decision error detector, but the same exponent in the probability of undetected errors. Detectors with thresholds are also considered. In this case it is possible to contruct an error detector with both better probability of undetected errors and better probability of repeat request than for the hard decision error detector (HDED). Bounds and computer simulations are presented and SDED's are compared to HDED's."
"A multiple scattering model is used and extended to characterize the channel between underwater and airborne (satellite) terminals at optical frequencies. The effects of the air/sea interface are also included with approximate solutions accurate for elevation angles above 45°. The results are presented in terms of a radiance function which is related to the transform of the spatial covariance function (mutual coherence function). The primary losses are shown to be a result of the water absorption coeffecient and not the extinction coefficient. The scattering losses can be isolated from the absorption losses and for certain cases, where the receiver is imbedded in the scattering medium, can be completely recovered. New components may be required to achieve this performance. The effects of ocean roughness are shown to have a minimal effect upon the subsurface reception while causing possible beam steering of subsurface transmission. Although substantial losses are experienced, duplex operation can be achieved at modest data rates."
"Part II presents a unified code-generation algorithm which contains new codes with rates from 14/15 to 49/50. For use with this class of codes, some simplifications of the weighted maximum likelihood decoding are suggested. An approximated error probability expression is set forth for using these codes in communications satellite channels, The measured results are remarkably close to the error rate calculations."
"An inherent capability of packet-switched networks is the speed at which they can be reconfigured; various dynamic or adaptive routing techniques have been conceived to exploit this capability. In this study, existing techniques are described and an \"ultra-dynamic\" technique, delta routing, is invented. Several promising techniques are then selected for comparison with one another and with a network's ultimate carrying capacity. The goal is to shed light on the questions if and when one should use which kind of adaptive routing. First, a taxonomy of routing strategies is presented. In addition to delta routing, random, proportional, shortest path, and shortest path fixed-for-session duration are selected for comparison and their mechanisms described. The delay and efficiency performance of the five techniques are then compared with one another and with ideal behavior via simulations. These have been carried out concentrating on four very small networks, each with very different characteristics with the intention of gaining insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the various techniques. A ten-node network has also been simulated. The results favor delta routing which is most effective in highly interconnected network enviroments."

 "Signals in a satellite-earth communication link pass through the ionosphere where there may exist random irregularities. These random irregularities will scatter and distort the Signal, producing a fading channel. Such a channel is generally characterized by the symmetric and asymmetric correlation functions. Approximate solutions for these functions have been obtained and the results plotted for typical ionospheric parameters. Some of the results are shown in terms of coherence bandwidth."
"Future communications satellites can be expected to employ multibeam antennas for both receiving (uplink) and transmitting (downlink). The use of multibeam satellite transmitting antennas raises the question of how to assign the transmitted power and antenna gain to each of theNbeams such that optimum use is made of satellite resources. We refer to this problem as the downlink allocation problem; it is part of the larger problem of allocating all satellite network variables. This concise paper deals with both problems. Specifically, we rigorously formulate and solve the downlink problem for an arbitrary number of beams using the Lagrange multiplier technique for constrained extremal problems. We then discuss procedures for incorporating the optimum downlink allocation results into a complete system allocation."
"We describe and experimentally evaluate a receiver structure for two-dimensional data communication systems based on passband decision feedback equalization and data-directed carrier recovery. The forward and feedback tap coefficients and the demodulator's carrier phase angle are adjusted adaptively; the carrier recovery and demodulation operation, as in the case of a linear equalization receiver, can compensate for rather severe frequency offset and phase jitter. Experimental results are reported of simulations of the receiver on voiceband telephone channels."
"This concise paper deals with variable length source coding for binary memoryless sources with a fidelity criterion. The encoding scheme under consideration is an (M_{c}, N, K) code consisting of a distortionless run-length inner code of size Mcand an outer code that maps each source vector of lengthNto a codeword of length less than or equal toK. The encoding of the outer code is accomplished by means of a trellis search, and the distortion measure used is a Hamming distance. For composite binary memoryless sources an adaptive (M_{c}, N) code can be constructed by varying the constraintKon codeword length according to the source statistics. The (M_{c}, N, K), and (M_{c}, N) codes are insensitive to the inaccuracy in estimating the source probabilities. Rate-distortion curves, obtained by computer simulation, are plotted along with the theoretical rate-distortion functionR(D)."
"A 15-electrode totally implanted time-multiplex telemetry unit is described that is powered by two mercury cells in series. Transcutaneous radio frequency (RF) turn-on and magnetic turnoff are used to conserve battery power. The basic cycle rate is 400 Hz, channel rate 6400 Hz. The channel 16 input consists of a 200-Hz 5 mV peak-to-peak (p-p) reference signal, and a 3200-Hz sync signal is added to all channels. The unit is1.5 \\times 2.5 \\times 8cm in size, weighs 41 g, and draws 3.5 mA. Low-frequency cutoff is at 0.2 Hz. The output is FM with a peak deviation of 75 kHz of a 20 MHz carrier at 5 mV peak channel input. The equivalent noise input is 2.8 μV root mean square (rms). The decoder automatically locks on the reference signal square wave with the aid of an exclusive-OR gate."
"This paper presents data and criteria to assess and guide the design of modems for coded noncoherent communication systems subject to practical system constraints of powerS, bandwidthW, noise spectral density N0, coherence time Tc, and number of orthogonal signalsM. Three basic receiver types are analyzed for the noncoherent multifrequency-shift keying (MFSK) additive white Gaussian noise channel: hard decision, unquantized (optimum), and quantized (soft decision). Channel capacity and computational cutoff rate Rcompare computed for each type and presented as functions of the predetection signal-to-noise ratioST/N_{0}and the number of orthogonal signalsM = 2TW. This relates the channel constraints of power, bandwidth, coherence time, and noise power to the optimum choice of signal durationT \\leq T_{c}and signal numberM."
"Based on the premise that flexibility is a primary objective for future data networks, it is proposed to integrate circuit switching (CS) and packet switching (PS) in a single network. This paper addresses the switching node in such a network. A novel node concept is presented, imposing PS on a CS structure. Connection management and node control functions on the one hand and packet processing/storing on the other are performed by two groups of modules. The modularity requirement leads to very small, simple processors built into storage modules for packet handling. Considering the high throughput requirement of about 1200 packets/s/node, configurations may exceed 30 packet-handling modules. The wellknown saturation effect of multiprocessor systems, i.e., decreasing incremental throughput with increasing number of processor modules, is overcome by a new concept of intermodule communications, taking advantage of the particular data-communications environment. Intermodule communications-and therefore overhead-have been significantly reduced. As a result, systems throughput for fixed processor module utilization is nearly a linear function of the number of modules, the deviation from linearity being less than 10 percent over the range considered."
"Technical applications of binary pseudonoise (PN) sequences frequently utilize correlation procedures. At the output of the post-detection integrator of one form of the correlation circuit, which is often used to obtain initial synchronization of PN spread-spectrum communications systems, parasitic voltage peaks may appear which are not evident from the basic theory of pseudorandom sequences. The origin of these parasitic peaks is explained by the help of the shift-and-add property of binary pseudorandom sequences. Besides, a procedure is given for the approximate calculation of the amplitude of the parasitic peaks."
"This paper shows that, under certain weak restrictions, a two-dimensional discrete Markov process can be represented either \"causally\" by a one-sided difference equation, or \"noncausally\" by a multiple-sided difference equation. The former representation is pertinent to the analysis of image coders and processors that operate sequentially on scanned image data. The latter representation is applicable to the analysis of block coders and processors. The general relation between the two representations is given and the specialized forms resulting under separable scene covariance studied."
"As a powerful tool for economizing on the digital transmission of videotelephone signals, interframe coding techniques have drawn increasing attention, and various interframe coding schemes have been proposed recently. However, many problems remain to be studied in establishing technical feasibility for these techniques and schemes. This concise paper reports on field trial in which a 1.544-Mbits/s digital transmission of videotelephone signals was conducted over Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation's (NTT's) PCM100M digital repeatered line between Tokyo and Yokohama, Japan. The experimental interframe codec is based on the well-understood conditional picture element replenishment algorithm. The object of the field trial was to demonstrate, not the validity of the algorithm itself, but the technical feasibility of the interframe coding system as an entity. Experimental results are satisfactory enough to assure us of the system's practicality in the near future."
"Intermittent data transmission, that is, sending data only when the signal strength is above a desired threshold, has been shown to be extremely effective at combatting the effects of signal fading. However, such a system must usually interface with a uniform data source and sink by the use of finite buffers. When the buffer fills, transmission must occur during bad signal conditions and when it empties, no transmission can occur. The effect of such a finite buffer on system performance is derived and these theoretical results are validated using computer simulation. Finally, adaptive methods to improve performance are investigated and two areas of application of an intermittent System are examined."
"A wide-band inverse-sine phase modulator is demonstrated. The modulator has application in a LINC amplifier for linear amplification at microwave frequencies using commonly available saturating amplifiers or injection-locked oscillators. A bandwidth greater than 10 MHz at a carrier frequency of 96 MHz with distortion products 40 dB or greater below desired components has been shown. The distortion behavior as a second-order effect of the loop delay as predicted by analysis has been verified. The output of the inverse-sine phase modulator and its conjugate, generated by a second phase modulator, were subtracted as in a LINC amplifier, to provide at least 40-dB suppression of the zeroth order and even-order components."
"Cost-effective design of networks linking many remote terminals to a central computer (CPU) involves use of low-speed data lines to link geographically close terminals to concentrators. The concentrators are connected via high-speed data lines to the CPU. A design algorithm based on clustering of terminals followed by optimization of location, capacity and number of concentrators in each cluster is developed and evaluated. Evaluation is based on network designs for sets of 20 randomly (uniformly) generated locations of up to 500 terminals, with specific (realistic) cost versus capacity schedules being used for data lines and concentrators. In comparison with the popular Add algorithm, our linear regression clustering (LRC) algorithm has the following advantages: 1) the total cost of the concentrators, low-speed terminal lines, and high-speed CPU lines is typically 8 percent less; 2) the average transmission time delay at the terminals is typically 40 percent less; 3) the cost of adding low-speed data lines to connect additional terminals to concentrators in existing networks is typically 50 percent less; 4) the computational cost of design is typically 20 times less for 100-terminal networks and 150 times less for 500-terminals networks. Implications of the results and suggestions for further work are discussed."
"The eye impairment of the detected signal is derived for the non-band-limited and a band-limited case. The results of the bandlimited case and a typical system are illustrated. It is noted that these results demonstrate the possibility of echo suppression with wideband frequency modulation."
"In processing video-telephone signals to reduce bandwidth requirements, lines may occasionally be lost due to buffer overflow or DPCM channel errors. The subjective degradation introduced by replacing deleted lines by averaging or repeating adjacent lines (substitution) has been measured. In the test, both skilled and unskilled observers were asked to add white noise to an unimpaired picture until the quality was equal to the same picture in which a number of lines had been randomly substituted. It was found that the more critical skilled observers deemed a picture, degraded by substituting 1 averaged line per frame, comparable to a signal-to-noise ratio of 38.6 dB, a rating of \"definitely noticeable but not objectionable\" on a 5-point impairment scale. Futhermore, it was found that repeating lines rather than averaging produced more degradation, equivalent to a 4 dB lower signal-to-noise ratio."
"A good deal of effort has been spent, in the past few years, to devise numerical algorithms for evaluating the performance of digital communication systems over noisy linear channels, i.e., in the presence of intersymbol interference and noise. In this concise paper we present a method for computing the error probability of multilevel baseband digital modulation systems when the channel is nonlinear with memory. The algorithm is based on a Volterra series expansion of the nonlinearity; with this model, we show that the moments of the disturbance can be computed recursively, and the same techniques in use for linear channels can be applied for evaluating the error probability. This approach can be generalized to consider noise entering the nonlinear channel. The computing algorithms are described in detail, and a complete example is worked out."
"We consider the design and implementation of a lownoise feedback receive amplifier for use in optical communication systems. The feedback amplifier configuration is advantageous in that it offers a wide bandwidth with good signal to noise ratio."
"This paper presents an algorithmic method for measuring the instantaneous frequency of a uniformly sampled FM signal. The measured parameter, termed digital instantaneous frequency, is defined in a manner similar to that used to describe frequency-modulated, continuous-time signals. The measurements are derived from an adaptive linear prediction spectral estimates. The proposed algorithm is utilized in the development of a digital processor for FM demodulation which operates on a uniformly sampled FM signal, and its output is a sampled sequence of the estimated demodulated message. The performance of the digital processor is demonstrated and compared with that of a conventional FM discriminator."
"AnM-ary, large time-bandwidth product signal design technique is described which is useful for signaling in channels characterized by narrow-band interference and/or wide-band noise impulses. Diversity is also provided, thereby making it a useful signaling technique for dispersive channels. The motivations for choosing this signal format are explained, and design procedures, with two candidate signal designs, are given. The performance of a fast-fast-Fourier-transform-based receiver, which employs an excision algorithm for reducing the effects of narrow-band interference, is investigated through computer simulation."
"The application of QAM receivers employing passband decision feedback equalization or Viterbi algorithm detection is considered for high-speed data transmission in voiceband telephone channels. Analytical results for the Viterbi receiver indicate that it can permit digital data transmission with symbol rates exceeding the nominal bandwidth capabilities of the channel. However, it is also shown that the minimum distance of partial response-type impulse responses can substantially decrease due to small demodulation phase errors. Thus, decision feedback receivers may offer more robust performance on channels with phase jitter."
"Real-time processing of video waveforms has been implemented for the purpose of analyzing image dynamics. A digital preprocessor yields data sets that describe the difference between selected fields of an input video signal in both the spatial and temporal domains. Further reduction and analysis of the acquired data can provide several measures of image activity such as the frame-to-frame correlation, the frame-difference signal (FDS), and statistics of scene lengths. The results of a series of measurements of the dynamics of typical broadcast television programs are presented. It is demonstrated that image activity is separable into two distinct classes, one caused by image and camera movement, and the other by scene switches."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The comments of Prof. Delogne on our paper (\"Calculated channel characteristics of a braided coaxial cable in a mine tunnel\") seem very appropriate and instructive. I do agree with Prof. Delogne that at low frequencies, questions related to the receiver noise and perhaps the receiver matching become of primary importance. The coupling loss in the aforementioned paper is actually related only to the mutual impedance between the transmitting and receiving antennas but does not include the input resistances of these antennas. This drawback has been repaired in the paper \"Calculated transmission loss for a leaky feeder communication systems in a circular tunnel\" by Hill and Wait (1976). However, by limiting the antenna input resistance to a certain minimum value at the lower frequencies, the two definitions of the coupling loss in our papers become identical (within a constant). It is interesting to notice that both papers confirm the result that the coupling loss is a very slowly varying function of frequency for frequencies less than about 35 MHz. This is so in spite of the different approaches used in the two papers. Specifically, the coupling loss in Mahmoud and Wait's paper is obtained without assigning any particular location or orientation of the antennas; hence, it can be considered as some kind of average coupling loss over various locations and orientations."
"Summary form only given, as follows. Prof. Delogne has made some very useful and pertinent comments on the subject of this paper. An improved but, alas, a more complicated approach to the coupling losses is contained in a recent paper, \"Calculated transmission loss for a leaky feeder communication system in a circular tunnel,\" by D.A. Hill and J.R. Wait, Radio Sci., vol. 11, pp. 315-321, Apr. 1976."

"A brief literature survey of transversal filters is followed by a design example of a binary transversal filter. A particular application in the modulator of the single channel per carrier data transmission equipment is described. Computer simulations and COS/MOS hardware implementation proved the validity and the feasibility of the theory described by Mueller. Design and evaluation of a linear phase filter approaching the Nyquist channel is the end result of our study."
"We present and analyze a method of interpolation that improves the amplitude resolution of an analog-to-digital converter. The technique requires feedback around a quantizer that operates at high speed and digital accumulation of its quantized values to provide a PCM output. We show that use of appropriate weights in the accumulation has important advantages for providing finer resoution, less spectral distortion, and white quantization noise. The theoretical discussion is supplemented by the report of a practical converter designed especially to show up the strengths and weaknesses of the technique. This converter comprises a sigma-delta modulator operating at 8 MHz and an accumulation of the 1-bit code with triangularly distributed weights. 13-bit resolution at 8 kwords/s is realized by periodically dumping the accumulation to the output. We present a practical method for overcoming a thresholding action that distorts low-amplitude input signals."
"A new upper bound on the error probability for differential phase-shift keyed transmission in the presence of additive Gaussian white noise (AGWN) and peak-limited interference is estimated using numerical techniques. An error probability expression is evaluated for various interference angles and the maximum value found is chosen as the upper bound. A simple approximation is presented and found to be close to the upper bound. This upper bound is shown to be a realistic bound, hence it could be useful for practical design purposes."
"A method of designing sequences with specified autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties is presented in this paper. This is based on power residue classification of a prime or a prime power and consists of first finding periodic sequences with acceptable correlation sidelobes and then testing these for aperiodic correlation. Signals considered include binary, polyphase, and frequency-time coded sequences. Computer results for some short length sequences are also given."
"An expression is derived for the mean-square error of an SSBAM multilevel class 4 partial response data signal when distorted by a channel with parabolic group delay with the minimum value centered in the signal spectrum. The optimum carrier phase and sampling times are also determined. Numerically evaluated results indicate that the approximation errors made in the derivation are not significant in the regions of practical interest."
"This concise paper presents a theoretical evaluation of energy packing of the Hadamard transform which is often used in signal processing. It is shown that energy contained in the lowest1/2^{j}(j: positive integer) of a signal's sequency spectrum can be explicitly evaluated in terms of covariances of the signal."
"The problem of acknowledgment schemes in store-and-forward packet-switching communication networks is addressed. The performance of systems with end-to-end acknowledgment (ETE Ack) and hop-by-hop acknowledgment (HBH Ack) are compared in terms of packet delay and channel utilization. It is shown that a system with an HBH Ack scheme performs significantly better in terms of delay or channel utilization, when the number of hops that a packet traverses is large and/or when the probability of successful packet transmission over the channel is low."
"Causal, minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators of a Gauss-Markov process observed through a conditional Poisson process whose rate parameter is a linear function of the estimation error are presented. Although the conditional estimation performance is data dependent, precomputable upper bounds on the average estimation performance are obtained. Approximate expressions are also presented for the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and it is shown that the estimator performance achieves that bound with equality when the estimator is operating considerably \"above threshold.\" The estimator structure is applied to the problem of phase-tracking receivers for optical communication. Two receiver structures that use predetector phase feedback are considered: one uses local reference fields to allow the detector to observe phase error (homodyne/heterodyne), while the other is a novel direct detection receiver that depends explicitly on the closed-loop nature of the phase estimator. It is concluded that a large local oscillator amplitude is desirable to improve the phase-tracking performance in the homodyne/heterodyne case, and that as few as 4/8 detected signal photons per phase coherence time are required to keep the estimator above threshold. The direct detection scheme achieves the same performance as the homodyne system only in the limit of no dark current-background noise counts, and in general may require considerably more signal photons to keep the estimator \"locked.\""
"Construction methods for digital video networks which transmit various kinds of information signals are studied. It is pointed out that, in order to construct the actual video networks, such problems appear as the introductory process or changing process of the networks. Network flexibility, transparency, and cost performance are major requirements to consider, especially for video networks. To resolve these problems, three important items, i.e., codec arrangements, selective control of analog-digital circuits, and multiplexing with group switching, are taken up and examined. Several systems comprising new proposals are analyzed and compared with one another."
"This paper describes experimental results of simulated 12000 and 14400 bits/s quadrature amplitude-modulated (QAM) systems (which were described in detail in Part I [1] ) operating on real and simulated voiceband channels. These experimental results show that both Viterbi algorithm detection and decision feedback equalization allow digital data transmission at symbol rates exceeding the nominal bandwidth capabilities of typical telephone channels. It is demonstrated in these experiments that the Viterbi algorithm receiver structure tested is less affected by linear distortion than the decision feedback receiver but exhibits greater sensitivity to phase jitter. On conditioned voiceband channels where there may be substantial phase jitter, a reasonable compromise between sensitivity to distortion and noise and sensitivity to phase jitter is made by a modem employing decision feedback equalization and decision-directed carrier phase tracking."

"In this paper, the optimal analog repeater system which transmits maximum mutual information (MI-system) is discussed. The solution is obtained by conventional variational method and the functional structure of the resulting optimal system is investigated. The system consists of a whitening filter, an \"equivalent cable,\" and a \"system equalizer,\" the concepts of which are newly introduced and defined in the paper. For comparison, the repeater system with minimum mean-square error (ME-system) is analyzed by the analogous method. It is shown that the whitening filter and the \"equivalent cable\" are invariant for both systems and that the only part which varies with the optimizing criterion is the \"system equalizer.\" Finally, these results are applied to the special case of single stage and the relation to Shannon's water pouring theorem is discussed."
"In the last decade the work on linear tapped delay line equalizers has proved successful in reducing intersymbol interferenceone of the largest problems in data communication systems. An adjoining problem is the selection of a sampling time reference. An equalizer structure less sensitive to sampling time reference is studied for adaptive equalization. The equalization is simply done by means of tap coefficient adjustment. The equalizer consists of two parallel branches, each containing a transversal filter with adjustable tap coefficients. The branches are connected by a fixed filter, the transfer function of which is selected such that the equalizer can perform a sampling time reference displacement and a cancellation of intersymbol interference simultaneously. The criterion of goodness is the conventional meansquare error (including noise) between the actual output and a desired output. The equalizer is applied in two examples showing-in contrast to a conventional equalizer with the same total number of tap coefficients-the insensitivity of the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) to how the the sampling time reference is selected. Thus no extra circuits are needed for this purpose, while a mean-square error that is as low as the best that can be obtained with a conventional equalizer is adaptively maintained."
"It is shown that the sensitivity of the performance of least mean-square error (LMS) equalizers to the sampler phase is a function of equalizer length for partial-response systems. An LMS algorithm for the adjustment of sampler phase is derived for partial-response systems. This algorithm does not require the transmission of any pilot tones and is relatively easily implementable by digital circuits. A method of selecting a \"good\" initial sampler phase is also proposed."
"The degree of complexity of a digital signal processor is closely related to the precision with which samples of an incoming analog waveform are represented. There is considerable interest in determining how coarse this representation can be without seriously degrading performance from that of an ideal processor of unquantized samples. This question is examined for a receiver of noisy, linearly distorted pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals. An optimum [maximum likelihood (ML)] detector, analogous to the Viterbi detector for unquantized samples, is derived for the case of a quantized sample sequence. Performance is evaluated under the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the resultant error probability is a good approximation for coarse quantization, and an upper bound for any degree of quantization. For a specified error probability, the degree of quantization suggested by this approach is conservative. Since receiver complexity is closely associated with the length of the digital representation of an input sample, an upper bound on receiver complexity is also suggested. Numerical evaluation of the error probability is quite tedious for an arbitrary channel; however, system performance may be readily evaluated for partial-response (PR) signaling. For the PR channels"
"By factorizing a finite sum of harmonics, an expression is obtained for an FM demodulator output when the modulating signal is a simple sinusoid and the RF filter is an ideal bandpass filter. Using this result, harmonic distortions and the signal-to-distortion ratio are defined and computed; several curves are drawn to show the variation of these quantities in terms of the modulation index and the normalized bandwidth."
"Simulation of requests for service from a large number of low duty cycle independent users is apt to cause a severe computational load. A method is presented for the software implementation of an efficient simulator. It can be applied to the investigation of many time-sharing systems, such as satellite demand assignment (DA), computer time sharing, and traffic routing. More generally, the method generates independent multivariate Poisson distributions when the number of variables is very large and the value of the parameter in each distribution is very small."
"Mutual synchronization between two geographically separated phase-locked oscillators is investigated for two different interconnection methods. This includes the so-called single-ended (uncompensated delay) and the double-ended (compensated delay) methods. Explicit formulas for determining the steady-state frequency and phase errors are developed for both methods. Necessary conditions for the existance of a synchronous state are derived in terms of basic system parameters. Finally, a comparison Of the methods of oscillator interconnection is made as a function of the uncompensated channel delays. Graphical results are presented which are useful in determining steadystate system performance."
 "This paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining the optimal linear vector coding (transformation) method that matches anr-dimensional vector signal and ak-dimensional channel under a given channel power constraint and mean-squared-error criterion. The encoder converts thercorrelated random variables intorindependent random variables and selects at mostkindependent random variables which correspond to theklargest eigenvaiues of the signal covariance matrixQ. The encoder reinserts cross correlation into thekrandom variables in such a way that the largest eigenvalue ofQis assigned to the smallest eigenvalue of the channel noise covariance matrixRand the second largest eigenvalue ofQto the second smallest eigenvalue ofR, etc. When only the total power for allkchannels is prescribed, the optimal individual channel power assignments are obtained in terms of the total power, the eigenvalues ofQ, and the eigenvalues ofR. When the individual channel power limits are constrained byP_{1}, ..., P_{k}andRis a diagonal matrix, the necessary conditions of an inverse eigenvalue problem must be satisfied to optimize the vector signal transmission system. An iterative numerical method has been developed for the case of correlated channel noise."
"A computer simulation study has been performed to evaluate the performance of a variety of digital modulation techniques in transmitting high-rate digital data over a satellite channel. Results are presented showing comparative performance of various techniques in the form of error-rate curves and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation curves."
"Digital transmission over the empty lower baseband of an existing microwave radio system has the advantages of economical and easy construction. A 1.544 Mbit/s PCM-FDM converter (PF-B1) has been developed. Field test results show that the error-rate per bit is less than 10-8over 840 km with 3 basebands."
"This concise paper reports the result of a study leading to the design for a subscriber's loop signaling system in a data switching network. The data switching network is intended to have improved quality and versatility, and be less expensive than the existing data communication systems. Therefore, various requirements are imposed on the subscriber's loop signaling system. The three-level subscriber's loop signaling system described in this concise paper is considered to satisfy these requirements. In this system, signals are defined by three logical states in the subscriber's loop, i.e., +, -, andN. This system is applicable to both asynchronous and synchronous terminals. The data terminal equipment-data circuit terminating equipment (DTEDCE) interface and the subscriber's loop transmission system, suitable for this signaling system, are also described."
"The optimizations of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's) and pulse error rates in fiber optic receivers are investigated in terms of an avalanche photo diode (APD) model in which excess noise factors depend on the avalanche gains. The optimization of SNR results in an analytical solution for the optimum avalanche gain. A numerical example compares the result with those of conventional SNR optimization where excess noise factors do not depend on avalanche gains. Improvements of around 2 dB in the accuracy of the optimum SNR's are expected. It is shown that the optimization of pulse error rates for digital transmissions can not be attained analytically. This problem is solved by the use of approximate representations of excess noise factors. Two approximate representations are illustrated that provide very simple and accurate analytical solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of these approximate solutions."
"A digital circuit suitable for detection of tones in signaling applications is described. The amount of hardware required for the realization of the circuit is shown to be quite small. The circuit may be used for both analog and digital input signals. For analog signals, the necessary A/D conversion becomes very simple. Results of simulations on a digital computer are given that indicate the good performance of the circuit."

"The detection of light signals using photomultipliers is presented in terms of an idealized model in which the received signal consists of a series of pulses of random height with arrival times that are Poisson distributed with an instantaneous rate proportional to transmitted signal intensity. Linear detection, effected through multiplication by locally generated functions followed by integration, is considered. An optimization algorithm based on Chernoff bounds for the error probability is developed. For the standard Poisson regime with constant pulse heights this algorithm derives correctly the logarithmic local functions predicted rigorously for maximum likelihood detection. For random pulse heights the functions resemble smoothly truncated logarithmic functions of the transmitted signal intensities, and the logarithmic singularity for zero values of the signal is either removed or greatly weakened. Calculations for several classes of pulse height distributions show that the degradation in performance caused by pulse height fluctuations can be predicted with fair accuracy from an \"excess noise factor\" defined in terms of the ratio of pulse height variance to the square of its mean."
"A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for digital sequences disturbed by Gaussian noise, intersymbol interference (ISI) and interchannel interference (ICI) is derived. It is shown that the sampled outputs of the multiple matched filter (MMF) form a set of sufficient statistics for estimating the input vector sequence. Two ML vector sequence estimation algorithms are presented. One makes use of the sampled output data of the multiple whitened matched filter and is called the vector Viterbi algorithm. The other one is a modification of the vector Viterbi algorithm and uses directly the sampled output of the MMF. It appears that, under a certain condition, the error performance is asymptotically as good as if both ISI and ICI were absent."
"It is commonly known that, in order to calculate the demodulated noise power of the wanted frequency division multiplexedfrequency modulated (FDM-FM) signal due to interference, the convolution between the power spectra of the wanted FM signal and interference is required to be obtained. This concise paper shows a simple approach to calculate this convolution without direct calculation of the power spectrum of the FDMFM signal when the power spectrum of the interference is given (by measurements or calculation) and the highest and lowest channel frequencies of the baseband signal and rms frequency deviation of the wanted FDM-FM signal are known. Since the calculation of the FDM-FM signal power spectrum is not an easy problem in some cases, this approach makes much simpler an accurate evaluation of the output noise power due to interference."
"A new modem circuit technique is proposed for multilevel signal transmission to utilize frequency bandwidth efficiently in high-speed digital carrier transmission systems. With this technique a multilevel amplitude and phase-keying (APK) signal is generated as the sum of the outputs of two multiphase modulators and is detected by tandem phase demodulators. This \"superposed modem has a simple circuit configuration. It is constructed from phase-shift-keying (PSK) modems. It appears advantageous for realizing high-baud-rate multilevel transmission of severalhundred Megabauds (MBd). Experimental results show the feasibility of a 16-level modem with performance degradation of only about 1 dB from the theoretical predictions."
"Three different ground terminal transmit power control concepts for a Satcom system are examined. The effectiveness of constant satellite power (CSP) sharing among the carriers and adaptive satellite power (ASP) sharing is compared with constant ground terminal transmit power (CTP). It is shown that ASP offers substantial advantages over CSP in combating environmental degradations and that both can increase link availability with respect to the constant power (CTP) case. The effectiveness of the ASP control technique is shown to depend on the interconnectivity of the network if multidestinational carriers are used. The measurements required for system control, as well as their accuracies, are described."
"In this concise paper we describe an efficient scheme for random and burst error checking by a combination of serial parity checking and convolutional interleaving. The framing for interleaved blocks is shown possible by a simple implementation, and the error detection capability is better than other schemes similar in complexity. The proposed scheme has useful applications for digital transmission."
"Power spectra for binary phase-shift keyed (PSK) and frequency-shift keyed (FSK) signals with combined sinusoidal amplitude modulation by the bit rate clock are presented. Such signal formats have application in \"burst\" communication systems wherein reliable bit synchronization is provided with relative receiver simplicity. Effects of the clock amplitude modulation index and phase are considered, and corresponding power spectra are illustrated. Further, effects of the clock parameters on the rate of spectral rolloff are given and compared with those of conventional PSK and FSK spectra."
"This paper proposes a new translation procedure which is based on a jumbogroup constitution for simultaneous multiplex transmission of telephone and videophone signals over a coaxial 60-MHz system and describes transmission characteristics of the C-60M system using the translation procedure. The translation procedure reduces group-delay distortion harmful to video transmission without changing telephone transmission capacity or without degrading telephone transmission characteristics. It is also capable of transmitting either 36 videophone signals with 1 MHz bandwidth or nine videophone signals with 4.3 MHz bandwidth."
"We investigate intermodulation (IM) production due to the thermal heating of coaxial waveguide walls. Two impressed signals are assumed to propagate in a coaxial cable in the TEM mode. The resulting power developed in the IM product is found to depend upon the thermal coefficient of the electrical conductivity of the metal squared, and is inversely proportional to the conductivity itself."
"The problem of transmitting digital data reliably over a Rician channel, which is used to model the aircraft-satellite link, is treated by an integrated coding and modulation design approach. The results presented enable one to show that it is quite possible to achieve robust signaling which is fairly insensitive to the channel's surface scatter parameters, such as scatter path energy and Doppler spreads. These results illustrate that the scatter energy need not limit the effectiveness of transmitting digital data and, in fact, can improve the performance when operating in the region of low direct path SNR's. These concepts are exemplified by performance curves for frequencyshift keying (FSK) and differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) modulation formats combined with efficient channel measurement decoding algorithms. In addition, general analytical results for evaluating the bit error probability for binary and channel measurement decoders are presented."
"A technique is presented for the derivation of approximate average packet time-delay formulas in a packet-switching store-and-forward network. The approximation technique appropriately incorporates arrival and departure packet interferences with the recent queueing results in a noninterfered communication path. Simulation results, for basic flow configurations, show the approximate timedelay function to constitute a very close lower bound over wide range of traffic intensities. The resulting average time-delay approximation when a Poisson assumption is made, is shown to constitute an upper bound. A procedure for approximate network time-delay analysis is then presented."
"J. R. Wait developed an analytical formulation for the fields of an infinite line source above a stratified earth which can be extended to include any number of layers. This formulation is numerically evaluated using Filon's method to give results on the mutual impedance between two long conductors above a stratified earth. To demonstrate the usefulness of this formulation, numerical results are compared to the experimental results of Bowen and Gilkeson in which the mutual impedance was observed in both its reactive and resistive components at Cross Keys, NJ."
"This paper offers an approximate analysis of the chaining operation in a loop system. The system consists of a central processor andNterminals linked by a common communication channel. Chaining refers to the service protocol whereby the channel is assigned in sequence to each of the terminals. Messages from terminals to the central processor are sent as chains of segments. The object of the analysis is to display the relationships between the arrival processes, the channel allocation, and the response of the system."
"The present study is a sequel to the authors' 1972 paper [1] where the output signal-to-noise ratio SNRois obtained for nonadaptive differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) systems with an arbitrary linear predictor operating on noisy digital channels. Important stability constraints for an arbitrary linear predictor are obtained. A complete analytical study of previous line-line-and-sample feedback systems is presented. The SNRoimprovement over previoussample feedback is found to increase from approximately 2.6 dB for error-free channels to 4.1 dB for noisy channels. Optimization of the predictor for noisy channel usage is shown to greatly reduce the sensitivity of SNRoto variations in message and channel parameters, while use of the resulting predictor on error-free channels yields SNRovalues which are almost as good as those obtained when the predictor is optimized for error-free channels. Reduction of the effects of digital channel errors on SNRousing various methods, including periodic or pseudorandom resetting are considered briefly. Hardcopy results from computer-simulated DPCM monochrome image transmission systems corroborate our analytical results."
"The design, fabrication, and experimental evaluation of an exploratory 8.2 W, microwave FM power amplifier for the 4-GHz band are presented. It operates on a frequency divide, amplify, and multiply scheme receiving about 2-4 dBm of FM signal in the 4-GHz band, divides the frequency coherently by two, amplifies the modulated signal to about 10.4 W, and doubles the frequency coherently, yielding about 8.2 W into standard 50-ω 4-GHz load, with an overall efficiency of about 30 percent. Frequency halving is accomplished by a wideband regenerative frequency divider yielding about 1-2 dBm of signal at 1995 MHz. The signal is amplified by commercial class C amplifiers and is restored to the 4-GHz band by a stacked varactor containing two 0.32 ω, 15-pF chips in a coaxial embodiment. This entire ensemble, with a total breakdown of 160 V, serves as a frequency doubler."
"This paper discusses the theory and design of a tactical channel simulator (TCS) built to simulate land-mobile VHF radio links. The instrument is one of the first such units based on the stored channel principle, which permits the actual medium to be recorded and played back. The key application of the TCS simulator is to realistically reproduce field conditions in a laboratory. Tests on the TCS simulator should be in good accord with performance encountered in the field, unlike results obtained in the standard back-to-back tests which ignore effects of the propagation channel. Experimental results show that the evaluation of modem performance must take into account the effects of propagation over the VHF channel, as data tests are measurably affected by channel conditions. The TCS simulator will be particularly useful in the comparative evaluation of various highspeed, high-performance modems now being introduced into the inventory."
"An investigation is made of the performance of quantizers used as source encoders for noise-corrupted signal sources. The developmerit is pertinent to discrete-time, memoryless, signal-signal-sourse-independent noise sources with a given amplitude bound. A functional analysis approach is adopted to formulate the problem and derive the results. The derivations and intermediate results are in terms of an arbitrary quantizer and, consequently, are applicable to any quantizer and allow quantizer performance comparisons in the worstcase corrupting-noise source context. Examples are presented with this type of comparison in mind. These examples instructively illustrate the application of the results as well as file performance of the uniform quantizer and others under their worst-case additive noise conditions."
 "Recent papers have introduced a multiplexing structure for mixing voice and data traffic in an integrated telecommunications system. This structure utilizes a master frame format of a time division statistical multiplex facility. A certain portion of the frame is allocated to voice calls, and data traffic is assigned to the remaining frame capacity. To achieve a high transmission utilization, data are allowed to use any residual voice capacity momentarily available due to statistical variations in the voice traffic. The voice traffic is treated as a loss system and data packets are buffered. In this paper we derive exact analytical expressions for the key system perfomance measures, the probability of loss for voice calls, and the expected waiting time for data packets. Actually, two cases are considered, the one discussed above, called the movable boundary case, and one where the boundary is fixed; i.e., data are not allowed to utilize the residual voice capacity. The computational aspects of calculating actual numbers are discussed in some detail, and results are presented for typical cases."
"When a communication system is used to transmit many short messages, it is important to reduce the amount of control overhead for creation and destruction of logical process-to-process connections and for reliable communication. Different end-to-end control procedures are described, and they are studied with respect to the possibility of losing a message or accepting a duplicate. It is shown (under certain assumptions about the communication network) that all end-to-end protocols either allow for loss of a message or can deliver duplicates of a message."

"Given a demonstrable correlation between telecommunications and industrial development, an interesting underlying question is: How can a telecommunication system be planned to achieve overall industrial development goals? A response could focus on the technical capabilities of a network, on the telecommunication equipment supply arrangements, and on the tariff structure. High telephone density is a technical attribute of primary importance because telecommunications' value for industrial development is that it provides an infrastructure. This value is not realized until a \"critical mass\" of telephone density is achieved. Where demand for telecommunication service substantially exceeds supply, screening criteria can be used to give certain classes of users higher priority in concert with industrial development goals. A second area of importance is the selection of plant technology which involves decisions that will affect technical capabilities of the network for 15-20 years or more; for example, crossbar, and electronic switching systems each possess certain advantages which should be considered in the light of local conditions. A local telecommunication equipment manufacturer is a participant in national industrial development. Efficient production of equipment might be supported by continuous and substantial demand from trading partners within a block such as the Andean Common Market. To reduce a telecommunication company's equipment costs, competitive procurement and negotiated allocation of supply contracts are two methods that are feasible particularly with transmission equipment such as microwave radios and cable. Alternatively, where a favored supplier relationship exists, the telecommunication company could benefit from the support of a research, development and engineering group in assessing its product choices. Tariff structure is a major allocator of telecommunication resources that is controllable by telecommunication planners. Price rationing is a conservative response to unsatisfied demand but does not respond fully to the needs of industrial development. Seeking to achieve a \"critical mass\" of telephone density through subsidized rates would be more responsive. Other tariff structure issues include use of measured versus flat rate local services, selection of criteria for drawing of local calling area boundaries and utilizing local calling area size as a basis for discrimination in rates. In response to inflation, continual modification of tariff structure is more sensitive to the needs of industrial development than the indexing of the rates, although the latter option requires fewer analytical resources."
"A multipoint private line (MPL) network is designed to operate within specified system-performance objectives. Performance objectives for some types of computer-communications networks are stated in terms of access-delay statistics which measure the grade of service experienced by the stations bidding for access to the private line. Access delay is defined to be the time from when a message reaches the head of its queue at the station-and no message from its queue is being processed-until transmission of the message begins. Using simulation and some analysis, we examine and compare the access delay statistics for an MPL circuit under each of four possible service disciplines for the stations on the circuit. The results in this paper have proven useful in designing certain types of MPL networks for a variety of system parameters."
"The advantages with regard to noise enhancement of certain suboptimum nonlinear techniques for \"equalization\" of linear distortion on channels used for digital data transmission have recently received considerable attention. These nonlinear schemes fall into two classes: decision feedback and nonlinear precoding. Yet each of these methods has an associated peculiarity which has impeded attempts to give firm bounds on performance. Thus, for decision feedback error propagation has caused the analytical pains, while for nonlinear precoding of anL-level alphabet the unknown increase in transmitter power has been culpable. The former problem has recently received successful attention by one of the present authors and some colleagues. Here we address the concomitant problem for nonlinear precoding and its extension to quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and show that the transmitted normalized powerPsatisfies(L^{2} - 1)/3 \\leq P \\leq (L^{2} - 1)/3 + 1."
"A historical perspective on the development of telecommunications in Latin America in the last decade is evolved in this introductory paper. The current national telecommunication situation is then considered with reference to three countries-Honduras, Colombia, and Brazil-with emphasis on planning and future programs. Because of the accelerating impact that satellite communication has had on Latin American telecommunications development, international, intercontinental, domestic, and regional satellite communication operation and plans are treated. Finally, some broad-gauge objectives for development and integration of Latin American telecommunications to provide economic growth and social and cultural benefits are presented."
"Over the last decade, Latin American telecommunications authorities have shown a growing concern for rural services reflecting their governments' increasing interest in this subject in the context of social and economic development. This paper presents a broad review of the existing situation of rural telecommunications in Latin America; details, though interesting in some cases, are not included except when necessary for the interpretation of the general problem. Rural communications, as reported here, refers only to telephony and telegraphy; other services, especially radio and television broadcasting, are not considered although they can be related to rural programs."
 "The discrete complex Kalman filter is considered as an equalizer for quadrature phase-shift keyed (QPSK) systems in the presence of additive noise and intersymbol interference (ISI). When the channel is unknown, an adaptive Kalman equalizer is used in which the channel complex tap gains are estimated by decision feedback."
"To study the performance of a full-duplex messageswitched computer network, called TIDAS-T, during various conditions a simulation model has been built in order to simulate the procedure. The model describes the communication and the line procedure in the TIDAS network very closely. The only simplification made is that the processing time in the node computers is disregarded as being insignificant in comparison with the transmission and queueing times. The model, programmed in SIMSCRIPT 1.5, is very flexible because all important parameters are given by input data. The outputs from a simulation differ from run to run due to the object defined by input data parameters. The statistical results are mostly presented as complete statistical distributions. It has turned out that the model has been a splendid tool in order to study and view the consequences of different design approaches. Some of the problems in building such a complex model axe elucidated and some simulation runs are given as illustrations. As the model is very flexible it may be used to study computer networks other than TIDAS."
"The minimum (frequency) shift keying (MSK) format is generalized to enable further improvements in the spectrum while retaining the well-known constant envelope property and the excellent communications efficiency of MSK. A specific alternative to MSK is presented, and the spectrum is compared with that of MSK. The theoretical limitations on possible further spectrum improvements are discussed."
"The main differences between the problems of telecommunications training in Latin America and those in well industrialized countries are stated, the solution through national training centers is briefly described, and the need and possibility of regional training centers serving several countries is discussed and illustrated with relevant information about Venezuela's Telecommunication Studies Center."
"The measurement and tracking of the delay between two versions of a stochastic signal by cross-correlation techniques is considered. Such techniques have broad applications, e.g., interferometry, noncontact speed and distance measurement, etc. The paper begins by discussing the functional diagram of the tracking system. From this diagram a mathematically equivalent model of the system is derived and its similarities to the well known baseband model of the phase-locked loop are discussed. Using Fokker-Planck (F-P) techniques the performance of the system, as a function of fundamental system parameters, is computed and graphically illustrated. These results are then compared with experimental results obtained by computer simulation."
"The multipath channel for communication between an aerospace vehicle and a ground terminal is modeled by a multiplicative first-order Markov process. The multiplicative process is treated as a component of the message model and the discrete-time demodulation algorithms using the extended Kalman nonlinear estimation technique are developed for continuous-time angle-modulated signals. The equivalent baseband form of the demodulator structure is derived. Two examples of the message process are discussed for an FM system. The simulation results are presented for various values of the bandwidth expansion ratio and the additive SNR. The performance of the baseband algorithms is discussed."
"The problem of communicating binary information from ground to aircraft viaL-band aeronautical satellite channels is addressed, with particular attention given to the effect of and means of combating diffuse-scattered multipath interference. Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) is considered throughout. Test results of a recent flight-test program are summarized and compared to theory for uncoded DPSK. We then discuss and evaluate the use of diffuse convolutional codes in conjunction with threshold decoding to improve error probability on the fading channel. Simulation has shown that a power saving of 8 dB may be gained at 10-5error rate for typical channel conditions with very little complexity."
"A discrete-time system of infinite-capacity buffers in tandem is studied. The input process to the first buffer consists of individual arrivals characterized by a geometric distribution of the time between arrivals; and the probability that the output channel of each buffer, except the last, is transmitting at any epoch depends only on the number of digits in the buffer at that epoch. The transmitting state of the last buffer may depend more generally on the history of that buffer. The analysis shows that in equilibrium, the input processes to the subsequent buffers in the system are geometric with the same parameter as the input process to the first buffer. Therefore, each buffer in the system can be analyzed separately. Furthermore, the equilibrium state probabilities for a given buffer at a given epoch are independent of those for any other buffer in the system at the same epoch."
"This paper is based on a study made by the author in 1972-1973. The cost information corresponds to 1970. Although wealth and population density vary somewhat between Latin American countries, the region can be considered, as a group, better off than the other underdeveloped regions of the world. The network studied is probably among the best in the region. The paper is addressed to the issue of service-related cost allocation in the actual telephone network of Costa Pica. Although it is theoretically impossible to determine univocally average costs for the different services (due to joint costs), computations are made on the basis of hopefully reasonable assumptions. Marginal costs can be computed univocally, and are computed for long distance links on a dynamic framework, and for urban networks on a comparative-statics framework. Pricing policies are a natural outcome of this study. However, the only price structure that can be computed using only the information included is efficient pricing. Efficient pricing under financial or other constraints requires an understanding of consumer behavior. Among the findings worth mentioning is the interdependence of the cost structure and technological changes. Examples of this are the lesser importance of holding time in common control exchanges vis-à-vis step-by-step, the lesser importance of distance in long-distance traffic in mircowave links vis-à-vis physical pairs. The notable disparity between cost and rates in modern longdistance links, resulting in cross-subsidization from long-distance to urban networks, is a very important issue in most telephone networks."
"The electricity demand forecast can be used profitably, either as a short-cut or as a long-term effort, in telephone demand forecasting. Preliminary application of such effort to two Latin American countries offers fruitful insight and results. Further research in this area may pave the way to useful collaboration between planners in energy and telecommunications development projects."

 "The problem of tracking a target in a multitarget environment when the observations are received over a fading channel is considered. The optimal Bayes solution to the tracking problem in such cases involves growing memory and hence is not feasible. A particularly effective suboptimal scheme uses a probabilistic judgment at each stage of the observations to overcome this problem. This concise paper presents an evaluation of the scheme in terms of mean-square error performance when the observations are received over fading channels."
"This concise paper demonstrates the decoding of BCH codes by using a multisequence linear feedback shift register (MLFSR) synthesis algorithm. The algorithm is investigated and developed. With this algorithm, a class of good codes has been found with errorcorrecting capability at least as good as the BCH bound. The application of this algorithm to BCH decoding is discussed."
"An experimental repeater for amplification and regeneration of 50 Mb/s fiber-optical pulses has been built and tested. For the receiver either Si p-i-n or avalanche photodiodes are used in conjunction with a high impedance FET input amplifier. The high voltage for the avalanche photodiode is generated internally and controlled by the received signal. This AGC circuit is capable of compensating for temperature changes of the avalanche gain over the range of-40 - +60\\degC. The optical transmitter consists of either a GaAs light emitting diode or a GaA1As laser diode coupled to optical fibers and directly modulated by a current driver with 30 percent electrical efficiency. For 10-9error rate, the required average optical signal power for a pseudorandom signal is p-i-n diode: -41.5 dBm; avalanche diode: -56.6 dBm. The optical output power into a fiber with 1 percent index difference is LED: -17 dBm; GaAlAs laser: 0 dBm. The repeater power requirement is about 2 W."
"The numerical techniques of transform image coding are well known in the image bandwidth compression literature. This concise paper presents a new transform method in which the singular values and singular vectors of an image are computed and transmitted instead of transform coefficients. The singular value decomposition (SVD) method is known to be the deterministically optimal transform for energy compaction [2]. A systems implementation is hypothesized, and a variety of coding strategies is developed. Statistical properties of the SVD are discussed and a self adaptive set of experimental results is presented, Imagery compressed to 1, 1.5, and 2.5 bits per pixel with less than 1.6, 1, and 1/3 percent, respective mean-square error is displayed. Finally, additional image coding scenarios are postulated for further consideration."
"Various algorithms have been proposed for determining the routing paths designed to minimize the average overall message time delay in message-switched networks. In this paper we describe the application of the gradient projection algorithm to this problem. This algorithm is a gradient-type search procedure designed to handle constrained optimization problems, into which category the routing problem falls. Calculations of the computational complexity of this algorithm indicate that it is particularly well-suited to networks with a limited number of commodities or source-destination pairs. The algorithm is applied to a representative group of distributed-type networks, of varying complexity. Execution times for this algorithm are compared with those obtained using the flow deviation routing algorithm. These agree roughly with the results of the computational requirement calculations; i.e., this algorithm generally requires less execution time for networks with a relatively small number of commodities than does the flow deviation method. (The actual running time depends significantly on the choice of the initial flows or routing paths, however.) For those networks in which all network nodes may be expected to communicate with all other nodes, however, the flow deviation method would be expected to be superior."
"For phase-shift keying (PSK) systems a method has been presented to determine the filter parameters so that the degradation produced by the bandlimiting filters is tolerable and as many channels as possible can be accommodated in a given RF band. Thermal noise present in the system and intersymbol and interchannel interference are considered the major sources of impairment in the system, and these are the only sources of impairment considered in this paper. The method is here applied to a binary coherent PSK (CPSK) system when unequalized Butterworth and Chebyshev filters of different complexities are used as receiving filters, and suitable filter parameters have been determined."
"In this concise paper we present a method to estimate the performance of wide-band 15-GHz microwave line-of-sight communication links as a function of precipitation statistics, given specific fade margins derived from equipment and path parameters. The method is based on the use of theoretical or measured rain attenuation rates, statistics of surface point rainfall rates, and relations between point and path-average rainfall rates derived from measurements in Florida. Results in terms of total path attenuation or maximum usable path lengths for given performance criteria can vary widely depending on the data base used; they are particularly sensitive to the attenuation rate model used and to the rain climate. As a practical matter, the analysis shows that path lengths up to about 30 km for line-line-of-sight links (with adequate terrain clearance) may be usable in climates characterized by moderate rainfall amounts (such as central Europe) even if relatively pessimistic assumptions are made regarding rain attenuation rates."
"The technology advances made in the development of an engineering feasibility model of a Nd:YAG laser communication system for space test are discussed and details of evaulations presented. The model includes the baseplate, optomechanical structure, 19-cm (7.5-in) diameter telescope and prototype space qualifiable components. The main technological achievements are in the areas of laser and its operation, the modulator and the digital format, and the integration of the various optical components into one optomechanical structure. These as well as other technology advances will be discussed and the system performance capabilities indicated."
"Some new optical pulse formats are investigated for solving practical problems in fiber optic communication systems. These pulse formats provide many advantageous features such as error monitoring capability, abundant timing information, uniform optical power utilization, stable detection of optical input, and so forth. It is shown that a modification of Personick's receiver design theory can be used for comparison of various optical pulse formats. The comparison suggests that for state-of-the-art fiber systems with moderate fiber loss and moderate repeater spacing, where no pulse equalization is required, some new classes of 1 binary digit converted to 2 binary digits (1B2B) or 2B3B formats will permit the realization of very simple and reliable repeaters for fiber optic digital transmission. A future low-loss fiber system may permit a very long repeater spacing with the help of equalization. In this case, application of the correlative signal-processing technique is shown to be very promising. Experimental 6.3 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s transmissions demonstrate some advantageous features of these optical pulse formats."
"Digital filters and signal processors when realized in hardware often use serial transfer of data. Multipliers which are capable of accepting variable coefficients and data in sign and magnitude notation and producing serial products of the same length as the input data word have been known for some time. This concise paper addresses the design of multipliers capable of accepting data in 2's complement notation, or both data and coefficients in 2's complement notation. It also considers multiplier recoding techniques, such as the Booth algorithm. Specialized (fixed coefficient) multiplier designs are considered briefly. Finally, multiplier rounding and overflow characteristics are discussed, and a rough comparison is made between the complexity of the various designs."
"The relationship between the column distance function and the computational effort of sequential decoding is studied and the results of computer simulations are reported. A table ofR = 1/2codes having good free distance and optimum average column distance function (CDF) is presented."
"By the simple expedient of dividing users into two groups-one transmitting at high power and the other at low powerthe maximum utilization of a slotted ALOHA communication system can be increased from 36.8 percent to about 53 percent. Similar comments apply to the unslotted ALOHA case. An extension to more than two power groups also is described."
"On most real channels hybrid error control schemes are expected to provide a throughput higher than that of automatic repeatrequest (ARQ) systems and a reliability better than forward error correction (FEC) systems. On compound channels, channels with a mixture of random and burst errors, generalized burst-trapping (GBT) codes seem to be quite effective for FEC. In this paper, a hybrid scheme with Go BackNARQ as the retransmission component and GBT code as the FEC component, is described. Its performance is analyzed in terms of throughput efficiency and undetected error probability and is compared with that of a forward-acting GBT code. Numerical calculations of the parameters are presented to illustrate the performance."
 "Previous analytic models for packet switching networks have always assumed infinite storage capacity in store-store-and-forward (S/F) nodes. In this paper, we relax this assumption and present a model for a packet switching network in which each node has a finite pool of S/F buffers. A packet arriving at a node in which all S/F buffers are temporarily filled is discarded. The channel transmission control mechanisms of positive acknowledgment and time-out of packets are included in this model. Individual S/F nodes are analyzed separately as queueing networks with different classes of packets. The single node results are interfaced by imposing a continuity of flow constraint. A heuristic algorithm for determining a balanced assignment of nodal S/F buffer capacities is proposed. Numerical results for the performance of a 19 node network are illustrated."

"An analytical approach is developed to investigate the performance of coherent phase-shift keying (CPSK) systems transmitted through a nonlinear satellite transponder. A novel quadrature model of the satellite nonlinearity is introduced, and is found to yield an excellent fit to the actual traveling wave tube (TWT) characteristics as commonly used in a satellite transponder, with the advantage of requiring the choosing of only a few parameter values. Based on this quadrature model an expression for the bit error rate is derived in the form of an infinite series where the leading term corresponds to the error-rate for a linear channel and the remaining terms are correction terms accounting for nonlinear effects. The performance of a binary PSK system is computed and presented as a function of the up-link and down-link carrier-to-noise-power ratios (CNR) and a bandwidth spread factor."
"This paper addresses itself to some comparisons of adaptive routing algorithms in store-and-forward Communication nets. The intent here is to demonstrate how some relatively simple add-ons to already existing adaptive algorithms can decrease the average message delay and increase message throughput in the network. The overview of many existing routing algorithms is intended to point out that, although an algorithm may be adaptive, it is not necessarily good in terms of the performance measures addressed in this paper. The basic objective of this study is to assess the effects of endogenous priority assignment to messages that have reached some specified aging threshold while in the network and to note the effects of Such priority assignment on network performance. The performance measures are average message delay, throughput, and number of messages undelivered. The routing techniques are demonstrated via simulation on an 8node highly connected network and a 19-node Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) network. The routing algorithms are applied with and without network element destruction on the selected networks."
"A new class of fast-converging timing recovery methods for synchronous digital data receivers is investigated. Starting with a worst-case timing offset, convergence with random binary data will typically occur within 10-20 symbols. The input signal is sampled at the baud rate; these samples are then processed to derive a suitable control signal to adjust the timing phase. A general method is outlined to obtain near-minimum-variance estimates of the timing offset with respect to a given steady-state sampling criterion. Although we make certain independence assumptions between successive samples and postulate ideal decisions to obtain convenient analytical results, our simulations with a decision-directed reference and baud-to-baud adjustments yield very similar results. Convergence is exponential, and for small loop gains the residual jitter is proportional and convergence time is inversely proportional to the loop gain. The proposed algorithms are simple and economic to implement. They apply to binary or multilevel PAM signals as well as to partial response signals."
"In this paper a theoretical explanation of the capture effect is given by calculating the instantaneous frequency of the output signal of a limiter when two frequency modulated (FM) signals are present at the limiter input. When this signal is applied to a demodulator with unlimited bandwidth, the output signal of the demodulator proves to have an extreme capture effect. When however the demodulator bandwidth is limited, the capture effect is shown not be be extreme. This phenomenon is explained and possibilities are given to minimize the capture effect. Some of the results of measurements on limiters and demodulators are given in this paper; they prove that a weak capture effect can be obtained. A method of calculating the degree of capturing is included."
"This paper provides a general analysis of the transmission characteristics of a coherent PSK signal, where anM-ary coherent signal is transmitted via a repeater system composed of a cascade ofNbandpass hard limiters. The probability density function of a composite phase of the signal and noise over the system is newly derived to obtain an error probability. In addition, the comparison with the repeater system composed of a cascade ofNlinear amplifiers is made to clarify the features of the transmission characteristics. It is found that the probability density function of the composite phase over the system is symmetric about each input carrier-to-noise power ratio (CNR), and it reduces to some well-known results. It is also shown that for a reasonably large input CNR in each stage, the presence of the bandpass hard limiter (BPHL) provides some improvement, but that for small input CNR it causes degradation in performance."
"A general performance equation is derived for digital receivers in the presence of impulse noise. Two bounding techniques are employed to simplify the results. First, the Schwarz inequality removes the dependence on both the impulse noise waveforms and the signal-set basis functions. Second, the Chebyshev inequality is applied to the Schwarz results to additionally eliminate the statistical dependence on the probability density function of the noise waveform weighting factor. The bound curves are compared to specific theoretical results where the noise waveforms and probability density functions have been assumed. The tightness of the bound curves is a function of the signal-energy-to-noise-weighting-factor variance ratio and converges for the Schwarz bound as the ratio increases. Considerably looser bounds are obtained by the Chebyshev technique, but rough estimates of system performance can be obtained when the signalenergy-to-signal-energy-to-noise-variance ratio is the only known parameter."
"An approach is presented for the analysis of phase-locked loops whose input signal has passed through time-varying channels. The specific channels considered in detail are the Rice-Nakagami, Rayleigh, and lognormal fading channels. Loop performance is characterized in terms of the steady-state probability density function of the reduced phase error process. The basic parameters which characterize performance include the loop signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the variance and bandwidth of the fading components introduced by the channel. Particular channel models are used to illustrate the theory for the firstorder loop. The results are also applied to the analysis of the PSK noisy reference problem in the presence of these time-varying channels."
"A first-order mixture noise density is considered as a model for impulsive noise channels. It consists of a mixture of a small variance, probably Gaussian, background noise pdf and a large variance impulsive pdf. Optimal nonlinear detector structures for known discretetime signals in such noise are derived. Their large-sample performance compared to that of a linear detector is studied using asymptotic relative efficiency."
"When speech is coded using a differential pulse-code modulation system with an adaptive quantizer, the digital code words exhibit considerable variation among all quantization levels during both voiced and unvoiced speech intervals. However, because of limits on the range of step sizes, during silent intervals the code words vary only slightly among the smallest quantization steps. Based on this principle, a simple algorithm for locating the beginning and end of a speech utterance has been developed. This algorithm has been tested in computer simulations and has been constructed with standard integrated circuit technology."
"Generalizations of the simple sign detector are considered for nonparametric detection. Nonparametric operation is obtained with only a symmetry assumption on the noise density functions, by basing the detectors on conditional statistical tests. The performance (both asymptotic and finite-sample, finite-signal) of the generalized sign detector is shown to be very good compared to the Wilcoxon detector and to the linear detector, whereas the detector structure remains simple."
"A class of second-order greedy algorithms (SOGA) for the optimization of multipoint networks is defined that is capable of generating improved solutions to problems by an average of more than two percent, relative to the solutions generated by the Esau-Williams algorithm. These SOGA utilize repeated calls of a modified Esau-Williams procedure. They consequently take much longer to execute than does the Esau-Williams algorithm. Nevertheless, problems involving up to 400 points can be solved on a large computer, and 200-point problems can be solved on machines of intermediate size."
"In a Jackson-type queuing network with feedback, the equilibrium state distribution of each queue is that of anM/M/ssystem. In support of a previous conjecture that nevertheless the input processes in such a network are not Poisson, the marginal interarrival-time distribution for an equilibriumM/M/1queuing system with feedback, counting both fed-back and exogenous customers as arrivals, is calculated. Since this distribution is a mixture of two exponentials, the total input to such a system is not Poisson."
"The signal design problem for FSK communication via fading dispersive channels is considered. The channel is modeled as a linear filter whose time-varying impulse response is a sample function from a zero-mean Gaussian random field of arbitrary WSSUS type. The additive noise component in the received waveforms is supposed to be a zero-mean white Gaussian random process, and maximum likelihood demodulation is assumed. The signal design procedure here adopted consists of minimizing a known upper bound on the error probability, whereas the previous similar design method by Daly intended maximizing an upper bound on the detection probability for radar-astronomy targets. Though with slightly different optimal numerical values, here, as in Daly's problem, the signal design depends on a single parameter which is a simple functional of the channel timefrequency covariance function and of the signal envelope ambiguity function. A detailed example shows how the results of this concise paper can be used to optimize signal parameters and to predict the performance loss due to nonoptimal signal envelopes."

"A general approach to the problem of designing structurally constrained receivers for signal detection and estimation is proposed. The approach is based on the constrained Bayesian methodology wherein risk-minimizing inference (or decision) rules are modified (constrained) by replacement of true posterior probabilities with estimated posterior probabilities. The estimators are structurally constrained minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimators for random posterior probabilities. This methodology is, in essence, an extension and generalization of the well-known linear MMSE estimation methodology. The approach is employed to design linearly constrained coherent receivers for signals in additive and multiplicative noise, and quadratically constrained noncoherent receivers for signals in additive noise. An analysis of these receivers shows that they are very similar to those that are optimum for additive Gaussian noise. The methodology provides a unified theory of receiver design based on the constrained MMSE criterion. This unification yields new insight into this old approach, clarifying both strengths and weaknesses of the approach."
"This concise paper is concerned with the problem of improved delta-coding by using delayed decision instead of bit-bit-by-bit decision. It is found that delayed encoding allows a fairly general predictor to be used without causing instability problems. Simulations indicate that considerable improvement can be achieved by matching the feedback filter to the input process. Delayed encoding requires a search algorithm for making the decisions. Some proposals of algorithms that are efficient from a computational point of view are presented. Particular interest is attached to a highly truncated version of the Viterbi algorithm, which seems very promising."
"A framework for controlling transmission quality of international connections is the joint responsibility of CCITT Study Groups XII, XV, XVI and Special D. These study groups recommend rating methods, overall performance objectives, network plans, and equipment characteristics. Still closer cooperation may help to avoid unnecessary regional differences in equipment standards, as in today's PCM multiplexes."
"This correspondence presents a modification to the Bello single-integral troposcatter channel model. The objective of the modification is to improve the model's ability to accurately predict the delay power spectrum of troposcatter paths of less than 150 mi. The model was modified by treating the scatter-angle exponent as a function of path length rather than a constant. The data from six shortrange troposcatter paths were compared with Bello model predictions using various values of the scatter-angle exponent. The results indicate a possible first-order relationship between the scatter-angle exponent and path length. Use of this relationship in the Bello model significantly improved the prediction performance for the six paths analyzed."
"Continuous-phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) is discussed and theoretical predictions for symbol error probabilities are derived, where the memory inherent in the phase continuity is used to improve performance. Previously known results concluded that binary CPFSK can outperform coherently detected PSK at high SNR. New results presented here show thatM-ary CPFSK outperforms more tranditionally usedM-ary modulation systems. Specifically, coherently detected quaternary CPFSK with a five-symbol interval decision can outperform coherent QPSK by 3.5 dB, and octal coherent CPFSK with a three- symbol decision can outperform octal orthogonal signaling by 2.6 dB at high SNR. Results for coherently detected and noncoherently detected CPFSK are derived. These performance improvements are estimates derived from symbol error probability upper bounds. Monte Carlo simulation was performed which then verified the results."
"Second-order phase-locked loops with signal injection (PLLI's) have orders of magnitude larger pull-in ranges than conventional second-order PLL's with identical natural frequencies and damping factors. The PLLI utilizes a little-known characteristic of the Van der Pol oscillator, and for practically no additional hardware the pullin range is increased sufficiently to eliminate in many cases the need for crystal control of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). In nonlinear systems (e.g., a retiming chain of a digital repeater) where the in-phase and in-quadrature noise components are correlated, the PLLI in addition features a significant reduction in output phase jitter. A 44.6MHz PLLI, designed for timing recovery in a fiber optic repeater, has 8.4-kHz conventional minimum jitter bandwidth. To reduce time jitter accumulation in a chain of repeaters, the damping factor was increased to 4 resulting in aQof 1300. The pull-in range of this loop is 9.6 MHz compared to 18 kHz for the same loop without signal injection. The static phase error is\\pm 0.6\\degfor ± 0.3 MHz oscillator drift. By injecting with 18° phase lag, the PLLI can take advantage of the correla tion between amplitude and phase noise components and the total output phase jitter is reduced by 10.5 dB due to destructive interference."
"The application of 14/12 GHz and higher allocated frequency bands in commercial satellite communications systems has been retarded by the problem of slow deep fading due principally to rain attenuation on the earth-station-to-satellite and satellite-satellite-to-earthstation radio links. The large carrier-to-noise ratio(C/N)margins required to ensure good link performance for a large percentage of time may be excessive, and a more sophisticated method of dealing with fading is required. The methods available fall broadly into two categories, one employing diversity and the other adaptive compensation techniques. This paper examines a link compensation method, namely up-link power control at the transmitting earth station, that effectively reduces the effects of both up- and down-link fading in a frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA) satellite system having a large number of accesses. The transmitted level of each carrier accessing the satellite transponder is dynamically adjusted to compensate the combination of up- and down-link fading experienced by the carrier. While this leads to wide variations in individual carrier levels into the satellite, the assumed independence of fades on the down-link to each of the receiving earth stations means that variations in multicarrier TWT operating point tend to be small (providing no one earth station receives a highly disproportionate share of the traffic). By essentially pooling among many links the effects of deep fades simultaneously present on only a few links, this technique will reduceC/Nvariations on individual carriers, thereby reducing required fade margins. This paper derives expressions for the earth-station-to-earth-station link fade probability density function (pdf) with and without transmit power control. The theoretical effects of noisy estimates of the up- and down link fades and quantization of the transmitted powers are considered. Simple asymptotic expressions applicable when the number of accesses is large are also derived. Computed results demonstrate that transmit power control can substantially reduce the fade margins required in homogeneous single channel per carrier (SCPC) systems operating in the 14/12 GHz band. Some detection and control problems associated with a practical implementation of the scheme are introduced."
"This paper presents a coherent method which permits the specification, check out, and implementation of communication protocols. Although this work is mainly directed towards telephone signaling in a programmable environment, the philosophy and most of the tools can be effectively used to handle the most general situations in which two entities interact by any kind of protocol. Since the proposed approach reduces the possibility of errors and inconsistencies, minimizes the programming needed, and improves the documentation and understandability, we believe that this methodology will facilitate the installation or modification of complex trunk protocols and other communication protocols."
"Basic node-to-node protocol of a packet-switched network based on the multiplexing of the link intoNlogical channels is first described. The node structure is then described based on a set of queues, an input routine, a main-task routine, and an output routine. Three protocols which are based on different implementations of the transmission of the acknowledgment (ACK) block are then introduced. The first one is the 1972 version of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the second places the ACK block in regular packets, and the third uses only control packets. The simulation program developed to compare these protocols is then described. It studies the behavior of a link between two nodes, which consists of a full-duplex line and of two sets of queues. The rest of the packet-switched network is simulated by a packet generator which feeds the two sides of the link. First, comparison of protocols is done using symmetrical and asymmetrical loading conditions. In this last case, interesting results are obtained in relation to momentary saturation of theNlogical channels. The influence of the limitation of buffers allocated to an output line is also discussed. Sensitivity of protocols to reverse traffic characteristics is then studied and, based on the results, choice of a protocol is discussed. Based on the dynamic behavior of the queue, some questions are raised in connection with adaptive-routing algorithms."
"The repeat request codeword in an ARQ data transmission can be the detected error syndrome. In that case, there exists an optimal single-burst detecting scheme which improves the throughput of a Stop and Wait scheme, especially under high error rate conditions."
"This correspondence is an extension of the work in [1] and [2]. We present two new classes of error detectors which utilize symbol reliability information (i.e., soft decision error detectors). First, a simple class of selectively single error correcting error detectors is discussed where the syndrome information is used and where just one single reliability number is compared to a threshold value. These error detectors are simpler than those in [1] and [2], but less powerful. Second, a class of soft decision error detectors with low probability of undetected errors is considered. The reliability information is used to reduce the probability of undetected errors without increasing the repeat request probability (compared to the hard decision error detector). Exponential properties for large signal-to-noise ratios and bounds are calculated for both classes of error detectors. Computer simulations are also presented."
"The performance of short constraint length convolutional codes in conjunction with binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) modulation and Viterbi maximum likelihood decoding on the classical Rician fading channel is examined in detail. Primary interest is in the bit error probability performance as a function ofE_{b}/N_{0}parameterized by the fading channel parameters. Fairly general upper bounds on bit error probability performance in the presence of fading are obtained and compared with simulation results in the two extremes of zero channel memory and infinite channel memory. The efficacy of simple block interleaving in combating the memory of the channel is thoroughly explored. Results include the effects of fading on tracking loop performance and the subsequent impact on overall coded system performance. The approach is analytical where possible; otherwise resort is made to digital computer simulation."
"The telecommunications in Indonesia is reviewed with emphasis on transmission and switching networks.

 "An economical microwave radio relay system in 2-GHz and 4-GHz bands for developing areas can be realized by the combination of extremely low-power-consumption radio equipment and static power supply equipment, such as thermoelectric generators, solar cells, etc. High reliability of this system minimizes the number of maintenance personnel and of routine inspection tours to economize the system operation cost. The system in the 4-GHz band is capable of transmitting up to 1800 telephone channels, yet it features outstanding economy in television or telephone channel transmission up to 960 channels, especially in remote areas. System description, comparison with a conventional system, and a brief radio equipment description are presented here."
"Technology for planning communications systems has generally been designed for applications in well-developed communication networks. There exists a question on the appropriateness of these techniques and equipment to developing countries with a high growth rate. This paper discusses five aspects of telecommunication planning for the high growth era in developing countries: forecasting, concept of service, planning technology, appropriate equipment, and technological flexibility."
"The International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) work that is oriented towards the needs of developing countries is described. This work is explained as one of two kinds of technical cooperation; the other kind corresponds to the ITU's traditional function as coordinator and standards-maker for international working of telecommunication services. It is shown how these two kinds of technical cooperation both aid each other and compete with each other for funds, top-level organizational attention, and provision of expert manpower. The growth and diversity of cooperative activities for the benefit of developing countries is reviewed in some detail. Numerous examples of handbook-writing and special national or regional projects are given. It is concluded that the ITU exhibits two faces, one directed toward the highly developed country, another toward the developing country in need of help. Maintaining a judicious balance in support of these two personalities represents a challenge to the ITU as a whole, and to its Permanent Organs in particular."
"Many different techniques have been studied in the past for correlating the growth of a telecommunications network with the economic growth of a country in an attempt to allocate capital resources optimally. With suitable modifications, several of these techniques have been found to have some broad application, but no universally applicable technique has yet been developed. Of the methods developed to date, however, several of the more intensive ones can usefully be applied to developing countries where the present telephone density is very low in comparison with the industrialized countries. This paper presents the results of using a macroanalytic technique in correlating these factors for several selected countries in Latin America. The results are then discussed in the context of basic telephone demand parameters and the current dynamic technological and economic environment."

"By the end of the Fifth Plan, March 21, 1978, Iran will have expanded its telecommunication service threefold, it will be providing educational program and television to nearly 75 percent of its population, and it will be well on its way to accomplishing its longrange goal of a totally integrated telecommunication system. It will have graduated telecommunication engineers and technicians from the PTT College of Telecommunications Engineering. Radio and television production specialists will be graduated from the NIRT College which recently incorporated a Master's Program. It will also have expanded present telecommunication manufacturing capabilities and started new joint ventures. Where it is now, where it intends to be, and how it intends to get there are described in this paper."
"The public telecommunication network of Turkey is briefly discussed in this paper. The existing telephone, telegraph, data, and other related services are summarized, and future trends in some of these services are indicated. These trends suggest that capital investments on the telecommunication services must be at least doubled in order that the standards in the country compete with those of the world averages. Finally, some of the research in communications is cited."
"Adequate telecommunications facilities to meet both internal and external telecommunications requirements are important prerequisites for a country's development. The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) has been cognizant of this fact, and has endeavored to respond to the needs of the developing world in a variety of ways. This paper discusses why developing countries have turned to INTELSAT to meet their telecommunications requirements, how INTELSAT has responded to this need and fostered such usage, and what activities INTELSAT is contemplating for the future which are likely to continue and improve upon this trend."
"The expansion and improvement of telecommunication services in developing countries is faced with a number of problems of implementation and of method. The problems of implementation have well-established solutions and, therefore, are only briefly discussed in this paper. The main focus of this paper is concentrated on four classes of problems related to method, namely: 1) demand forecasting and its impact on system performance; 2) economic evaluation with special regard to social factors; 3) pricing; and 4) technological dependence on foreign countries. The problems need considerably more research and field work before results of any permanence and general validity are obtained. The paper concludes that dealing with these and related problems of method needs an essentially interdisciplinary approach. It further suggests that only some international technical and development organizations may, in the foreseeable future, be in the position to undertake interdisciplinary sectoral telecommunication studies of adequate breadth and depth to yield meaningful tools for better utilization of the scarce telecommunication resources in developing countries."
"In developing countries telecommunication policies are based on the urban development program. It is pointed out that the telecommunication needs of the developing countries lie in both the urban and rural areas and as a result two distinct networks, urban and rural, are needed. Establishment of a National Rural Telecommunication Agency is suggested to implement the concept of rural networks."
"This paper draws attention to the outstanding feature of present telecommunications in developing countries, namely that most of the equipment is installed in towns but most people live in rural areas. Various features of the social environment are outlined, indicating their importance for planning and choice of technology. Social change is shown to offer the opportunity for telecommunication development but it also poses the main challenge to planning. The paper outlines the main constraints to choice of technology, emphasizing those that relate to the socioeconomic environment in the rural areas. Within these constraints, a pragmatic approach is advocated which admits both old and modern technological solutions. A discussion of the technology-transfer question develops a conceptual framework within which this approach may be justified."
"Some of the special problems and constraints associated with African Continental Telecommunications axe reviewed. A description of plans to establish a continental terrestrial telecommunication network-now called the Pan-African Telecommunication (PANAFTEL)network is given together with traffic predictions. Future development of such a network in a rapidly expanding traffic environment is surveyed taking into account the complementary role which a domestic satellite communication system would play."
"Some developing nations, such as Iran, have the resources for rapid economic development. Typically, that development requires very large and rapid expansion of education and training programs. An educational television (ETV) system is shown to be an effective tool for providing the needed expansion as long as it is used primarily for training adults. This conclusion is based on a detailed analysis of successful ETV operations in the United States and Great Britain. Specific functions needed for effective ETV application are identified, and organizational guidelines are proposed."

"The object of this paper is to define the third way to telecommunication development-suitable to the needs and conditions of the third world countries. It begins with some comments on the present conditions, identifies probable reasons, and defines three fundamental goals for developing nations: 1) rural communication,2) accessibility, and 3) reliability. Based on these three goals, the third way to telecommunication development is defined. The need for an autonomous telecommunication technology center for the third world is emphasized, and its objectives, organization, and implementation are discussed. A need for new systems geared toward increasing accessibility is advocated. As an example, a new concept called the \"community telephone\" is introduced, which is designed to provide reliable telecommunication service to a small community. At the end, it is concluded that the real implication of the third way to telecommunication development can only be analyzed through further interdisciplinary research."
"This paper examines the state of telecommunications in developing countries with special emphasis on telecommunication technology and telephone statistics such as number of telephones, telephone density and demand. First, the notion of a developing world is formulated in terms of social and economic conditions, and its existing telecommunication needs are reviewed. Then the state of telecommunication is portrayed in terms of various international telephone statistics and is compared with those of the industrialized world. Typical government-controlled telecommunication organizations responsible for providing telephone services, associated manpower, and training needs are then discussed. The technology is reviewed from the viewpoint of local capabilities, ancillary industries, and foreign know-how as well as the pricing policy for telecommunication services, based on highly unsatisfied demand. At the end, two aspects of telecommunication in developing countries are explored: 1) the administrative aspect that emphasizes growth and production, and 2) the users aspect that represents a long waiting period, heavy investment, poor voice quality, and inadequate maintenance."

A detailed equipment description is reported and the results of the field trial on an experimental link are given."
"Underwater acoustic communications channels involving surface reflection usually exhibit extensive time and frequency spreading. The phenomenon was studied in a recent paper [5] and the scattering function of the channel was obtained for large Rayleigh parameters using a Fresnel-corrected geometric optics model and a simple onedimensional surface correlation function. It was found that while extensive time spreading and Doppler were indeed predicted by this model, the Doppler shift and time delay were strongly correlated so that the scattering function had the form of a very narrow parabolic ridge. The problem considered in this paper is the extent to which this phenomenon persists when more realistic correlation-function models, dispersion, and small Rayleigh parameters are considered. It is found that the general form of the scattering function is not very much affected by fairly gross changes in the assumed surface statistics, and that substantial correlation between time delay and Doppler can be expected as long as the surface is not completely isotropic. The effect is also observed in a modified form with a small Rayleigh-parameter model, but since this model also features a strong coherent component it may be of less practical significance."
"A formula for signal-to-quantizing noise ratio (SNR) in delta modulation systems is obtained by modifying an existing result for DPCM systems. Computer simulation is used to examine the behavior of the terms in the modified SNR formula."
"In recent years, minimum-shift-keying (MSK) has gained increasing popularity as a modulation technique because of its desirable spectral properties. Quite often, the spectral concentration provided by MSK is not sufficient to meet requirements on out-of-band energy spillover. In these situations, one might apply additional input pulse shaping m such a way as to still maintain constant envelope signals. The properties of such MSK-type signals are the subject of this paper. Specific examples are included as illustrations of the theory both for the binary andM-ary cases."
"Adaptive equalizers are usually realized in the form of a transversal filter with variable tap gains and tap spacing equal to the symbol spacingT. The performance of these equalizers depends critically on the symbol-clock phase derived in the receiver, due to the clock-phase dependent aliasing of the spectral roll-off components, upon which the conventional equalizer has no influence. In this paper we study the possibility of overcoming this difficulty by making the tap spacing of the equalizer somewhat smaller thanT(fractional tap spacing). It is shown that this leads to satisfactory performance of the equalizer for a broad continuous range of clock phases, without penalizing the speed of convergence. Furthermore, it allows the application of a simple clock recovery scheme which derives a phase control signal from the equalizer tap-gain values."
"A closed form expression is derived for the pull-in range of second-order phase-locked loops (PLL's) with sinusoidal phase detectors. Pull-in range, normalized with respect to gainG, is expressed as a function of the damping factor\\zetaand normalized natural frequency β of the linearized loop model. Results are presented for various values of β and\\zetaand compared with earlier results."
"A new statistic is described for hypothesis testing on phase in the presence of narrow-band normal noise when the true phase, itself, is a nonuniformly distributed random variable. Comparisons are made with the more standard direct techniques."
"Packet-switching broadcast radio networks are receiving considerable attention as a feasible solution for applications involving fast network deployment requirements, inaccessible physical environments, and mobile communication devices. Such networks also offer economic alternatives to traditional multiplexing schemes for local distribution. Most of the published papers relating to packet-switching broadcast radio networks address the case in which all communication devices are within an effective transmission range of the destination receiver, thus forming a single-hop network in which no packet routing is involved. In this paper, we address multihop networks. The problems encountered in packet transportation are identified and strategies to resolve these are proposed."
"A multidigit adaptive delta modulation (ADM) system has been proposed where the error signal, between the input and the approximated signal produced by ADM coder, is coded in an auxiliary encoder. The error in the auxiliary coder is processed by another ADM and so on. The bit rate of each of these coders isf_{r}/Nwhere fris the overall transmission rate andNis the number of coders used. The bit streams are interleaved for transmission and at the receiver they are separated and decoded, and these signals are added and filtered. It is shown that for a given transmission rate, each coder operates at a basic sampling rate of frBsuch thatN_{opt} = f_{r}/f_{rB}gives the optimum number of coders to be used for maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A bound is derived for the maximum SNR of such a system and is compared with the bounds derived for other predictive coders. The experimental results of a two-digit ADM are presented. An average SNR of 30 dB is obtained with a dynamic range of 32 dB at fr= 32 kbits/s for band-limited noise signals. The SNR increases with the sampling rate at 15 dB/octave, as against 9 dB for a single-digit ADM. The frequency response is good and the variation of SNR with the message frequency of the delta coding system has been improved. The effect of channel errors has also been studied and the performance of the system is found satisfactory."
"Rice's click model for ideal FM detection is applied to systems with co-channel interference. Output noise terms consist of a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) term due to noise alone, a term due to the desired signal beating with the interferer, and a term due to the clicks. Click rates are determined with and without modulation and it is shown that in the computation of noise due to clicks the interferer can be treated as a simple sinusoid [i.e., an unmodulated carrier] Plots are given for detected SNR versus carrier-to-noise (CNR) with signal-to-interferer ratio (SIR) and modulation index as parameters. The effect of signal suppression is analyzed and for the range of parameters used in this paper it is found to be negligible."
"This paper demonstrates that an offset quadrature amplitude-shift-keyed (OQASK) signal can be represented as an ncomponent version of a minimum-shift-keyed (MSK) signal. For example, the signal set obtained by summing two MSK signals which are 6 dB different in power and are formed by continuous phase, frequency modulating the same oscillator with two independent binary antipodal data streams, is spectrally equivalent to an OQASK signal set composed of 16 signals in which the symbol pulse is a half-cycle sinusoid rather, than the conventional rectangular form. Such generalizations as the above allow for potentially simpler implementation of spectrally shaped OQASK."
"An equivalent linear model for minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) linear estimation of marked and filtered doubly stochastic Poisson processes is presented. The equivalence is employed to determine the structure of the MMSE noncausal steady-state linear receiver for synchronousm-ary optical data signals."
"The technique of nearly instantaneous companding (NIC) that we describe processesn-bit μ-law or A-law encoded pulse-code modulation (PCM) to a reduced bit rate. A block ofNsamples (typicallyN \\cong 10) is searched for the sample having the largest magnitude, and each sample in the block is then reencoded to a nearly uniform quantization having (n - 2) bits and an overload point at the top of the chord of the maximum sample. Since an encoding of this chord must be sent to the receiver along with the uniform reencoding, the resulting bit rate isf_{s}(n -2 + 3/N)bits/s where fsis the sampling rate. The algorithm can be viewed as an adaptive PCM algorithm that is compatible with the widely used μ-law andA-law companded PCM. Theoretical and empirical evidence is presented which indicates a performance slightly better than (n - 1) bit companded PCM (the bit rate is close to that of (n - 2) bit PCM). A feature which distinguishes NIC from most other bit-rate reduction techniques is a performance that is largely insensitive to the statistics of the input signal."
"The use of chaff for establishing communications of limited duration between nonadjacent troposcatter stations is investigated. The optimum location for the release of chaff is determined theoretically considering the path geometry, the antenna elevation and directivity, and the weather and atmospheric effects. Amplitude, polarization, and fading characteristics of the signal energy scattered by chaff are calculated and the type and weight of chaff required to provide a given signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is estimated. Experiments which were conducted to check the validity of the theoretical calculation are then described. Finally, a practical scheme for overpassing troposcatter stations and for communications between mobile users which are not in line of sight is considered."
"The matrices which are symmetric about both diagonals (persymmetric matrices) occur often in communication and information theory problems. There have been a number of problems whose solution involves the eigenvectors of persymmetric matrices. This paper summarizes a number of properties of the eigenvectors of persymmetric matrices and demonstrates how they can be applied to characterize and simplify the solution to a number of communication problems."
"Minimum shift keying (MSK) and offset keyed quadrature phase shift keying (OK-QPSK) modulation techniques are often proposed for use on nonlinear, severely band-limited communication channels because both techniques retain low sidelobe levels on such channels, while allowing efficient detection performance. A more detailed performance comparison of the two techniques on such channels is, therefore, of interest. In this paper a Markov process representation is developed which is applicable to either the MSK or OK-QPSK waveform. This representation is employed to illustrate the similarity between the modulation processes and to obtain the autocorrelations and power spectral densities of the two waveforms. This Markov process representation may be similarly employed with other modulation waveforms of the same class. The autocorrelations and power Spectral densities of MSK and offset QPSK provide initial insight to expected performance on band-limited channels. The results of a digital computer simulation are presented. The simulation compares the bit error rates (BER's) of MSK and offset QPSK on nonlinear, band-limited double-hop links such as encountered in satellite communications. The simmulation results are presented asE_{b}/N_{0}degradation with respect to ideal detection versus channel noise bandwidth. The error probability was used as a performance metric, and equal adjacent channel interference as a constraint. For the channels simulated, MSK is found to provide superior performance when the channel noise bandwidth exceeds about 1.1 times the binary data rate. For narrower bandwidths, offset QPSK provides superior performance."
"Here we continue the analytic study of packet switching in radio channels which we reported upon m our two previous papers [1], [2] Again we consider a population of terminals communicating with a central station over a packet-switched radio channel. The allocation of bandwidth among the contending terminals can be fixed [e.g., time-division multiple access (TDMA) or frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)], random [e.g., ALOHA or carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)] or centrally controlled (e.g., polling or reservation). In this paper we show that with a large population of bursty users, (as expected) random access is superior to both fixed assignment and polling. We also introduce and analyze a dynamic reservation technique which we call split-channel reservation multiple access (SRMA) which is interesting in that it is both simple and efficient over a large range of system parameters."
"The performance of a matched filter square-law envelope detector is investigated for a new signal-in-noise model, that of a partially coherent-fading random-phase sine wave in additive zero-mean noise. This model is of interest when analyzing the effects of random amplitude and/or phase channels on narrow-band input signals. The amplitude and the phase of the sine wave are assumed to be independent random processes with known bandwidths. This paper obtains deflection-criteria detection-performance results for the envelope detector as a function of the bandwidths of the amplitude and phase of the signal process, the noise process, the observation time, and the second-moment statistics of the amplitude, phase, and noise processes. The results show quantitatively that the detection performance of the envelope detector is much more sensitive to loss of phase coherence than to loss of amplitude coherence."
"A simple calculation is made for the power spectral density (psd) of a sinusoid phase modulated by a filtered Gaussian process. The premodulation filter has a Gaussian-shaped frequency response. Design curves are presented for the out-of-band interference, the in-band power, and the psd in terms of the premodulation filter's bandwidth and the rms modulation index."
"Superconductive coaxial cable has been investigated to survey its feasibility as a communication medium with enormous capacity. The measurements of the frequency and the temperature dependences of the attenuation of coaxial pairs show that dielectric loss is dominant at 4.2 K, but conductor loss increases and gets the attenuation sensitive to temperature as 5 K is exceeded at a few gigahertz. The effect of periodic impedance lrregularities, which is the greatest problem in the transmission characteristics, has been solved by the improvement of the manufacturing process based on spectral analysis of the dimensional variations of the materials, and it is suggested that superconductive coaxial line is applicable to wide-band communication. A thermal insulation pipe for the cable is manufactured and its insulation efficiency is measured. The feasibility of superconductive coaxial cable Will be increased not only by developing the refrigeration system, but also by applying superconductive materials with low surface resistance and critical temperatures higher than lead."
"A new technique for the display of continuous tone images on a bilevel graphical output device is described. This technique belongs to the general class of algorithms that convey intensity information by the spatial arrangement of lit and unlit cells which are in a one-to-one correspondence with the picture elements (PEL's) in the original image. Besides the rendition of a gray scale in the processed image, the new algorithm also incorporates edge emphasis to increase the legibility of textual information and other areas of high detail. A simple theory of the algorithm, derived from an intensity distribution function, is given, along with the details of an implementation and results obtained using the new technique. The technique is interesting as it requires a nonzero noise component in the image signal being processed in order to generate a gray scale."
"This concise paper considers the effect on the autocorrelation function of a pseudonoise (PN) code when the acquisition scheme only integrates coherently over part of the code and then noncoherently combines these results. The peak-to-null ratio of the effective PN autocorrelation function is shown to degrade ton^{-1/2}, wherenis the number of PN symbols over which coherent integration takes place."
 "The method of inversion of linear discrete time systems utilizing quantized feedback is examined, and a stability concept is developed. The application in mind is decision feedback equalization (DFE). Sets of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for stability are derived. A lower bound for the probability of recovery from error, and an upper bound for the mean recovery time are obtained. It is suggested that a stability index for each system could be defined. The bounds derived do not depend on the nature of the noise or the channel impulse response except through its length."
"A new approach to echo canceling for two-wire fullduplex data transmission is proposed. The canceling signal is directly synthesized from the binary data, using a transversal filter approach, and the usual multiplications are replaced by additions and subtractions, thus allowing efficient operation of a large number of taps as required for the canceling of distant echoes. As a specific application, a system processing one sample per baud is discussed where timing signals at both communicating stations are assumed to be synchronized. A stochastic adjustment gradient-type algorithm is used for both training and adaptive tracking of the canceler. It is shown that convergence does not depend on intersymbol interference, timing phase, carrier phase, or the energy ratio of the local to the received signal, but is a function only of the number of taps. Convergence time is proportional to that number, and the optimum step size for fastest convergence is equal to the reciprocal of the number of taps. The residual fluctuation noise is proportional to that part of the mean-square (MS) error which cannot be reduced by the canceler and is a simple function of the product of the tap signal and the step size. The predicted convergence properties are verified by simulation results. Finally, it is shown how such an echo canceler might be used to allow two-wire full-duplex transmission for data rates as high as 4800 bit/s."

"Using a probabilistic approach, expressions are obtained for the time delay suffered by a signal propagating through the ionosphere at VHF. The analysis indicates that a first-moment effect (due to the average electron density) and a second-moment effect (due to fluctuations in the angles determined by Snell's laws) superpose. The analysis then leads to three expressions for the first-moment effect, which coincide with those in use."
"A \"square\" pulse, positive or negative, is sent along a uniform transmission line from\\ell = 0and is regenerated at\\ell = L, with some probability of error. The pulse is possibly regenerated at an intermediate point. In all the most reliable channels and in several others that we have examined, the best intermediate point for regeneration is the midpoint,\\ell = L/2, but it is sometimes better still not to regenerate at any intermediate point. Some of the theory might be suggestive for explaining why the \"nodes of Ranvier\" are approximately equally spaced in neural axons. For some of the less reliable channels the midpoint is locally worst or even absolutely worst, and the optimal intermediate regeneration point is elsewhere, at say\\ell = \\ell_{1}(or equally good atL - ell_{1}, by symmetry)."
"Data communication systems are often beset with the problem of dc offset. The questions addressed and answered in this concise paper are: 1) can minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) equalizers correct dc offset? 2) what are the exact effects of the equalizer on offset, and offset on residual MSE? We conclude that MMSE equalizers can reduce the effects of dc offset but cannot completely eliminate them. Quantitative results give residual MSE as a function of offset magintude, equalizer length, and signal energy."
"The transmission of digital telephony or data, alone and together with analog video, over analog-repeatered coaxial-cable lines is discussed. Expressions for the total random noise power and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived. These expressions include the effects of thermal noise and the intermodulation distortion due to nonlinearity in the analog repeater amplifiers. The dependence of the SNR on system parameters, particularly the signal level and the repeater spacing, for systems that carry digital telephony, video, or both, is discussed and its implications on system design are noted."
"The Karhunen-Loeve transform for a class of signals is proven to be a set of periodic sine functions and this Karhunen-Loeve series expansion can be obtained via an FFT algorithm. This fast algorithm obtained could be useful in data compression and other mean-square signal processing applications."
"The basic problem with all previous methods of bandwidth compression has been that the accuracy of the reconstructed waveform has been poorly controlled. By reconstructing the wavefrom from the compressed digital signal before transmission and creating the error waveform, i.e., substracting the reconstructed from the original waveform to produce the error waveform, followed by adding points to be transmitted, where the error waveform is greater than specified, a process which may be iterated, the residual error in the final reconstructed signal may be reduced to any arbitrary amount. Unlike \"run-length coding\" only the minimum number of points necessary to reconstruct the waveform are generated. By introducing a time delay, considerable bandwidth compression would be possible while keeping predetermined accuracy specifications."
"This paper is the last part of a three-part series on threshold decoding new convolutional codes. The first part of this paper concludes the list with new rate 1/2 codes. For these codes a characteristic equation, in terms of the number of correctable errors and code constraint length, is derived by least square approximations. The second part of the paper is concerned with the usefulness of the codes derived including those in Parts I and II. Based upon the uncorrectable error statistics of the decoder, the concatenation of such codes is suggested. The characteristic of this class of codes with the property of not producing additional and bursty errors at the output of the decoder when the capability of the decoder is exceeded, is not shared by most powerful decoders such as Reed-Solomon, BCH, and Viterbi."
"In frequency-reuse communication systems using orthogonally polarized waves, depolarization due mainly to rain and Faraday rotation (in satellite systems) reduces channel isolation. The control system described, incorporating a network suggested by T. S. Chu, automatically compensates for cross-polarization coupling without using iterative methods or computations. Control voltages are generated on the receive side by phase-sensitive demodulation of beacons contained in the communication channels. Slightly modified conventional tracking receivers may be used for the demodulation. The system can be used for the reception of dual linear or dual circular polarizations without modification. An analysis of the control system behavior is given and a method for automatic initial balancing of the systemindependent of its initial state-is proposed."
"LINC is a technique that uses signal processing to produce Linear amplification of bandpass signals with grossly Nonlinear circuit Components. The important signal processing functions in LINC are forming two constant envelope phase modulated signal components from the bandpass input signal and recombining the amplified components to produce an amplified replica of the input signal. Two- and three-tone laboratory tests of a complete LINC amplifier show that, at full output, spurious levels 40 dB below tone level are achievable for tone spacings of 100 kHz. Because the laboratory model is operated at relatively low frequencies (hundreds of MHz), scaling up in frequency should result in a LINC with < 40 dB spurious over a considerably wider band. Lower spurious levels or bandwidths of several tens of MHz will require a\\sin^{-1}phase modulator that is less sensitive to delay in a feedback loop and a wider-bandwidth lower-distortion input limiter."
"Extreme-value theory has been suggested by various investigators as an efficient tool for use in monitoring the performance of digital communication systems. One drawback to such a procedure is that it requires learning periods to estimate certain parameters of the extremal distributions. Clearly, whenever an update of the estimates is needed, transmission of information must temporarily cease since a new learning period must begin. To avoid this problem, a technique is proposed for obtaining estimates of the parameters when the learning period is eliminated (i.e., estimates are obtained using noisy samples), and these parameter estimates are in turn used to estimate the probability of error of the communication system. The accuracy of this procedure is tested by computer simulation, and it is indicated how one can verify (in a statistical sense) whether or not this technique is appropriate for any given system."
"In digital speech communication, transmission errors generally introduce impulsive distortions in the received speech waveform. Smoothing of this waveform results at once in a squelching of the distortion component, and in an undesirable smearing of the speech. However, our experience with practical differential PCM (DPCM) codes (with adaptive quantizers and first-order predictors) has shown that if the error probability is fairly significant (for example, 0.025), the noise attenuation is perceptually desirable in spite of the attendant speech-muffling. Our observations are based on computer simulations and informal listening tests. The smoothing can be performed either on the received DPCM word (prediction error signal) or the reconstructed speech amplitude. (The two signals are identical in nondifferential PCM.) Smoothing algorithms can be either linear (based, for example, on running averages) or nonlinear (based, for example, on running medians). Studies with 3-bit quantizers indicate that with independently occurring transmission errors, smoothing of the prediction error signal is perceptually desirable, although the benefits decrease as a function of the predictor coefficient a, with the maximum advantage showing up fora = 0(PCM). Running averages and running medians seem to work equally well, and suggested block lengths for their computations are three or five samples. Results with clustered transmission errors show a higher advantage due to smoothing and a preference of linear methods and longer block lengths."
"Harmonic distortion imparted to the sidebands of an amplitude-modulated carrier by a system described by a Chebyshev series is evaluated. Sideband distortion increases with modulation depth but decreases with low carrier level, when even-harmonic contributions disappear."
"Construction methods for a pulse-position multifrequency code are considered. This code eliminates undesirable frequency combinations between adjacent codewords. Optional methods of dividing the frequency scale for low-speed multifrequency data transmission systems are discussed. This allows a choice of frequency scale depending upon the nonlinearity of the channel."
"The effects of independent bit errors are calculated for nonlinear PCM systems. General simplified computer formulas are given for natural binary and binary folded PCM codes. Analytical formulas are produced for μ-quantization, binary folded PCM, and speech-like input signal density functions."
"A quantitative relationship is derived between repeater section error objectives and system error objectives. The sum of the repeater section error rates is expressed in the form of a power sum. Wilkinson's approximation [4] is then used to approximate the log of the power sum with a normal distribution."
"The classical Viterbi decoder recursively finds the trellis path (code word) closest to the received data. Given the received data, the syndrome decoder first forms a syndrome instead. Having found the syndrome, that only depends on the channel noise, a recursive algorithm like Viterbi's determines the noise sequence of minimum Hamming weight that can he a possible cause of this syndrome. Given the estimate of the noise sequence, one derives an estimate of the original data sequence. The bit error probability of the syndrome decoder is no different from that of the classical Viterbi decoder. However, for short constraint length codes the syndrome decoder can be implemented using a read-only memory (ROM), thus obtaining a considerable saving in hardware. The syndrome decoder has at most\\frac{3}{4}as many path registers as does the Viterbi decoder. There exist convolutional codes for which the number of path registers can be even further reduced."
"Some calculations are presented for a uniformly spaced time-invariant tapped delay line simulation of a two-path propagation model using white noise and pseudonoise sequences as input signals. The results indicate that, at least for a straightforward approach, signalto-signal-to-interpolation-noise ratios are poorer than generally expected."
"A new method for calculating intelligible crosstalk between frequency-division multiplexed (FDM) angle-modulated carriers has been developed and is directly applicable to multicarrier operation in communications satellite systems. The analysis is general in scope and accounts for both the nonlinear amplitude and phase characteristics of the amplifying device by the use of a complex Bessel function expansion. Group delay and amplitude variation preceding the input of the nonlinear device are modeled using a Fourier series expansion. FDM baseband loading is also considered in the analysis. A comparison of theoretical results with measurement shows good agreement."
"Transmission of data with receiver-controlled bit rate is an effective way to reduce the effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations, as in a fading channel. All previous publications on this subject ignore the critical topic of buffer size. This concise paper summarizes the results of the first study of the effect of finite buffers on a variable-rate system for fading channels."
"A study is presented which permits the formal analysis and synthesis of recoverable computer communication protocols. This study is based on a formal representation of processes by a model of computation, the Petri nets (PN's). The PN model is generalized to include a representation of the possible failures, and then, the concept of \"recoverability\" is formally defined. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions which a process must satisfy in order to be recoverable is derived. In the PN model, the processes that satisfy these conditions are shown to have some practical limitations. A new model, the time-Petri net (TPN), is introduced to remove these limitations. This new model allows the introduction of constraints in the execution times of its part. As shown in this paper, the TPN appears to be a suitable model for the study of practical recoverable processes. Several practical communication protocols are formally designed and analyzed using this new model, and some interesting properties of these protocols are formally derived."
"A digital transversal postdetection filter for use in differential PSK demodulation is proposed, and a method for optimizing the weighting coefficients is presented. This low-pass filter is implemented using a finely spaced (relative to the symbol rate) tapped delay line whose tap weights are determined so as to minimize the overall mean-square error at the detector outputs. It is shown that even though the detector output signal is quadratic, the optimization problem can be formulated in a way similar to the well-known minimum-mean-square equalizer for linear signals. The filter design technique also accommodates nonideal detector structures, such as those employing hard limiters."
"We investigated the effects of channel errors on an adaptive delta modulator used to encode video signals. The investigation revealed that channel errors caused a permanent shift in the dc level of the delta modulator's estimate. Errors in the step size, on the other hand, were transitory and had no noticeable effect on the received pictures. We then presented three error correction schemes to minimize the visibility of the channel errors in the received picture. The first scheme required the transmitter to periodically send the correct dc level of the estimate to the receiver. The second method employed a leaky integrator, and the third method used line-to-line interpolation."

 "This paper contains exact expressions for the complete class of uncountably many globally optimal affine Nasb equilibrium strategies for a two-stage two-person nonzero-sum game problem with quadratic objective functionals and with dynamic information for beth players. Existence conditions for each of these Nash equilibrium solutions are derived and it is shown that a recursive Nash solution is not necessarily globally optimal. Cost-uniqueness property of the derived Nash strategies is investigated and it is proven that the game problem under consideration admits a unique Nash cost pair if and only if it can be made equivalent to either a team problem or a zero-sum game. It is also shown that existence conditions of a globally optimal Nash solution will be independent of the parameters characterizing the nonuniques of the Nash strategies only if the game problem can be made equivalent to a team problem."
"The algebraic Riccati equation problem is reformulated so as to yield a simple solution when the system has only real roots, as may occur when using a spatially quantized distributed parameter model. A restriction is also placed on the choice of the synthetic output matrixC."
"Two algorithms for least-squares estimation of parameters of a Hammerstein model are compared. Numerical examples demonstrate that the iterative method of Narendra and Gallman produces significantly smaller parameter covariance and slightly smaller rms error than the noniterative method of Chang and Luus, as expected from an analysis of the parameter estimators. In addition, the iterative algorithm is faster for high-order systems."
  "A new notion of compensator identification, as opposed to the conventional plant identification problem, is introduced in this paper. It is assumed that it is desired to synthesize a robust feedforward-feedback controller for an unknown plant so that asymptotic tracking, in the presence of disturbances, occurs. The only assumptions made regarding the description of the plant model are that 1) the plant is linear and time-invariant and 2) the uncontrolled plant is stable. Note that it is assumed that the order of the plant model is unknown. It is assumed that the control inputs to the plant can be excited, that the outputs of the plant which are desired to be regulated can be measured, and that the class of disturbance inputs and reference inputs is known. In addition, it is also assumed in the feedforward controller case, that the disturbance inputs can be measured and be excited; this assumption is not required in the robust feedback controller case. Necessary and sufficient conditions which allow the robust feedforward-feedback compensator to be synthesized so that the controlled system is stable and so that asymptotic tracking, in the presence of both measurable and unmeasurable disturbances, occurs are obtained. An algorithm which allows the controllers to be synthesized is given. Some numerical examples are included to illustrate the results."
"In view of the particular interest in the problem of reduced-order modeling in recent years, some considerations not sufficiently investigated in current literature are pointed out and a comprehensive set of references is given."
"In the above paper Kashyap and Nasburg introduced canonical forms II and III to represent multivariate systems. The limited informarion estimate to obtain the parameters of the system was presented, in which the system is decomposed by using either of the proposed canonical forms into subsystems. As a result the estimation problem was considerably simplified. In this correspondence, it is observed that the canonical form I which has the smallest number of parameters can be decomposed into subsystems just as well, and that the class of models in canonical form I, which is the usual representation, is wider than canonical forms II or III. The question therefore is: what is the real merit of implementing those new canonical forms II and III?"
"It is shown that the optimal value for the gain of a gradient parameter estimator derived in the above paper is, in general, not optimal, and for a simple example the actual optimal gain is determined."
"A new approach is taken to the problem of tracking a fixed amplitude signal with a Brownian motion phase process. Classically, a first-order phase-lock loop (PLL) is used; here, the problem is treated via estimation of the quadrature signal components. In this space, the state dynamics are linear with white multiplicative noise. Therefore, linear, minimum-variance filters, which have a particularly simple mechanization, are suggested. The resulting error dynamics are linear at any signal/noise (S/N) ratio unlike the classical PLL. During synchronization, and above threshold, this filter with constant gains degrades by 3 percent in output rms phase error with respect to the classical loop. However, up to 80 percent of the maximum possible noise improvement is obtained below threshold where the classical loop is nonoptimum, as demonstrated by a Monte Carlo analysis. Filter mechanizations are presented for beth carrier and baseband operation. An interesting bandpass filter interpretation is given."
"In a recent paper [15] results for the asymptotic stability and exponential stability (with probability one) of a class of continuous parameter stochastic composite systems, with disturbances confined to the sub-system structure, were established. In this short paper these results are extended to allow stability analysis of systems for which stochastic disturbances may not only enter into the subsystem structure but also into the interconnecting structure of composite systems. As in previous related results, the objective is to analyze composite systems in terms of their lower order subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure."
"A new least squares solution for obtaining asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimates of unknown parameters in noisy linear systems is presented. The proposed algorithms are in many ways more advantageous than generalized least squares algorithm. Extensions to on-line and multivariable problems can be easily implemented. Examples are given to illustrate the performance of these new algorithms."
"A procedure is proposed for rapidly fitting a modified cubic approximation to a moving window of equally spaced measurements."
"A method for propagating the square root of the state error covariance matrix in lower triangular form is described. The algorithm can be combined with any triangular square-root measurement update algorithm to obtain a triangular square-root sequential estimation algorithm. The triangular square-root algorithm compares favorably with the convential sequential estimation algorithm with regard to computation time."
"Recent results from decentralized control theory [1] are used to derive conditions for determining when a linear system (C_{P},A_{P}, B_{P}), parameterized byP, is controllable or canonical for all but an exceptional set of values ofP."
 "Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for there to exist a robust controller for a linear, time-invariant, multivariable system (plant) so that asymptotic tracking/regulation occurs independent of input disturbances and arbitrary perturbations in the plant parameters of the system. In this problem, the class of plant parameter perturbations allowed is quite large; in particular, any perturbations in the plant data are allowed as long as the resultant closed-loop system remains stable. A complete characterization of all such robust controllers is made. It is shown that any robust controller must consist of two devices 1) a servocompensator and 2) a stabilizing compensator. The servocompensator is a feedback compensator with error input consisting of a number of unstable subsystems (equal to the number of outputs to be regulated) with identical dynamics which depend on the disturbances and reference inputs to the system. The sorvocompensator is a compensator in its own right, quite distinct from an observer and corresponds to a generalization of the integral controller of classical control theory. The sole purpose of the stabilizing compensator is to stabilize the resultant system obtained by applying the servocompensator to the plant. It is shown that there exists a robust controller for \"almost all\" systems provided that the number of independent plant inputs is not less than the number of independent plant outputs to be regulated, and that the outputs to be regulated are contained in the measurable outputs of the system; if either of these two conditions is not satisfied, there exists no robust controller for the system."
"The decentralized robust control of a completely general servomechanism problem is considered in this paper. Necessary and sufficient conditions, together with a characterization of all decentralized robust controllers which enables asymptotic tracking to occur, independent of disturbances in the plant and perturbations in the plant parameters, and gains of the system, are obtained. A new type of compensator called a decentralized sercocompensator which is quite distinct from an observer is introduced. It is shown that this compensator, which corresponds to an integral controller in classical control theory, must be used in any decentralized servomechanism problem to assure that the controlled system is stabilizable and achieves robust control; in particular, it is shown that a decentralized robust controller of a general servomechanism problem consists of two devices 1) a decentralized servocompensator and 2) a decentralized stabilizing compensator. It is then shown that, under certain mild conditions, there almost always is a solution to the robust decentralized servomechanism problem for any composite system consisting of a number of subsystems interconnected in any arbitrary manner. This last observation has important implications for process control."
"An analytical feedback design technique is presented here for single-input-output processes which are characterized by their rational transfer functions. The design procedure accounts for the topological structure of the feedback system ensuring asymptotic stability for the closed-loop configuration. The plant or process being controlled can be unstable and/or nonminimum phase. The treatment of feedback sensor noise, disturbance inputs, and process saturation is another major contribution of this work. The cornerstone in the development is the selection of a performance index based on sound engineering considerations. It is these considerations, in fact, which ensure the existence of an optimal compensator for the system and make the performance index a natural one for the problem at hand."
"New results for input-output stability of multiple input-multiple output systems, viewed as interconnected systems, are established. In the present approach, which can also be utilized in stabilization and compensation procedures, large-scale systems are analyzed in terms of their subsystems and interconnecting structure. The method advanced is applied to a specific example. The present results differ appreciably from earlier ones by Porter and Michel because they are applicable to a larger class of problems, they are simpler to apply when conicity conditions are used, and in addition to circle criteria, they also utilize Popov-type conditions. The present procedure differs significantly from existing methods concerned with the analysis of systems having several nonlinearities. Many of these earlier results (multidimensional Popov criteria) usually involve frequency dependent test matrices and graphical frequency domain interpretations are generally not possible. The present results require frequency independent test matrices and yield graphical frequency domain interpretations."
"A multilevel feedback control scheme is proposed for optimization of large-scale systems composed of a number of (not necessarily weakly coupled) subsystems. Local controllers are used to optimize each subsystem, ignoring the interconnections. Then, a global controller may be applied to minimize the effect of interconnections and improve the performance of the overall system. At the cost of suboptimal performance, this optimization strategy ensures invariance of suboptimality and stability of the systems under structural perturbations whereby subsystems are disconnected and again connected during operation."
"The use of linear feedback to stabilize the two-degree-of-freedom model of a biped is considered. Linear feedback is used not only for stabilization but also for placing the system poles and for altering the system characteristics. The use of constraints to reduce the number of external inputs required to control the model is investigated. The effect of various linear feedback strategies on the nonlinear model is studied via computer simulation."
"This paper presents new results on the problem of measurement scheduling, sensor location, and design for linear dynamic systems. Both time-invariant and time-varying systems are considered and different norms of the observability and information matrices are maximized with respect to the structural parameters of the system. A close connection is established between these problems and the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theory of experimental design for regression problems. Both randomized and nonrandomized designs are considered. It is shown that the optimal designs obey certain minmax properties that lead to rapidly convergent algorithms. The results are illustrated by an analytical and a numerical example."
"This correspondence presents a new, simple, and unified way of eliminating both types of singularities encountered in the development of Jury's table. In addition, it is shown that the information about the number of roots on the unit circle can be precisely determined."
"A trajectory sensitivity approach is taken to the design of a Kalman filter for a system with uncertain parameters. A two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) is formulated, where the performance index depends on the variances of the parameter deviations. A suboptimal algorithm is also developed. An example shows that estimation errors may be reduced considerably from those generated by a Kalman filter design for the nominal parameter values."
"We consider a class of stochastic linear systems that are subject to jumps of unknown magnitudes in the state variables occurring at unknown times. This model can be used when considering such problems as estimation for systems subject to possible component failures and the tracking of vehicles capable of abrupt maneuvers. Using Kalman-Bucy filtering and generalized likelihood ratio techniques, we devise an adaptive filtering system for the detection and estimation of the jumps. An example that illustrates the dynamical properties of our filtering scheme is discusssed in detail."
"The optimal regulation for stochastic linear systems with adjustable plant parameters is examined and posed as a nonlinear programming problem. A computational procedure built around the generalized reduced gradient algorithm is developed to solve the associated plant-controller design problem. The procedure is illustrated via a lateral autopilot design in which the quality of regulation is improved by approximately 18 percent over that achievable with a nominal fixed plant."
"The practical implementation of adaptive controllers using minicomputers requires algorithms which are both numerically economical and robust. The problem of combined state and parameter estimation for adaptive controllers was originally posed as a nonlinear filtering problem. The only known nonlinear filter which can be practically implemented on a small computer is the extended Kalman filter. The extended Kalman filter, however, often diverges, thus, there is a need for economical, robust parameter-state estimators. A simple suboptimal parameter and state estimator is presented which fills this need. The filter is based on a particular canonical form for the state-space equations of a linear system which allows the parameters and states to be estimated separately using two linear estimators. If an innovations model is used, the steady-state Kalman filter gains can be estimated and thus, during steady-state operation, the estimates of the states can be easily obtained. Numerical exampies are presented which demonstrate the increased robustness and speed of the proposed linear estimator over the extended Kalman filter."
"This correspondence is concerned with estimating a state variable for a discrete-time nonlinear system in the presence of random disturbance and measurement noise. A Bayesian approach is adopted in which the state conditioned upon the available measurement data is computed recursively. The new feature of the present method is that the stochastic differential rules can be applied for deriving the optimal nonlinear filter for a discrete-time system described by difference equations. Based on this estimator, the Kalman-Bucy filter and the Kushner filter are derived by the appropriate procedures."
"It is shown that in solving the equation\\Sigma \\alpha_{ij}(A^{T})^{i}PA^{j} = Qfor the symmetric matrixPthe number of linear equations and unknowns call be reduced from\\frac{1}{2} n(n + 1)to\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)by introducing a skew symmetric matrix. This generalizes earlier results for Lyapunov matrix equations."

"This note generalizes the standard definitions of controllability and observability for linear systems to output-nulling controllability and unknown-input observability. These more general notions have found recent application in linear system theory. Several properties are shown to still hold, including the important property of duality between controllability and observability."

"It is shown that the problem of finding a solutionT(\\lambda), of least McMillan degree, to the transfer matrix equationT_{1}(\\lambda) = T_{2}(\\lambda)T(\\lambda)is in essence equivalent to the problem of finding an (A,B)-invariant subspace of least dimension which contains a given subspace."
"In an earlier publication [1], Vidyasagar proposed to derive a standard Nyquist-type stability criterion [1, theorem 1] from a result about a graphical test developed by Callier and Desoer [2, theorem 2]. The attempt suffers from two major weaknesses which are detailed in the Appendix. Basically, Vidyasagar's concept is correct: namely, it is possible to give a graphical test which relies exclusively on the graph of\\acuteangle (1 + k\\hat{g}(j\\omega)), the phase of the return difference. We give below a correct statement and proof of such a graphical test."
"A simple nonlinear example is presented which shows the well-known iterated batch least-squares and extended sequential estimation algorithms may converge to different estimates. For this example one may even say the extended sequential algorithms converge to the wrong value."

"A method is given for allocating power loads for a system of electric generating units in a way which meets the time-dependent demand and minimizes the sum of the fuel cost and a penalty function for pollution. The method takes into account explicitly the dynamic nature of ambient air pollution which depends on the topography of a region and on the past performance of the system. With suitable and reasonably realistic approximations, the problem is reduced to a linear-quadratic optimal control problem for which a linear feedback control rule is obtained. In addition, a discrete version of the problem is given which has the form of a quadratic programming problem, and thus can accommodate, in a straightforward manner, additional constraints such as fuel limitations and upper bounds on emission."

"A control system is designed and implemented for a test table the motion of which is to track the output of a gyroscope. The process to be controlled is governed by a third-order differential equation with an important nonlinearity due to static friction. Representing the friction as an independent random walk yields a dynamic process amenable to design by methods of linear control theory. An existing design program was used to calculate the compensator transfer function which was realized with standard capacitors, resistors, and operational amplifiers. The compensator was installed in the test table and results in excellent closed-loop system performance."
"An open-loop feedback strategy is proposed for the control of the census of a hospital via the inpatient admission system. A semi-Markov population model is used to derive census forecasts. A suboptimal control is obtained by solving at each period a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. A simulation permits a first evaluation of the proposed strategy as an admission decision rule."
"Optimal preventive maintenance and repairmen policies for a system of machines subject to degradation with age and intermittent breakdowns and repairs are derived using optimal control theory. When this system of machines forms part of a dynamic process control system, a method of obtaining optimal closed-loop control law is indicated."
"The problem of designing a static state feedback controller which matches a given multivariable system to a desired ideal system (model) is treated. The system under control is assumed in state space form while the model is assumed in transfer matrix form. An algorithm is developed which separates the conditions which must be satisfied by the system under control and the model to be matched from the equations which must be solved to find the gains of the feedback controller. Two examples are included."
"The speeds of the adaptive response of Lyapunov-designed adaptive systems are related to some extent to the degree of stability of the system. A generalized quadratic Lyapunov function is constructed to allow several new adaptive algorithms to be synthesized. The new algorithms each improve the degree of stability over previously reported adaptive algorithms. A root-locus analysis substantiates the improvement in response speed. While the framework for this short paper is that of full-state model-reference adaptation, the synthesis is applicable to systems employing output measurement, such as reduced-order model-reference systems [5] or an adaptive observer [20]."
"In this correspondence, the problem of fixed-interval smoothing of linear discrete systems with multiple time delays is considered. An algorithm is developed which in certain cases is computationally more efficient than the one obtained through the state augmentation method."
"Vector Lyapunov functions are used in the stability analysis of large-scale stochastic systems described by Itô differential equations (with stochastic disturbances in the subsystems and in the interconnecting structure). Sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability and exponential stability with probability 1 and in probability are established, in all cases the objective is the same: to analyze large-scale systems in terms of their lower order (and simpler) subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure. Use of the method presented makes it often possible to circumvent difficulties usually encountered when the Lyapunov method is applied to high-dimensional systems and to systems with complicated interconnecting structure. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the present approach, a specific example is considered."
"The method of approximation in the norm is used to design a linear predictor for the output of a complex linear system at a given future time. It is shown that the computed output is an optimal linear transformation of some variables denoted the \"most important\" states of the system. The proposed method allows to obtain the system output prediction as a signal belonging to a guaranteed uncertainty tube."

"The optimization of nonlinear systems subject to linear terminal state variable constraints is considered. A technique for solving this class of problems is proposed that involves a piecewise polynomial parameterization of the system variables. The optimal control problem is thereby reduced to a linearly constrained parameter optimization problem which can be solved efficiently using the quadratically convergent Gold-farb-Lapidus algorithm. Illustrative numerical examples are presented."
"By employing two reference frames for the motor equations, a sixth-order transfer function is developed for a two-phase servomotor, taking fully into account the electromechanical transients, rotor current and speed feedback, and unbalanced excitation with the reference winding excited continuously. In applications, the model can readily be approximated by a fourth-order transfer function. A numerical example illustrates the differences with several transfer functions available in the literature."
"Stochastic differential equations for the linear fixed point, fixed interval, and fixed lag smoothing problems are derived using the martingale representation theory."
"In an estimation problem the statistics of various random processes involved may not be known exactly. Using linear state space modeling techniques, this lack of information can often be represented by allowing certain system model parameters to assume any of a finite set of possible known values with corresponding a priori known probabilities. In this short paper a recursive minimum variance estimator, restricted to be a linear function of the observation data sequence, is obtained for an estimation problem which can be described by a linear discrete time system model with uncertain parameters; all initial information relative to these uncertain parameters is utilized by the estimator. The estimation error covariance matrix, in a recursive form, is also obtained. An example is given to illustrate the usefulness of this estimator."
"A theory of Luenberger type of observers for time-delay systems based on spectral decomposition techniques is developed. The stability, of the observer is rigorously established and the observer equations are reduced to an integro-differential form. The computational aspects are discussed and the difficulty is traced to that of computing eigenvalues of delay differential equations. Formal structural similarities of Kalman filters for delay systems and the observer developed here are indicated."

"Near-time-optimum control procedures for the rotational motion of a spinning symmetric spacecraft are obtained with the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory. It is shown in this correspondence that the near-optimum controls are simple to implement and that the performance loss can be limited by a suitable selection of system parameters. Results have been obtained for satellites with constant and variable spin speed."
"Optimal recursive estimates are derived for a class of non-Gaussian nonlinear systems using a discrete approximation of the probability density function of the measurement noise."
"The linear finite-dimensional system\\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t) + u(t)cannot, by linear delay feedback controls of the formu(t)= \\sum \\min{i = 1}\\max{m}[B_{i}x(tih) + C_{i}\\dot{x}(t-ih)], be controlled such thatx(t) \\equiv 0fortlarge enough. A simple and presumably practical way is proposed of circumventing this limitation of standard delay feedback design. This method consists in augmenting the original system by a linear system of the same dimension and using linear feedback from the augmented system. Parameters in the delay feedback control laws are determined which yield function space null controllability in minimal time."
"The relationship between the switching angle and the output torque of a step motor is derived, and the optimal angle, which maximized the output torque, is found. The resulting maximum torque, which varies with the velocity, is an upper limit for the torque that can be generated by the step motor."
"A new criterion for input-output stability of multiloop systems is presented. The setting proposed by Zames is employed and emphasis is placed upon the multiloop structure of the system. The criterion is derived from the result by Zames and includes, as a special case, some of the previous results about interconnected systems reported by Tokumaru et al., Porter and Michel, and Cook. The criterion is especially useful when applied to multiinput-multioutput feedback systems which have a time-invariant linear system in the forward path and a time-varying nonlinear diagonal gain in the feedback path. It is simpler than, and in certain cases sharper than, the standard multivariable circle criterion."

  "The purpose of this work is to formulate, analyze, and resolve stability of competitive equilibrium under structural perturbations in the Hicks-Metzler algebraic setting. Nonstationary models are introduced for multiple markets of commodities or services, to consider a reduction in the number of commodities, nonlinear saturation phenomena, changing of a commodity from a substitute to a complement to another commodity, time-varying shifts in excess demand, etc. By using the modern mathematical methods of the comparison principle and the vector Lyapunov function, a decomposition-aggregation approach is proposed to treat large market systems. A commodity can be split up into a number of subcommodities, or several commodities can be combined into one composite commodity. Then, a low-order linear aggregate market model can be formed which represents the price adjustment mechanism for the composite commodities. Stability of the aggregate model implies stability of the original nonlinear and nonstationary market, and stability is connective. That is, stability of the aggregate model implies stability of each subset of markets for the composite commodities. This is remarkable in that it shows a wide tolerance of stable market models to nonlinear nonstationary phenomena and, therefore, inherent robustness of competitive equilibrium in economic systems."
"We present the models describing a problem of dynamic file allocation in a network of interacting computers and use dynamic programming to solve for the optimal strategies. The problem is treated for the case when the rates of the file requests are known in advance, as well as when only prior statistics is available for these rates. A separation theorem between estimation of the rates and the optimal control is proven, similar to Wonham's separation theorem for linear Gaussian models."
"This paper considers some aspects of a gradient projection method proposed by Goldstein [1], Levitin and Polyak [3], and more recently, in a less general context, by McCormick [10]. We propose and analyze some convergent step-size rules to be used in conjunction with the method. These rules are similar in spirit to the efficient Armijo rule for the method of steepest descent and under mild assumptions they have the desirable property that they identify the set of active inequality constraints in a finite number of iterations. As a result the method may be converted towards the end of the process to a conjugate direction, quasi-Newton or Newton's method, and achieve the attendant superlinear convergence rate. As an example we propose some quadratically convergent combinations of the method with Newton's method. Such combined methods appear to be very efficient for large-scale problems with many simple constraints such as those often appearing in optimal control."
"The model reference adaptive system approach together with the positivity lemma for time varying discrete systems are used to construct recursive identifiers with a parallel adjustable model, using adaptation algorithms having a decreasing gain. Identification of single input-single output systems and of multivariable systems is discussed. The identifiers assure an asymptotic unbiased parameter estimation in the presence of noise obscured measurements. Experimental results obtained from simulated data and from the identification of a paper machine are presented. The comparison with the performances of other identification methods is discussed."
"This paper presents an algorithm for minimizing an objective function subject to conventional inequality constraints as well as to inequality constraints of the functional type:\\max_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} \\phi(z,\\omega) \\leq 0, where Ω is a closed interval inR, andz \\in R^{n}is the parameter vector to be optimized. The algorithm is motivated by a standard earthquake engineering problem and the problem of designing linear multivariable systems. The stability condition (Nyquist criterion) and disturbance suppression condition for such systems are easily expressed as a functional inequality constraint."

It also briefly indicates some potential areas of applications of stochastic control theory to problems in economic theory and regulation of economics."
"This paper extends the results of Lin on structural controllability of single-input linear systems to multiinput linear systems. An interesting byproduct of this extension is an application of generic analysis to the determination of the rank of a structured matrix. The algorithm for computing generic rank is applicable to various problems other than the controllability problem studied here."
 "The growth path of a mixed, open urban economy is considered, which is linked to the national economy through labor flows in the direction of higher per capita consumption. In the private sector, profit maximizing firms produce output, individually hiring labor but jointly using infrastructure with public good characteristics. The public sector chooses a taxation policy for dividing output into consumption and infrastructural investments to maximize the current value of future per capita felicity. Urban growth paths are derived, and public sector policies regarding the provision of infrastructure and the control of labor migration are analyzed."

"This paper presents a procedure for designing a rent control schedule which achieves reduction in rents while it simultaneously discourages under-maintenance leading to deterioration of the housing stock. The focus of the procedure is to understand the reaction of a profit-maximizing landlord to a given rent schedule and then to design the schedule so as to induce a favorable reaction. This is formulated mathematically as an inverse problem of optimal control."
"Sufficient conditions are derived for the nonoccurrence of limit cycles in a class of nonlinear multivariable feedback systems, where the nonlinearities are single-valued, time-invariant, and slope-restricted. The conditions involve the transfer function matrix of the linear part of the system, and can be interpreted graphically in terms of Nyquist diagrams."
"For a linear stochastic system minimizing the expected value of an exponential function of a quadratic yields a control law for the terminal guidance problem which operates linearly on the estimated states. The control gains are explicit functions of the error variance in estimating the state. It is shown that the control gains can be calculated by combining a precalculated matrix determined by a backward integration in time with the error variance calculated forward in time. If the measurement variance is estimated in real time, then the error variance must also be calculated in real time. The control scheme will then be adaptive reflecting the estimated quality of the information. The adaptive control scheme is applied to the terminal phase of a homing missile where the measurement variance is estimated on-line."
"The problem of minimum-energy control of linear systems with linear functional constraints on the output is considered from a spline-theoretic viewpoint. It is shown that constrained minimum-energy control and spline interpolation are dual projection problems: if the given system is driven by the minimum-energy control, the system output will be the spline that interpolates the output constraints. This duality result is used to obtain a simple formula for the exact optimal control under very general constraints."
"An extremum \"on-off\" controller whose detailed description is given here is designed to continuously operate an industrial process at the extreme value of the process output. The process investigated consists of the following in cascade: a pure time delay, a parabolic function, and a first-order lag. A simple method is presented for selection of the three controller parameters, a gain, a velocity constant, and a dead time. The gain and the velocity constant are chosen so as to obtain a desired average output for the oscillation cycle. The main advantages of the controller designed are speed in reaching the extremum and low sensitivity to disturbances (because of low value of gain). A step-by-step procedure for the control system design is given."

An illustrative example is provided."

"This correspondence discusses the application of an eigenvalue sensitivity method [1] to a linear, time-invariant model of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) manufactured by General Atomic. It is shown that for this type of system with distinct eigenvalues, a relation can be obtained between the solutions to the classical sensitivity. equation and the eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivities. This relation indicates that the eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivities are more fundamental indicators of parametric effects than the solutions of the sensitivity. equation. A Fortran program (SENSIT) was developed to implement the algorithms required for eigenvalue sensitivity calculations. This program was applied to a large scale (58 state) linear, time invariant model of the HTGR operating under closed-loop control."

"Effective enforcement of no parking regulations, an essential operation in urban areas, is labor intensive and thus costly. Efficient, implementable enforcement strategies that can raise and keep compliance at a desired high level are needed. It is the objective of this work to determine such strategies. First a model relating enforcement (input) to compliance (output) was obtained on the basis of experimental data; its form is that of a homogeneous bilinear Markov process. Then several optimization problems that reflect different operating conditions were formulated and the corresponding enforcement strategies were derived via dynamic programming. Finally, simulations were used to analyze the practical implications of the results."
 "The solution of variational problems by singular perturbation methods is discussed. In addition to the benefits of order reduction, these methods also can serve as practical devices for treating the singularities arising in problems where the control appears linearly and/or in state-constrained control problems. Furthermore, approximate feedback solutions can be derived for problem formulations that currently result in a nonlinear two-point boundary value problem. To illustrate an application, a feedback solution for aircraft, three-dimensional minimum lime turns is derived and discussed. Numerical results are presented for an F-106 and an F-4E aircraft."
 "In many modern-day control problems encountered in the fluid, petroleum, power, gas and paper industries, cross coupling (interaction) between controlled and manipulated variables can be so severe that any attempt to employ single-loop controllers results in unacceptable performance. In all these situations, any workable control strategy most take into account the true multivariable nature of the plant and address itself directly to the design of a compatible multivariable controller. Any practical design technique most be able to cope with load disturbance, plant saturation, measurement noise, process lag, sensitivity and also incorporate suitable criteria delimiting transient behavior and steady-state performance. These difficulties, when compounded by the fact that many plants (such as chemical reactors) are inherently open-loop unstable have hindered the development of an inclusive frequency-domain analytic design methodology. However, a solution based on a least-square Wiener-Hopf minimization of an appropriately chosen cost functional is now available. The optimal controller obtained by this method guarantees an asymptotically stable and dynamical closed-loop configuration irrespective of whether or not the plant is proper, stable, or minimum-phase and also permits the stability margin of the optimal design to be ascertained in advance. The main purpose of this paper is to lay bare the physical assumptions underlying the choice of model and to present an explicit formula for the optimal controller."
"Certain results paralleling those of Bailey and Ramapriyan [1] for linear dynamic systems are presented for nonlinear systems. For \"weakly perturbed\" systems certain suboptimal controls are shown to be stabilizing and upper and lower bounds on the suboptimality are investigated."

"Several facets of the automatic lateral control of individual ground vehicles are considered in detail. First, a path-dependent coordinate system for describing vehicle motion is defined, and the availability of motion quantities for control purposes is specified. Second, the lateral dynamics of a typical U.S. passenger sedan are empirically obtained and validated with data from full-scale studies. Third, various designs, in which different types of compensation are employed, are evaluated in terms of specified requirements and attractive candidates are specified. Finally, several controller designs were tested under full-scale conditions wherein a wire-reference configuration and a dual-mode test vehicle were employed. The latter was automatically steered on both straight and curving roads at speeds up to 35.8 m/s (80 mph). In one typical case, the maximum tracking error observed was 0.0635 m and occurred both when a sidewind was present and when the vehicle entered a curving section of roadway. Excellent lateral control-close tracking, good insensitivity to disturbance forces, and a comfortable ride-can be obtained using a relatively simple controller."
"A decision-theoretic formulation is given for the problem of classifying an unknown nonlinear stochastic system into one of M classes when only input-output measurements are available. This leads directly to a pattern recognition solution for the problem, and Bayes-Risk theory yields the likelihood-ratio test for class determinations. Parameterizations which yield an implicit description for unknown nonlinear systems are considered, and the theoretical likelihood ratio is related to these parameterizations. The problem of initial feature selection is considered in terms of a parameter vector, and in terms of a quasimoment expansion, both of which require no a priori knowledge of the system. Certain experimental results are cited."

"This short paper presents an application of linear regulator theory to the control of multilocomotive powered unit trains. Locomotives are taken to be situated at the front, middle, and end of the train. Their feedback controls are linear functions of the deviations in locomotive schedule velocity and the coupler forces around the locomotive. The controls are designed by assuming that various locomotive-gondola car combinations are detached from the train. Computer simulation results are presented for a 62 car train traversing an undulating grade. The controls obtained are for the propulsion of the train as problems associated with braking are not considered. The control algorithm used in this short paper, where only local measurements are used for control, is an example of a decentralized control system."
"A necessary and sufficient condition for integrator decoupling ofp-inputm-output multivariable control systems by the restricted state feedback control law,u = GFx + G\\upsilon, is established."
"In this short paper we consider three closely related aspects of large-scale systems: decentralization, stabilization, and estimation. A method is proposed to decompose a large linear system into a number of interconnected subsystems with decentralized (scalar) inputs or outputs. The procedure is preliminary to the hierarchic stabilization and estimation of linear systems and is performed on the subsystem level A multilevel control scheme based upon the decomposition-aggregation method is developed for stabilization of input-decentralized linear systems. Local linear feedback controllers are used to stabilize each decoupled subsystem, while global linear feedback controllers are utilized to minimize the coupling effect among the subsystems. Systems stabilized by the method have a tolerance to a wide class of nonlinearities in subsystem coupling and high reliability with respect to structural perturbations. The proposed output-decentralization and stabilization schemes can be used directly to construct asymptotic state estimators for large linear systems on the subsystem level. The problem of dimensionality is resolved by constructing a number of low-order estimators, thus avoiding a design of a single estimator for the overall system."
"The asymptotic loci of the closed-loop poles of the multivariable time-invariant linear regulator are considered as the weight on the input in the criterion approaches zero. It is proved that those poles that go to infinity group into several Butterworth configurations of different orders and with different radii. It is furthermore shown that the first-order patterns are easily explicitly determined. Some examples illustrate the results."
"This short paper studies a particular class of optimization problems dealing with the selection, at each instant of time, of one out of many actuators in order to obtain a determined result. A cost is associated with each actuator. The cost function is the integral of a weighted combination of the achieved accuracy on the state of the system and the control energy. The control energy term depends upon both the selected actuator and the magnitude of the applied control. The problem is to design an optimal actuator selection strategy. The analysis is limited to the class of linear deterministic systems with measurable states. A discrete approach is considered. The analytic solution to this optimization problem is given first. When the number of actuators and the number of stages in the time interval become large the optimal analytic solution requires a considerable combinatorial work; a suboptimal algorithm is then proposed to alleviate this defect."
"This short paper presents a computerized algorithm for the design of compensators for large launch vehicles. The algorithm is applicable to the design of compensators for linear, time-invariant, control systems with a plant possessing a single control input and multioutputs. The achievement of frequency response specifications is cast into a strict constraint mathematical programming format. An improved solution algorithm for solving this type of problem is given, along with the mathematical necessities for application to systems of the above type. A computer program, compensator improvement program (CIP), has been developed and applied to a pragmatic space-industry-related example."
"Finite-difference methods are used to derive lumped state-space models of a diffusion process. The accuracy of the lumped models is primarily determined by the number of intervals used. A refinement of the approximations to the partial derivatives only improves this accuracy to a certain extent. The study also shows that it is important to use smaller intervals near the ends of the rod."
"A general approach for computing the stationary feedback gain of a linear system with specified response characteristic is outlined. The proposed approach can be applied with advantage to the design of multivariable systems as an alternative to the existing methods for design of such systems with specified pole locations."

Sufficient conditions are given for the case where optimization is effected on an instantaneous rather than an integral basis."
 "General continuous time smoothing results for state estimation with interrupted observations are derived. The interruption mechanism is characterized by a jump Markov process taking values 0 or 1. The approach followed for deriving the smoothing estimator is similar to the one used in [1] for the case of filtering where interruption process initial value and the jump instants are treated as the unknown system parameters. Lainiotis's partition theorem is then applied to obtain the desired estimator based on smoothing."

   "The purpose of this correspondence is to show that in certain situations the modification suggested in the above correspondence does not give the correct root distribution and fails to eliminate the singular case. Consequently, the correct modification which can handle these situations also is suggested. Incidentally, an incorrect statement made in the above correspondence is also pointed out."
"When constant output feedback is applied around a linear system with a rational transfer function matrix which may be improper, the closed-loop transfer function matrix is generically proper."
"The notion of steady-state invertibility of a system is introduced, which is concerned about the problem of being able to find an input so that the output of a stable system is asymptotically equal to a specified output of a certain class of functions. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for a linear time-invariant system to be steady-state invertible. Application of these results is then made to find necessary and sufficient conditions for a feedforward controller to exist for a general linear time-invariant system, so that asymptotic tracking, in the presence of a general class of measurable disturbances occurs. Explicit feedforward controllers which will accomplish this are obtained. Properties of the steady-state invertibility condition are then obtained; in particular, it is shown that a system is \"almost always\" steady-state invertible if the number of plant inputs is not less than the number of outputs; if the number of plant inputs is less than the number of outputs, then a system is \"almost never\" steady-state invertible. It is then shown that a system which is minimum phase and which has at least the same number of inputs as outputs is always steady-state invertible."
"A self-contained algebraic derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a multiinput system with a fixed zero structure to be structurally controllable is given. In addition, a new recursive test for determining structural controllability which utilizes only Boolean operations is obtained."
"This short paper presents a technique to convert a well-formed system of linear variable difference equations to a corresponding system of state equations. The technique applies to both causal and noncausal systems. The resulting state-representation is in the observer version of the Luenberger canonical form."
"An estimation-detection scheme is proposed for the estimation of signals with unknown parameters. The scheme is illustrated by considering the case of a signal with unknown but bounded variance. Two sets of bounds are used to determine two regions of signal uncertainty, and different linear estimators are used for each region. A detector is then used to select the appropriate estimator. Since no a priori information is assumed on the unknown parameters a weighted minimax criterion is used to optimize the detector and the estimators."
"Sequential estimators are derived for suboptimal adaptive estimation of the unknown a priori state and observation noise statistics simultaneously with the system state. First- and second-order moments of the noise processes are estimated based on state and observation noise samples generated in the Kalman filter algorithm. A limited memory algorithm is developed for adaptive correction of the a priori statistics which are intended to compensate for time-varying model errors. The algorithm provides improved state estimates at little computational expense when applied to an orbit determination problem for a near-earth satellite with significant modeling errors."
"The methods of system identification due to Shinbrot, Perdreauville and Goodson, Fairman and Shen, and Diamessis belong to a class of techniques based on the idea that a linear operation on system equations leads to a set of simultaneous equations solvable for the unknown parameters. These methods have so far been able to treat problems of linear time invariant, time-varying, nonlinear, and distributed parameter systems without lags. This short paper extends the capability of the class of methods to cover time-lag systems. The extension is illustrated with reference to one of the methods that employs Poisson moment functionals. Illustrative examples include linear time invariant, time-varying, and non-linear systems each with a lag."
"The expectation of a particular class of nonquadratic performance criterion involving even powers of the state variables up to sixth order is minimized, over an infinite horizon, subject to a linear stochastic system. The process noise is composed of both additive white noise and state dependent white noise processes. The resulting controller is composed of a linear and cubic function of the state. Furthermore, this controller depends upon the noise variances of both the additive and state dependent noise processes. For partially observable systems with no state dependent noise, similar results as the completely observable system are implied by the separation theorem. For state dependent noise alone, a stochastic Lyapunov function is obtained from which simple probability bounds for the trajectory to exit from a given region of the state space are determined."
"Generalized Bezoutian and Sylvester matrices are defined and discussed in this short paper. The relationship between these two forms of matrices is established. It is shown that the McMillan degree of a real rational function can be ascertained by checking the rank of either one of these generalized matrices formed using a polynomial matrix fraction decomposition of the prescribed transfer function matrix. Earlier established results by Rowe and Munro are obtained as a special case. Several theorems related to the rank testing and other properties of the generalized matrices are discussed and various research problems are listed in the conclusion."
"A new form of adaptive observer which is guaranteed to be globally stable via hyperstability theories is presented. Its main advantage over existing designs is that asymptotic unbiased estimates are obtained in the presence of output noise. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the performance of this observer."
"We discuss the transient behavior of a delay-locked loop which is designed to generate a delay-error signal that is proportional to the difference in the autocorrelation function of the input signal at two points separated by a fixed time2\\tau_{1}. When the input signal is a sine wave, we present an exact solution which shows that the system is stable and achieves a delay lock with an ambiguity of an integral number of periods. The second input considered is that of a stationary, ergodic, and band-limited Gaussian signal. In this case we present an approximate analysis which predicts that for times long compared to the inverse bandwidth of the random signal that the delay error is log-normally distributed. For this case we develop the almost sure sample stability criterion [1]. When this criterion is met, the system sample solutions are stable with probability one independant of the system amplification. We also develop stability criteria which limit the system amplification for stability of the first and second moments of the time delay."
"Compatibility of the observer designed for a linear time-invariant system is discussed and a class of systems to which a given observer is compatible is explicitly stated. This class gives allowable variations of system parameters such that the designed observer is still compatible to the system when the system changes its characteristics. An application to the regulator problem is described briefly."

"The steady-state error of the fading memory filter is studied for stable, two-dimensional models with an uncertainty in the form of a constant, unknown control input. For a set of these models, it is observed that any age-weighting of the data can cause an error greater than that of the Kalman filter. This contradicts previous assumptions about the fading memory filter."
"Samples of a signal are observed with bounded errors. In this correspondence a simple and direct solution to the problem of constructing a smooth curve based on these observations is given. The smoothness of a curve is considered proportional to the energy in the second derivative of the signal."
"In continuous-time linear stochastic control with a fixed structure, reduced-order, dynamic compensator one obtains a quasisingular problem whereby part of the structure is arbitrary. The dual of this problem in discrete time is considered with a more general formulation. Using a quadratic performance index, the Hamiltonian for obtaining the necessary conditions is obtained which may be used to define the optimal linear reduced-order dynamic compensator and the controller gain. It is shown that the discrete problem does not have the quasisingular property of the continuous-time case as is seen by consideration of the Hamiltonian."
"An accelerometer can be constructed using a radioactive proof mass, the position of which can be determined on the basis of the difference between the mean number of emitted charged particles detected at opposite walls when the proof mass is not centered. If the emission rate is relatively small, however, the mean counting rate is very noisy; satisfactory operation requires optimum signal processing. The control system, designed by linear stochastic control theory, generates forces that tend to keep the proof mass centered between walls of the instrument and simultaneously produces an estimated acceleration output. The Poisson-type noise of the pickoff is approximated by Gaussian noise; the acceleration input is modeled as a random walk. It is found by simulation that for an instrument with 1.0 inch spacing between the walls, the proof mass excursion can be confined to a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.36 inch in a severe acceleration environment. The accelerometer output tracks a constant input without error and, when the input acceleration has a random component, the rms error is of the order of ten percent of the random component."
"The control of discrete time nonlinear stochastic systems under ann-step-delay sharing pattern is considered. Nonclassical separation properties are derived. It is shown that only the \"common data\" to the controllers are to be used for estimation purposes. Furthermore, for LQG systems with a delayed sharing information pattern, the best linear controller is shown to obey a separation principle."
"In this short paper conventional observers for linear time-invariant systems are shown to be structurally inadequate from a sensitivity standpoint. It is proved that if a linear dynamic system is to provide observer action despite arbitrary small perturbations in a specified subset of its parameters, it must 1) be a closed-loop system, i.e., be driven by the observer error, 2) possess redundancy, i.e., the observer must be generating, implicitly or explicitly, at least one linear combination of states that is already contained in the measurements, and 3) contain a perturbation-free model of the portion of the system observable from the external input to the observer. The procedure for design of \"robust\" observers possessing the above structural features is established and discussed."
"Weak and strong max-min controllability for a two player (time-varying) linear control system are defined. It is proved that the two concepts are equivalent."
"This correspondence considers the problem of modeling linear time-invariant systems by linear systems of low order. A new method is proposed here based on the quadratic criterion which evaluates an equation error, not an output error. The minimization of an equation error leads to a linear problem whereas the output error leads to a nonlinear problem."
"This correspondence deals with stochastic stability for a multiloop nonlinear system and gives a theorem for the system to be asymptotically stable in the large with probability one."
"It is known [2],[3] that a large class of instrumental variable estimators for autoregressive moving average system parameters are strongly consistent. In this correspondence this class is described and is denoted byS. Then sufficient conditions are given for each member of the classSto be asymptotically normal. These conditions are as follows: 1) the unobserved noise process\\upsilondisturbing the output measurements of the given system is a white noise process; and 2)\\upsilonis independent of the observed input processu. It is further shown that under the same conditions the (strongly consistent) least squares estimator is asymptotically normal and possesses an (asymptotic) estimation error covariance matrix that bounds from below the set of covariance matrices of the classS."

The controllability matrix for these systems is defined, and the necessary and sufficient condition for relative controllability of the considered systems are derived. In the second part the problem of minimum energy control is studied, and the explicit formula for control law is also given."
"In this note general backward Markovian models for second. order stochastic processes are derived by simple backward differentiation of the \"partitioned\" algorithms. These backward models are equivalent to the forward process models in the sense that when solved in the backward direction they yield the same state covariance as the forward model. The general backward models are of theoretical interest as well as of computational importance in several applications."
"It is shown how the well-known Hankel matrix associated with a polynomialf(x)can be employed to obtain information on the location of the zeros off(x)in a given half plane and in particular to obtain a test for aperiodicity off(x)."
"This short paper presents a number of results which characterize the input-output response of a class of nonlinear multivariable systems. A rather general class of nonlinear multivariable systems is considered and a variety of input functions is allowed. Particular conditions are developed which guarantee that the error between the input function and the output response 1) is bounded, 2) tends to a constant value, and 3) tends to zero. The results are of special interest since they can be interpreted as defining a limited form of \"superposition principle\" for the nonlinear systems considered."

"This short paper considers the parameter identification problem of general discrete-time, nonlinear, multiple input-multiple output dynamic systems with Gaussian, white distributed measurement errors. Knowledge of the system parameterization is assumed to be known. Regions of constrained maximum likelihood (CML) parameter identifiability are established. A computation procedure employing interval arithmetic is proposed for finding explicit regions of parameter identifiability for the case of linear systems."
"The singular control test which is useful for determining if the optimal periodic control is superior to the optimal steady control is presented in its general form. Then the relation of the singular control test to the π-test which is known as a frequency domain approach is clarified."
"Corresponding to a processx(.)with a known state model propagating in growing time, we obtain a processx_{r}(.), statistically equivalent tox(.)up to second-order properties but with a state model propagating in reversed time. This result is exploited to obtain recursive linear least-squares estimation algorithms that evolve backwards in time. The reversed-time model is shown to be closely related to the system adjoint of the original state model. Some operator-theoretic consequences are also noted."
"In this note an explicit expression is derived specifying the minimal number of parameters by which a given linear dynamic multivariable system may be described."
"For a class of infinite time linear quadratic games it is shown that an appropriate solution of an algebraic Riccati type equation determines the value of the game but not necessarily any equilibrium strategies. In the case of nonexistence of equilibrium strategies, ε-optimal strategies are constructed through the solutions of a differential Riccati equation."
"In this note it is shown that if a distributed parameter system of parabolic type is controllable by distributed controls then it is also controllable by a scanning control, i.e., a single point control that can be amplitude modulated and deflected by a scanning device."
"A design procedure for low-order compensators is presented which attempts to use available system and dynamic compensator outputs to obtain a least-squares fit to the optimal full-state gain. The procedure is shown to converge and, at least for the examples presented, produces results at least good enough to serve as a starting point for a fixed-structure optimization procedure."
"The problem of optimal output feedback is investigated for linear constant multivariable systems with quadratic performance measures which depend on the unknown initial state. A generalized class of performance measures including worst case and uniformly distributed initial states is defined, so that the effect of the initial states can be varied by specifying a single parameter. Expressions are given for the gradient of the cost to facilitate the calculation of sensitivities and the optimal feedback matrix."
"A procedure is derived for stabilizing linear constant discrete systems which is a discrete analog of the extended Bass algorithm for stabilizing linear constant continuous systems. The procedure offers a method for constructing a stabilizing feedback without the computational difficulty of raising the unstable open-loop response matrix to powers thus making the method attractive for high order or poorly conditioned systems."
    "Motivated by the complexity and the large quantity of on-line operations required for nonlinear filtering problems, observers for nonlinear stochastic systems are constructed based on a Lyapunov-like method. Sufficient conditions on the structure of a nonlinear stochastic system for the existence of an exponentially bounded observer are given. These conditions can be applied off-line. The stabilization of unstable nonlinear stochastic systems using observer feedback are investigated. Sufficient conditions to stabilize cascaded control and observer in a feedback arrangement are given."
"In this paper we discuss certain geometrical aspects of linear systems which, even though they arise in the case of single input-single output systems, do not seem to have been explicitly recognized and studied before. We show, among other things, that the set of minimal, single input-single output, linear systems of degreen, when topologized in the obvious way, consists ofn + 1connected components. The Cauchy index (equivalently, the signature of the Hankel matrix) characterizes the components and the geometry of each component is investigated. We also study the effect of various constraints such as asking that the system be stable or minimum phase."
"New stability results for a large class of interconnected dynamical systems (also called composite systems or large-scale systems) described on Banach spaces are established. In the present approach, the objective is always the same: to analyze large-scale systems in terms of their lower order and simpler subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure. The present results provide a systematic procedure of analyzing hybrid dynamical systems (i.e., systems that are described by a mixture of different types of equations). To demonstrate the method of analysis advanced, two specific examples are considered."
"A method for identifying the transition, control, and noise covariance matrices of a linear discrete-time dynamic system is presented. It is shown that the identification problem can be uncoupled, in the sense that each of the above matrix types can be identified independently of errors that may exist in any of the other matrices. This uncoupling can provide computational efficiency since the matrices involved are of lower order and typically the number of computations increases as the square of the order. A Kalman filter, predicated on the best available knowledge of system parameters, is constructed. The transition and control matrices are identified by requiring that the mean of the measurement residual sequence be zero. Following this, identification of the noise covariance matrices can be accomplished by requiring that the residuals be time-wise uncorrelated. An adaptive stochastic approximation algorithm is used to iteratively adjust the system parameters so that the above requirements are satisfied. Results of applying the method to a numerical example are presented."
"The strong consistency of a general class of prediction error identification methods for stationary stochastic processes is demonstrated. In particular, the strong consistency of the maximum likelihood method for stationary Gaussian processes [4], [5] and of the quadratic loss prediction error method for stationary stochastic processes [1]-[3] follow as special cases of the general result."
"The realization problem of two-dimensional linear filters is approached from a system theoretic point of view. The input-output behavior of such a system is defined by formal power series in two variables, and a Nerode state space is constructed. This state space is, in general, infinite dimensional. If the power series is rational, the dynamics of the filter is described by updating equations on finite-dimensional local state space. The notions of local reachability and observability are defined in a natural way and an algorithm for obtaining a reachable and observable realization is given. In general, local reachability and observability do not imply the minimality of the realization."
"This short paper considers the properties of singularly perturbed systems with white noise input. The theory of singular perturbations is then applied to the filtering problem for such systems. The resulting filter may be approximately decomposed into two filters in different time scales yielding the estimates of the slow-mode and the fast-mode states."
"In a differential game or in the worst case design of an uncertain system, a saddle point solution may not exist. In such cases a rational optimality criterion is minmax. This short paper presents a sufficient condition for a control to be an open-loop minmax control. The use of the condition is illustrated with examples."
"In this short paper the Bayesian estimation of parameters of discrete time, linear, finite-dimensional stochastic systems is discussed. Upper bounds for the estimator mean-square error are obtained under the assumption of a finite parameter set. Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for exponential convergence of the Bayesian estimate to the true parameter values in the mean-square error sense for systems with measurements which are stationary Gaussian random processes. The conditions for convergence are given in terms of a finite set of signal model Markov parameters. The performance results for parameter estimation are shown to yield bounds on the performance of the nonlinear state estimators for the class of signal models under discussion."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
   "Deterministic and stochastic control problems are examined for a broad class of nonlinear dynamic systems with quadratic cost criteria. The systems considered are partially observed continuous-time stochastic process, and are incrementally conic in the sense that, when modeled by Itô differential equations, they contain drift coefficients that are jointly linear in state and control to within a uniformly Lipschitz residual. For deterministic problems, upper bounds are derived on the cost incurred by linear state-feedback control laws, and lower bounds are established on the performance attainable by any control law. For stochastic problems, upper bounds are found on the performance of simple, separated estimator-controller designs involving linear feedback of an easily-implemented, suboptimum estimate of the state, while a lower bound is determined on the performance attainable by any causal control law in a broad admissible class. The bounds share similar structural properties and computational requirements with the exact solution to linear regulator problems. The stochastic bounds owe much of their simplicity to the use of the control-law independent bounds on estimation performance derived in earlier companion papers. All the bounds coverge with vanishing nonlinearity (vanishing Lipschitz constants) to the optimum performance for the nominal linear system. Consequently, the bounds are asymptotically tight and the simple designs studied are asymptotically optimal with vanishing nonlinearity."
"Exclusive concern with mean utility has often masked the intrinsically probabilisitic nature of the performance of an optimally controlled stochastic system. For a class of linear jump parameter systems, an algorithm is presented for evaluating the stationary probability distribution of the utility function for the optimal closed-loop system."
"In this paper a \"max-min controllability\" concept for a situation in which two linear control systems are in conflict is introduced and characterized. This concept is employed in solving a max-min linear-quadratic control problem with terminal state constraints and the relationship with differential game theory is discussed."
 "A theorem in the above paper,[1] giving sufficient conditions for the local Pareto optimality, is shown to be incorrect by a counter-example and a revision of its proof. Moreover, an alternative formulation of this theorem is suggested."
"Connections between dead-beat control strategies and optimal control policies for linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems are established. The performance index of the system is quadratic and only the terminal state of the system is penalized. An explicit solution to the singular Riccati equation, associated with this optimization problem, is given. Properties of the time-variable gain matrices, generating the optimal cantrol policy, are presented. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for each of these gain matrices to be a time-invariant deadbeat controller are given."
"This correspondence presents a comparative study of three methods for the numerical solution of the matrix Lyapunov equation. The test case is a 24th-order system with highly underdamped eigenvalues and a rather high degree of stiffness. The conclusions favor a method by Bartels and Stewart based on a reduction to Schur form of theAmatrix."

"Generalized partitioned solutions (GPS) of Riccati equations (RE) are presented in terms of forward and backward time differential equations that are theoretically interesting, possibly computationally advantageous, as well as provide interesting interpretations of these resuits, e.g., in terms of generalized partial observability and controllability matrices. The GPS are the natural framework for the effective change of initial conditions, and the transformation of backward RE to forward RE and vice-versa. The GPS are given in terms of families of forward or backward RE, and constitute generalizations to time-varying RE of well-known solution algorithms such as theX - Yor Chandrasekhar algorithms. Most importantly, based on the GPS, computationally effective algorithms are obtained for the numerical solution of RE. These partitioned numerical algorithms (PNA) have a decomposed or \"partitioned\" structure, namely, they are given exactly in terms of a set of elemental solutions which are completely decoupled, and as such computable in either a parallel or serial processing mode. Further, the overall solution is given exactly in terms of a simple recursive operation on the elemental solutions. Finally, the PNA for a large class of RE, namely those with periodic or constant matrices, are completely integration-free, other than for a subinterval of the total computation interval, whose length, moreover, can be chosen arbitrarily. Also based on the GPS, a computationally attractive numerical algorithm is obtained for the computation of the steady-state solution of time-invariant RE. This algorithm results from doubling the length of the partitioning interval, and straightforward use of the GPS. The resulting \"doubling\" PNA is fast and is also essentially, integration-free requiring integration only in an initial subinterval, whose length is arbitrary, and subsequently consisting of simple iterative operations at the end of each time-interval which is twice as long as the interval in the previous iterations, i.e., doubling."
"The structure of the separation-theorem solution to the standard linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem does not involve direct output feedback as a consequence of the form of the performance index. It is shown here that the performance index may be generalized in a natural fashion so that the optimal control law involves output feedback [or equivalently, innovations feedthrough (IF)]. Applications where this formulation may be advantageous are indicated through an examination of properties of the IF control law."
"The Riccati equation (RE) plays a fundamental role in optimal control theory, linear estimation, radiative transfer, neutron transport theory, etc. Its effective, numerical solution constitutes the integral prerequisite to the solution of important problems in the above and related fields. A computationally advantageous approach to the solution of matrix Re's is the so-calledx-yor Chandrasekhar algorithm through which the matrix RE is replaced by two coupled differential equations of lesser dimensionality. These previous Chandrasekhar algorithms were, however, restricted to the case of time-invariant models. In this short paper, generalizedx-yor Chandrasekhar algorithms are presented that are applicable to time-varying models as well as time-invariant ones. Backward and forward time differentiations are introduced that readily yield the generalized Chandrasekhar algorithms as well as provide several interesting interpretations of these results. Furthermore, the possible computational advantages, as well as the theoretical significance of the generalized Chandrasekhar algorithms are explored."
"An implicitly defined closed-loop version of the minimum energy-average power constrained optimal regulator for linear systems is introduced and its stability analyzed. A design procedure is developed for synthesizing a state-vector feedback controller which approximates this implicit control law. Simulation results are presented for second-and fourth-order systems which illustrate the restraining effects on the control signal."
"Considered is the asymptotic property of the discrete-time matrix Riccati equation arising in the optimal control of linear systems with a random gain. The instability and stability conditions are derived in terms of the degree of stability of the state transition matrix."
"By utilizing the square root of a matrix approach, a method of generating the solution to a steady-state matrix Riccati type equation (under certain restrictions) is presented. This approach not only yields a closed form expression for the Riccati solution, but also converts the original Riccati equation into other equations which may have numerical or computational advantages. An example is worked out for a second-order case."
"The problem of determining a minimum energy control for a dynamically interconnected set ofpsingle input-single output finite-dimensional linear time-varying dynamical systems, for which the outputs are constrained to assume prescribed values at different points in time, is considered. It is shown that the solution (optimal controller) is obtained by performing a linear operation on an appropriate vector-valued generalized interpolating spline."
"A simplification of the \"separate-bias\" algorithm described in [1] is afforded by the assumption that the covariance matrix of the bias cannot be reduced by the operation of the filter. The calculations are illustrated for a biased sensor governed by a first-order differential equation."

This correspondence considers the properties of anyA \\in \\tilde{a}which will guarantee that ifG = - (A*H + HA), then for any given Hermitian positive definite matrixH, there exists a unique nonsingular Hermitian matrixG. Properties of the eigenvalues ofAandGare established."

New algorithms for constructing reduced order transfer functions are presented. A method of approximating unstable systems with poles in RHP is also proposed resulting in unique transfer functions."
"The use of a parameter identification procedure to detect faults in hardware used to implement a broad class of linear algorithms defined as digital filters is presented.

"A number of new results regarding linear output feedback compensation are presented. In particular, it is shown that the rank of an appropriately defined real matrix Ω represents an upper bound on the number of closed-loop poles which can be completely and arbitrarily assigned via constant gain output feedback. A new bound on the minimum number of dynamical elements required for complete and arbitrary closed-loop pole placement is also defined in terms of the observability index of a certain single-input system."
  "The method of proper equality constraints for obtaining the setPof all Pareto-optimal solutions of a general multiple-objective problem and the setMof all performance index vectors attainable by the Pareto-optimal solutions is presented in this paper. These sets are very useful for those designers, performance analyzers, control agents, and decision makers who are faced with multiple objectives to make appropriate compromises, tradeoffs or choices. That this method is effective for general applications is clearly demonstrated by examples with various kinds of complexity. New necessary and sufficient conditions for Pareto optimality, local Pareto optimality, and local maximal index vectors are also presented. These conditions and the method are useful for both computation and analysis. New observations on a generalized classical Pareto-optimum problem are thereby obtained."
"This paper considers the design of output regulators with the use of approximate models. The measure of the approximation between process and model outputs is represented by a bound in norm of the output error signals and it requires the computation of two numbers. The design is achieved with a rain-max approach where control and error signals are the two antagonists. The min-max solution is obtained as a linear function of the model state (open-loop solution). It is shown that no dosed-loop controls can improve the open-loop min-max performance. Conditions are given so as to preserve the min-max performance by means of proportional feedback of the system's output. In this case the min-max feedback law is obtained (closed-loop solution)."
"A new canonical form for input-output difference (differential) descriptions for linear multivariable systems is proposed. A complete algorithm for the transformation of generical input-output descriptions to the canonical form is also described. This algorithm is based on elementary row operations performed on polynomial matrices."
"An alternative formalism for optimal control of distributed parameter systems is proposed. Necessary conditions for optimality and transversality conditions are developed for a class of distributed-parameter systems. It is shown that when the distributed system becomes a lumped-parameter one, the results obtained become identical to known results of optimal control of lumped systems. The formalism developed is applied to solve a problem of optimal design of a shielding installation around a neutron source."
"For systems with slow and fast subsystems a near-optimum state regulator is composed of two subsystem regulators. Conditions for complete separation of slow and fast regulator designs are formulated. A second-order approximation of the optimal performance is achieved without the knowledge of the small singular perturbation parameter."
"This short paper deals with a control strategy which is considered reasonable for on-line stabilization of the large transient swings that occur in power systems following a major system disturbance. The strategy is compared to other similar strategies both in terms of philosophy and physical application. The example shows the benefit of on-line coordinated application of a dynamic brake and network switching to the transient stability problem when control decisions are implemented using a proper coordinating control strategy."

"Asymptotic stability of linear, time invariant regulators for plants with unknown but bounded parameters are investigated using minimax and extensions of Lyapanov's stability theory. Largest sets of parameters variations are determined such that a linear autonomous system retains stability. Several design procedures are proposed and applied, yielding regulators with satisfactory performance despite large variations in the plant parameters."
"Numerical investigations of the relative efficiency of Riccati versus non-Riccati based approaches to the determination of optimal feedback gains for linear dynamics-quadratic cost control processes over a finite interval are presented. The non-Riccati algorithms used are the so-called generalizedX- Yfunctions [1] or Chandrasekhar-type [2] algorithms. The results of the experiments show that the generalizedX- Yapproach has significant computational advantages over the usual Riccati equation and, in many cases, the computational gain exceeds rough estimates based solely upon a count of the number of equations to be integrated."
"This short paper presents a technique for generating Lyapunov functions for a broad class of nonlinear systems represented by state equations. The system, for which a Lyapunov function is required, is assumed to have a property called dissipativeness. Roughly speaking, this means that the system absorbs more energy from the external world than it supplies. Different types of dissipativeness can be considered depending on how one chooses to define \"power input.\" Dissipativeness is shown to be characterized by the existence of a computable function which can be interpreted as the \"stored energy\" of the system. Under certain conditions, this energy function is a Lyapunov function which establishes stability, and in some cases asymptotic stability, of the isolated system."
"The subject of this short paper is on-line identification of the parameter vector defining a linear dynamical system which operates in a closed loop in the presence of noise, and incorporates a time delay. The method is based on the equation error. Other known subsystems in the closed-loop system increase the dimension of the closed-loop parameter vector which tends to degrade the estimation convergence process. By means of \"composite state variables,\" introduced in this short paper, this increase is prevented and the open-loop parameters are directly identified from closed-loop input-output data. The pure time delay in the closed loop causes a representation problem in the equation error formulation. This is overcome by \"composite delayed state variables.\" The value of the time delay is determined by means of excess parameters provided by a \"higher order model\" and a simple on-line search procedure. The method is illustrated by simulated examples."
"In this short paper, regions of attraction for multinonlinear systems are obtained using the sector violation information of the nonlinearities when the system is cast in the Lure'-Popov form. An explicit expression for this domain is obtained. The results are applied to a 3-machine power system for estimating the stability region."
"A characterization is given for the class of all closed loop eigenvector sets which can be obtained with a given set of distinct closed loop eigenvalues using state feedback. It is shown, furthermore, that the freedom one has in addition to specifying the closed loop eigenvalues is precisely this: to choose one set of closed loop eigenvectors from this class. Included in the proof of this result is an algorithm for computing the matrix of feedback gains which gives the chosen closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors. A design scheme based on these results is presented which gives the designer considerable freedom to choose the distribution of the modes among the output components. One interesting feature is that the distribution of a mode among the output components can be varied even if the mode is not controllable."
"A procedure is given to determine whether or not a polynomial in several real variables is globally positive. Emphasis is placed on the resolution of singularities of various types that occur during the implementation of the algorithm. A nontrivial example encountered in application of Lyapunov direct method to stability investigation of nonlinear control systems is given to illustrate the details of the procedure."
"A dither is a high-frequency signal introduced into a nonlinear system with the object of augmenting stability. In this paper,[1] it is shown that the effects of dither depend on its amplitude distribution function. The stability of a dithered system is related to that of an equivalent smoothed system, whose nonlinear element is the convolution of the dither distribution and the original nonlinearity. The ability of dithers to stabilize large classes of nonlinear systems is explained in terms of an effective narrowing of the nonlinear sector. A feature of the approach taken here is that a deterministic (i.e., strong) concept of stability is established under probabilistic (i.e., weak) assumptions on the dither."

The disturbance-suppression controller is found to be effective under fairly adverse conditions and in the presence of wide deviations from the nominal disturbance."
"A technique is presented for the analysis of a class of discrete, adaptive model-reference control systems via a linearized error characteristic equation. The approach is used to determine a relationship between system design parameters and the adaptive error convergence rate. A simulation example is used to illustrate the design approach."
"Since cascade compensation of feedback control systems has been first presented, the determination of the lead or lag-lead network has been taught as a trial and error procedure. This correspondence presents a method, based upon the solution of a quadratic equation or a set of parametric curves, which will eliminate this trial and error. Examples for each case are given."
"An integral element of a highly reliable, fault-tolerant system is an efficient failure detection and isolation (FDI) technique. This short paper presents an FDI system whose design criterion is the minimization of the mean time to detect system failures subject to constraints on false-and miss-alarm error probabilities. The cost of missed failure is measured by system performance degradation, while the loss of unfailed components due to false alarm is unacceptable for practical levels of redundancy. An on-line recursive FDI technique is developed through an application of sequential analysis and information feedback. The feedback control is derived by utilization of a monotonicity property of the performance. The analytical performance in terms of mean detection and isolation time is presented. This sequential FDI technique is applied to the problem of second sensor failure isolation to provide fall operational-fail safe capability to the space shuttle's redundant inertial reference units."
"A particular family of strong controllability and observability properties is shown to be relevant to problems in linear multivariable control. Explicit interrelations are established between these system properties and several approaches to multivariable control: in particular, the abstract vector-space approach of Wonham and Morse, and the explicit algorithm approach of Silverman. The results are valid for systems over an arbitrary field."
"The problem of a stochastic linear differential game with any square integrable Martingale as the noise is solved. The solution is obtained by converting the problem to an optimization problem in a Hilbert space."
"In this short paper the problem of finding a minimal left inverse of a linear time-invariant system for nonzero initial conditions is considered. It is shown that this problem is equivalent to finding a minimal dynamical cover. As a result of this, the minimal inverse problem can be solved immediately using the previous results on dynamic covers. No restriction other than invertibility is assumed on the original system."
"An approximate linear model is developed for a linear process in which the control signal can assume only two values,U_{\\max}andU_{\\min}, and which is controlled by varying the fraction δnof a sampling cycle of durationTthat the control is atU_{\\max}. The dynamic equations are of the formw_{n+1} = \\Phi(T)w_{n} + \\bar{\\Gamma}(T)r_{n}where wnis related to the average state xnover one cycle, andr_{n} = \\delta_{n} - \\delta_{s}where δsis the steady-state value of δnrequired to maintain a desired average state xd. The system errore(nT)at sampling intervals is related to these variables by an equation of the forme(nT) = M_{1}w_{n} + M_{2}\\delta_{s} + M_{3}b, wherebis a bias vector. These relations may be used to design a linear control system by well-known techniques for discrete-time systems. The method is illustrated by the design of a third-order process which could represent a temperature control problem. Simulation results are given for a design that includes a Kalman filter for estimating the inaccessible states."
"A class of feedback free processes [1]-[3] is introduced called the class of strong feedback free processes. Equivalent formulations of the strong feedback free (SFF) property are given and compared with equivalent formulations of the earlier definition [1]-[3] of feedback free processes. These latter processes are now termed weak feedback free (WFF) processes. Applications to a simulation experiment and an econometric example are briefly discussed."
"A new realization method for synthesis of the optimal cyclic loss nonlinear filter using a third generation digital computer is proposed. This method consists of carrying a finite set of Fourier coefficients of the conditional density of signal given the observations, and updating these coefficients to determine the Fourier coefficients of the a posteriori density when new observations are obtained. The filtering problem considered is that of phase demodulation. Monte Carlo evaluation of performance of this Fourier filter is given and compared with previous methods. Further, the accuracy and estimate computation time of this method are determined and compared with other methods."
"This short paper considers the problem of designing a compensating control scheme for an observable linear multivariable plant using partial state feedback so that the impulse response matrix of the resulting system exactly corresponds to the impulse response matrix of a prespecified linear model. A procedure is given for the synthesis of the compensator that does not require a separate realization for the plant observer. A sufficient condition is given for the internal stability of the model following system."
"It is shown that the observability of a linear state equation, only input-output accessible, does not imply that all the states can be actually evaluated. Such possibility, depends on the identifiability properties of the equations. A necessary, and sufficient condition for observability of the states, when the equations are unidentifiable, is derived. It is also shown that in such situations the \"actual\" observability' may depend also on the input matrix."
"Problems associated with the optimal linear regulator when one control is penalized much less than the others, and the optimal linear estimator when one measurement is of a much higher quality than the others are considered. Both situations cause the Riccati equation's solution to have transients with radically different speeds. In order to generate solutions with radically different transient speeds, a large number of small numerical integration time steps must be used-small to capture the rapid transient and a large number to generate the slow transient. Approximations are derived to the solutions to these Riccati equations. Although the number of scalar numerical integrations required is reduced by only one, a closed-form approximation is derived for the rapidly varying part of the transient. This allows the use of large numerical integration time steps and results in a considerable decrease in computation time. Measures are derived of both the errors in the approximations and how they affect the resulting regulators and estimators. A numerical example is given comparing the solution of the Riccati equation to its approximation."
"An extension of the adaptation methods presented previously by Ten Cate are presented. Proof of asymptotic stability of the error is effected using Lyapunov theory. This method completes the triplet of a group of previously published adaptation rules for a variation suggested by Shahein et al. using a plant-model parameter misalignment function."
 "This short paper considers the identification of dynamical systems from input-output data. The problem of parameter identifiability for such systems is approached by considering whether system outputs obtained with different parameter values can be distinguished one from another. The results are stated formally by defining the notion of \"output distinguishability.\" Parameter identifiability is then defined precisely in terms of output distinguishability. Relationships have been developed with the other definitions such as least square identifiability and identifiability from the transfer function. Several results for linear and nonlinear systems are presented with examples."
"The possibility of estimating the parameters of a dynamic system when it is operating in closed loop is examined. Earlier considered ways of designing regulators to achieve desired identifiability properties are unified and generalized. The result of the analysis of this short paper gives a simple criterion, which contains earlier known conditions as simple special cases."
"In this short paper, continuous-time optimal control problems are treated, where the cost functional includes additional discrete state penalty termsK_{j}(x(t_{j}))at specified timest_{j}(j = 1,..., N - 1)in the interior of the time interval[t_{0}, t_{N}]of the problem. Necessary conditions for a control to be optimal are given in the form of a minimum principle. The costate is necessarily discontinuous at the timest_{j}(j = 1,..., N - 1). Consequently, the optimal control is discontinuous at tj, in general. A numerical example is given."
"The problem of the invariance of the input-output behavior of time-invariant linear systems under perturbations in the system matrices and initial conditions is examined. Previous results are unified and expanded upon, and new results for invariance in the presence of perturbations in the output matrix are given. Conditions for input-output invariance are related to the subspace of reachable states and its orthogonal complement, and to the subspace of unobservable states."
"This correspondence presents conditions which permit the comparison of the optimal performance of control systems which have the same criterion but different dynamics. These conditions are applied to linear quadratic problems and to establishing performance bounds for suboptimal systems."
"The purpose of this correspondence is to call attention to other solutions to the problem addressed in the above paper,[1] that of adding or deleting parameters or measurements from a given linear model. The solution algorithms proposed in the article are numerically ill-conditioned and are less efficient, in terms of both computational and storage requirements, than the methods described here. Several numerically stable, compact, flexible, and efficient algorithms for analyzing the parameter estimation problem are described and others are referenced."

The effects of discretization, quantization and noise are studied via simulation of a compound inverted pendulum with realistic actuator models."
"Within the context of the optimal control model of human response, analytic expressions for the gradients of closed-loop performance metrics with respect to human operator attention allocation are derived. These derivatives serve as the basis for a gradient algorithm that determines the optimal attention that a human should allocate among several display indicators in a steady-state manual control task. Application of the human modeling techniques are made to study the hover control task for a CH-46 VTOL flight tested by NASA."
"A stochastic control problem for which the optimal dual control law can be calculated analytically is given. The system is a four state Markov chain with transition probabilities that depend on the control variable. The performance of the optimal dual control law and of some suboptimal control laws are calculated and compared."
"New estimation algorithms have been derived for nonlinear continuous-time systems with multiple delays corrupted by white noise and correlated noise. The derivation assumes linearity in innovations and exploits some recent results of nonlinear continuous-time systems to obtain the filtering and error-covariance equations. The results are recursire and physically realizable under the assumption that the conditional probability density functions of the estimator errors are Gaussian."
"A decision theoretic approach to estimation of unknown random and nonrandom parameters from a linear measurements model is proposed, when the a priori statistics are incomplete and only a small number of data points are available. The unknown statistics are partially characterized by considering two regions in the measurement space, namely, good and bad data regions and constraining the partial probability, the partial covariance, or the combination thereof of the measurements. The random parameter is assumed to be Gaussian variable with known mean and known covariance. Choosing the minimum covariance criterion, the min-max estimator is found to be soft-limiter or tangent type nonlinear function depending upon the a priori statistic available. The estimator for the unknown nonrandom parameter is obtained from the root of some function of the residuals, the function being obtained by minimizing the error covariance. The estimator obtained is similar to a random parameter case."
"An alternative way of using the state variable filters, coupled with the Kalman-Yacubovich lemma or Popov's hyperstability theorem, in the design of model reference adaptive systems is proposed. The improvement over previous designs is the increased flexibility in the selection of the filter parameters to reduce the effects of noise or initial conditions."

"Since the first low-loss fibers were reported in 1970, optical transmission research has focused almost entirely on the use of fibers. Earlier work on transmission via periodically focused beams had spawned the need for integrated optics -- using single-mode optical circuitry in miniature dielectric waveguides -- in order to make feasible multiple carrier transmission medium. In both of these two fields -- lightwave transmission on fibers and integrated optics -- there has been exceptional technological progress."

"A 16 GHz microstrip modulator, fabricated on a thin slab of GaAs 25 microns thick, has been developed for CO/sub 2/ laser radiation. An instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz and a single optical sideband efficiency of 0.7 percent has been obtained with 20 watts of microwave driving power."
"Real-time processing of rf signals using guided-wave acoustooptic Bragg-diffraction in LiNbO/sub 3/ waveguides has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. Good performance figures for convolution have been achieved by employing multiple tilted surface acoustic waves: time-bandwidth product of 305, dynamic range of approximately 50 db, total rf power of 310 mW for maximum convolution output and the frequency resolution of 1 MHz (defined at zero convolution output)."
"A popular configuration for electrooptical modulators used in integrated optics consists of periodic electrodes placed on the surface of a thin film waveguide made of electrooptical material. When voltages are applied to the electrodes, the thin film guide becomes spatially modulated with periodicity equal to that of the electrodes. Guided light is diffracted after passing through the modulated region. Experiments have been performed with light normally incident upon the periodic medium as well as incident at the Bragg angle. The measured results were interpreted with well-known theories applicable either in the Raman-Nath regime or in the Phariseau limit. In cases when both limits can not be applied, Klein and Cook devised a numerical solution in which they approximated differential equations by difference equations. The check of the experimental results with these theories has not been satisfactory, especially when the modulation voltage is large."
"The application of network methods to the analysis and design of integrated-optics components is illustrated for the case of dielectric gratings, which are relevant to optical beam couplers, filters and distributed-feed-back lasers. The advantage of the network representation in those cases is that the role of each grating parameter can be interpreted in terms of the network elements. In addition to yielding physical insight into the electromagnetic field behavior, the network approach greatly facilitates the design and construction of dielectric gratings having efficient operation or other desired characteristics."

This paramp is designed for 75/spl deg/K noise temperature capability over the 14.7 - 15.2 GHz frequency range without the use of cryogenic cooling. This extremely low noise performance is made possible by the use therein of ultra high quality, low parasitic content chip varactors, of exceptionally high idler (~80 GHz) and pump (~95 GHz) frequencies and of minimum loss, high isolation signal coupling circulators operated in the \"single pass\" configuration."

"Two different types of FET mixer circuits have been developed for 6/4 GHz frequency translation for communications sateIIite transponder. Gate mixer uses non-linear I/sub d/ - V/sub g/ characteristic, with LO being injected into the gate circuit, while in the drain mixer the LO is injected into the drain circuit and non-linear I/sub d/ - V/sub d/ characteristic is utilized. Both circuits yielded conversion gains up to 3 dB over 500 MHz bandwidth. However, the noise figure of the drain mixer as low as 4 dB was measured compared with 5.7 dB for the gate mixer."

The best result obtained at 4 GHz was a noise figure of 2.3 dB with an associated gain of 9.5 dB. A T-equivalent circuit based on a regional analysis and empirical time constants is shown to accurately predict transistor S-parameters in the 1 to 8 GHz frequency range. Good agreement between predicted/sup 3/ and experimental amplifier noise figure is obtained between 0.4 and 6 GHz."

"This paper considers the problem of optimizing the match between a generator and a resistive load by means of a transformer consisting of equal length line sections alternating with the same length, shunted, shorted stubs. It is argued that, in the optimum transformer, only that stub appears which is in shunt with the low impedance termination. General design formulas are given for a two section transformer with equi-ripple performance over the design band. For an octave band and a two to one transformation, it is shown that this stepped, shunted transformer has substantially superior performance to that of a conventional stepped transformer of the same length. Detailed computations are made in this case which indicate the extent to which this equi-ripple design is optimum."

After addition of internal phase compensation, the phase response of the device over all 16 subpulses is within/spl plusmn/20/spl deg/ of ideal.

"Many new signal processing functions can be achieved through the availability of real-time transforms. One implementation of such transforms uses surface acoustic wave (SAW) linear FM filters. Not only may these SAW devices be employed to produce a real-time signal that is proportional to the Fourier transform of the input, but several of these \"chirp transforms\" can also be configured to provide continuously tunable bandpass/bandstop filtering and versatile programmable matched filtering. Moreover, transform processing permits prewhitening to suppress narrowband interference in some systems.

"The acoustic microscope - an instrument based on acoustic radiation at microwave frequencies - is designed for viewing the microscopic detail exhibited in the elastic properties of a given object. The most significant and the most recent improvement has been the introduction of mechanical scanning. With this innovation there has been substantial improvement in the resolving power since the new instrument has made it possible to work in liquid water with sound frequencies above 1000 MHz. The resolution in a carefully constructed instrument at these frequencies approaches that of the optical instrument and it permits one to observe both the internal details of biological cells and the fine structure of integrated circuits. Even though the resolving power is not yet equal to the value that is achieved with optical waves it does bring into view an interesting part of the microscopic world."

"Over the past several years, there have been significant improvements in solid-state devices (that is, avalanche diodes, Gunn diodes, varactors, mixer diodes, and so on) that have enhanced the overall capability of millimeter-wave receivers. With these improved devices, it is now possible to configure completely solid-state low-noise millimeter-wave receivers. Just as in the microwave range, low -noise parametric amplifiers, broadband low-conversion-loss mixers, and solid-state local oscillators are now available. Furthermore, cryogenically cooled parametric amplifiers and mixers are now possible, resulting in the ultimate in system sensitivity. With the flexibility offered by these all solid-state millimeter-wave components, it is now possible to design the optimum system configuration for the intended application whether it be an advanced communication system, a sophisticated EW application, or satisfying any of the numerous receiver requirements that are being evolved. This paper will briefly describe the performance of present millimeter-wave receiver components and will provide a projection of their performance anticipated in the near future."
 "Microwaves does interact with a variety of materials and systems including Biological. The question arises as to the mode of interaction and whether it constitutes a hazard. The IEEE and the Department of the Navy are co-sponsors of an American National Standards Institute Committee-C-95 on RF Radiation Hazards. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is the national clearinghouse and coordinating body for voluntary standards in the United States. C-95 is an ANSI committee composed of representatives of scientific and technical organizations, industry and trade groups, government agencies and public interest groups, and their task is to develop standards relating to the committees field of interest. The actual work of the committee is accomplished by sub-committees, membership in which is a function of expertise and the ability to contribute to the work of the committee. In addition to its co-sponsorship of C-95 the IEEE has five (5) representatives, voting as a group, one of which represents MTT-S. This session is essentially a report to MTT-S on the technical activities of C-95 as well as a review and state of the art in the area of Biological Effects and Hazards of Microwave Radiation. It will also provide an opportunity for interaction between members of C-95 and the microwave community."

"Techniques are presented for the synthesis of interdigital acoustic surface-wave filter tap weights so as to give transfer functions having a Chebyshev stopband attenuation characteristic with a specified minimum attenuation, along with a single-peaked or a Chebyshev double-peaked passband characteristic. The techniques first give the gain zero locations, and as a result are very flexible. Linear phase or minimum or maximum phase-shift characteristics are obtainable. The transfer function can be factored into two sets of zeros which can be realized as two separate anodized transducers which, when operated with a multistrip coupler, will give the desired overall transfer function. Also, it is shown that the class of designs having a double-peaked passband can be realized in the form of an unanodized phase-reversal transducer (PRT) in cascade with a second transducer having very smooth anodization and no phase reversals. The fact that such designs have such smooth anodization with relatively few small taps can help in obtaining precision performance."
"Four-port microwave-integrated-circuit (MIC) edge-guided wave circulators (BGC) have been designed, fabricated, and tested. A mathematical characterization of the strip conductor's shape as well as a precise mechanical control of the bias inhomogeneity are provided. By means of these two techniques the reproducibility of the device is greatly improved with respect to that of the EGC obtained by the traditional cut-and-try methods. X-band performance data are presented and related to the spatial distribution of the effective magnetic permeability mu/sub eff/ in the ferrite substrate. Experimental evidence is reported that an efficient circulator action occurs when mu/sub eff/< 0 at some point under the central circular shield. The spatial distribution of the RF electric field at the circulator's surface is investigated by a mechanical probing technique. It is found that in the lower part of the operation band, RF fields of considerable amplitude extend in the air in the region between the guiding edge and the substrate's edge."
"Microwave irradiation at 960-MHz CW of isolated poikilothermic hearts in Ringer's solution causes bradycardia. Tachycardia is usually produced by generalized heating, suggesting the possibility of a different mechanism in this case. The effect occurs only over a narrow power range of approximately 2-10 mW/g absorbed by the heart. It is hypothesized that microwave radiation causes neurotransmitter release either by excitation of the nerve remnants in the heart, or by some other mechanism, producing bradycardia over a restricted range of power absorption. Drugs which can change the response of the heart to transmitter substances have been used, and the results support a neurotransmitter release hypothesis. A generalized heating effect, causing tachycardia, is predominant at higher levels of absorbed power."
"A millimeter-wave circular TE/sub 01/ mode waveguide generates undesired circularly symmetric modes (TE/sub 02/, TE/sub 03/ modes, etc.) in bends or at discontinuities along a waveguide line. This paper describes the theory and experiment on the TE/sub 02/ and TE/sub 03/ mode filters developed for guided millimeter-wave transmission. The experimental results of two improved TE/sub 03/ mode filters show that the attenuation of the TE/sub 03/ mode is more than 16 dB for one type over the 40-70-GHz range. The TE/sub 01/-mode insertion loss of another type is about 0.2 dB over the 40-80-GHz range. The present mode filters can be applied to various high-speed guided rnillimeter-wave systems currently under development."
"An experimental investigation into the effects of package and circuit reactances on wide-band varactor-tuned oscillators is described. The results are used to design an X-band Gunn coaxial oscillator with a tuning range in excess of 3 GHz. It is shown that the stray reactance, junction capacitance, and bond-wire inductance affect the varactor tuning characteristics. The characteristics are conveniently displayed by the reflection phase variation with tuning voltage and frequency. A general theory for wide-band varactor-tuned oscillators is presented which is related to the impedance characteristics. These results are used to design three coaxial varactor-tuned oscillators. The first two oscillators are series arrangements while the third oscillator is a parallel arrangement. A simple circuit technique is used to improve the tuning range of each arrangement. This technique is shown to increase the coupling to the varactor diode and decrease the oscillator Q by reactance compensation."
"Rectangular waveguides partially filled with a dielectric slab in the E plane can provide an alternative to ridged waveguides in broad-band systems. It is shown that by an appropriate choice of the dielectric constant, maximum power handling capacity for a given bandwidth and cutoff wavelength can be achieved. This power-handling capacity is much higher than for ridged waveguides. Attenuation and the effect of the first longitudinal-section-electric (LSE) mode on bandwidth are also discussed."
"Measuring temperature in material being heated by radio-frequency (RF) fields is difficult because of field perturbations and direct heating caused by any conventional leads connected to the temperature sensor. A temperature probe consisting simply of a thermistor and plastic high-resistance leads appears to practically eliminate these problems. The design goals are described, and the performance of an initial test model of this type of probe is discussed."
"A short computer program is developed to solve explicitly a very useful reflectometer error model currently receiving high utilization in microwave measurement systems.

"A method of obtaining an improved transition, from 0.141-in (3.55-mm) semirigid coaxial to microstrip is described. Further improvements by means of compensation include two fixed types having a reflection coefficient less than 0.005 and an adjustable form capable of producing a \"transparent\" transition."
"Suggestions are given for improving the vibrating dipole technique for measuring the phase and amplitude of millimeterwave electric fields in free space. It is shown that the system can be simplified, at the same time reducing certain measurement errors and increasing the system's sensitivity and dynamic range. It is found that significant errors can result if the field being measured varies appreciably in amplitude, and/or if the phase does not vary linearly with position over the dipole's excursions."
"Time-domain metrology (TDM) techniques are applied to determine loss and dispersion in microstrip and coaxial cable for possible future use in interconnections in the frequency range of 0.4-10 GHz. After a brief presentation of the method, results are given for microstrip, RG/U 58, and RG/U 188A coaxial cable. Good agreement is obtained between measured, computed, and published values. Major advantages of the technique are that unwanted multiple reflections can be excluded from the measurement time window, and errors from interface discontinuities can be evaluated and removed from the final result."

The absolute bandwidth over which the input signal will be divided by a particular integer K and the maximum output frequency is the device transit time frequency. The percentage bandwidth is 200/(2K - 1) percent. With two-terminal TED's, divide-by-K (K = 2, 3, 4, 5) was demonstrated with substantial bandwidth."

The reflection coefficients of these optimum networks are equiripple and have the maximum number of zeros in the design band consistent with their length."

"Results of a study of nonlinearities and intermodulation characteristics of 3-port distributed circulators are presented. Based on a rigorous theoretical analysis of the third-order nonlinearity in ferrites, analytical results are derived for the field strength and the power level of the intermodulation signal. These explicit results are applicable to high-power distributed circulators operating in VHF, UHF, and microwave frequencies. Measured intermodulation characteristics of an experimental distributed VHF high-power circulator are also presented."
"Propagation behavior of light beams along the tapered lenslike media, in which both the focusing parameter and the on-axis permittivity have gradients in the axial direction, is investigated in detail, theoretically and numerically, with the help of the approximate wave theory. As a result, it is clarified that the tapered lenslike media can be classified into two kinds, according to the differences of the focusing property. Matched incidence conditions to eliminate the fluctuations of the light beam are also clarified. As an application of the theory, a spot-size transducer and a mode transducer for use in a circular bend of the light focusing waveguide are proposed, and the design conditions are derived. A ray-oscillation suppressor (ROS) is also proposed, and its applicability to some new optical circuit components is discussed."
"The capacitance matrix of a straight pair of uniform wires symmetrically placed in a shield is determined theoretically. Exact expressions for the elements of the capacitance matrix are determined as particular elements of the inverse of an infinite matrix which relates the Fourier coefficients of the surface-charge densities on the inner conductors and the shield to the applied voltage excitations on the cable conductors. If the wire diameter is small relative to the wire separation, and if the wire separation is small relative to the shield diameter, then accurate numerical approximations for the elements of the capacitance matrix are obtained to any degree of accuracy by suitably truncating the infinite matrix. Once the elements of the capacitance matrix are determined, then the distributions of the surface-charge densities on the peripheries of the inner conductors, and the shield are determined for any arbitrary excitation of the cable structure. In particular, the various capacitances associated with the cable structure, e.g., the direct, ground, and mutual capacitances, are determined from a comparison of the surface-charge densities resulting from a \"balanced\" excitation and a \"longitudinal\" excitation. The Fourier coefficients of the surface-charge densities are required to determine the propagation parameters and the associated propagation modes of the cable structure. The surface-charge distributions are evaluated numerically for a typical standard production cable using 22-gauge wires. The results of this paper will be extended by a perturbational method to include twisted wires in a shield; also, certain types of asymmetries in the cable geometry will be considered. Hence, the propagation constants and the associated propagation modes of unbalanced and/or twisted shielded pair cables can also be determined."
"A general expression is found for the susceptance of two narrow transverse strips of differing width, unsymmetrically located in a rectangular waveguide. This analysis is based on extremization of the current-density ratio between the two strips, through use of the variational principle. The resulting susceptance values have been experimentally verified, and the theory is valid for interstrip spacings ranging down to the point where the two strips touch, or even overlap."

"The resonant frequency of a TE/sub 01delta//spl deg/ dielectric resonator was obtained by assuming a cylindrical surface containing the circumference of a dielectric resonator as a magnetic wall. In such a method, the error was less than 10 percent. In this short paper, the resonant frequency is obtained by a variational method, where the surface impedance is variated from a infinite value. The theoretical value of a resonant frequency has a good agreement with our experimental result with an error less than 1 percent."

However, the previous literature does not include the case when the side of the outer and inner rectangle are in the ratio 2:1 both in width and in height: if in [1, eq. (11)] we put OA = DE or EO = AB, modulus k coincides with modulus h and the rectangular line becomes a square coaxial section, which is a special case of Bowman."

"A new wide-band microwave balun particularly attractive for microstrip circuitry is described in which the normally balanced line is in the form of a pair of equal-amplitude and antiphase unbalanced lines. This novel method of input-output coupling allows a coplanar arrangement of input and output microstrip lines. Often the balanced and unbalanced line impedances in a balun are unequal, necessitating an impedance-matching network. A first-order reflection coefficient theory that mutually considers the impedance effects of the balun cavity, a compensating stub, and a quarter-wave transformer is used to design wide-band impedance-matched baluns. Curves of VSWR versus bandwidth are presented for several balanced-to-unbalanced line-impedance ratios. Experimental results are given for an octave-band impedance-matched balun with a balanced-to-unbalanced impedance ratio of 2:1. The new wide-band balun is adaptable to a microstrip magic tee. A proposed magic tee that relies on circuit symmetry for operation has multioctave bandwidth potential."

"A new waveguide-microstrip transition is described. This design provides wide-band performance (18-26 GHz) and very good reproducibility without the need for variable elements. The circuit is fully integrated on the substrate and the characteristics are much less sensitive to small variations in the dimensions than other known transitions. A narrow-band version has been made for the telecommunication band in particular (17.7-19.7 GHz) with a VSWR less than 1.1 and an attenuation less than 0.25 dB. The design can easily be scaled to other frequencies and is especially useful at frequencies above 10 GHz."
"Experiments on dc-bias-current-tuned IMPATT diodes mounted in low-impedance waveguide mounts are described. Broad-band bias-current-tuned IMPATT oscillators were obtained which cover almost the full waveguide band; 20-, 24-, and 18-GHz tuning bandwidths were obtained with the R-500, R-620, and R-740 waveguide, respectively. From experiments it became evident that there are some suitable relations for broad-band bias tuning among the diode breakdown voltage, the oscillation frequency, and the waveguide dimension. The results are very useful for the design of the circuit and diode parameter for broad-band millimeterwave IMPATT sweep oscillators. The feasibility of applying bias-current-tuned IMPATT oscillators to a broad-band measuring instrument is expected."
"A stabilized X-band oscillator using a germanium avalanche diode in a microwave integrated circuit (MIC) is proposed. The stabilization is achieved by coupling a transmission cavity to the resonant cavity in which an avalanche diode is embedded. A mode-jumping problem inherent in a coupled-cavity oscillator was solved coupling a third varactor-embedded low-Q cavity to the transmission cavity. As a result, single-mode oscillation in an MIC oscillater was successfully obtained. Varactor tuning can also be realized with as small a change in output power as 7 percent for a tuning range of 30 MHz. The experimental results and the theoretical analysis of the new stabilized oscillator are given."
"Semiconductor noise sources for microwave frequencies have been constructed using commercial avalanche diodes in waveguide mounts. For the diodes and waveguide configurations reported here the upper usable frequency is approximately 40 GHz. The measurements are in limited agreement with previous predictions. It is possible that a reduction in package and diode parasitic would improve this agreement, and raise appreciably the upper usable frequency of such noise sources."

"A study of the internal dynamics and microwave properties of an X-band transferred-electron device having ohmic contacts is reported. Numerieal calculations of the electric field evolution and large-signal properties of the device have been carried out for frequencies throughout the 6-12-GHz range and for a wide range in ac voltage amplitude including amplitudes insufficient for space-charge quenching. An investigation is made of the influence of electron diffusion upon the field evolution and properties of the device. The large-signal admittance plane is determined and used to examine the behavior of the device in microwave circuits. A comparison is made between the calculated device properties and those of experimental devices. Circuit-controlled oscillation is found to be possible throughout the 6-12-GHz range for ac voltage amplitudes well below those required for space-charge quenching. At these amplitudes diffusion is shown to have a strong effect upon the electric field evolution and large-signal properties, and this effect is shown to bear significantly upon the behavior of the device in microwave circuits. Finally, the numerically calculated large-signal properties are found to agree reasonably well with experimental results."
"A new unified theory is presented for the synthesis of exactly equiripple low-pass prototypes having: a) one simple pole of attenuation at a real frequency; or b) a single pair of real-axis transmission zeros (giving linear-phase performance). These types of filters may be regarded as representing the least possible degree of complication over the conventional Chebyshev filter, and are usually realized with one extra cross coupling in the structure. It is demonstrated that this gives much improved skirt selectivity in the case of a finite frequency pole, making it a viable intermediate case between the Chebyshev and elliptic function filters, while in the case of real-frequency zeros, very flat group delay over 50 percent of the passband is achieved with minimal cost in insertion loss and skirt rejection. Approximate and exact synthesis techniques are described, including results for the previously neglected odd-degree case. Experimental results demonstrate agreement with theory."
"The literature concerning the reentrant cylindrical cavity is reviewed and the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various formulations of the problem are discussed. In addition, a new formulation is proposed which accurately predicts the resonant frequency of narrow-gap cavities such as those currently finding application in the construction of solid-state oscillators. This new formulation is mathematically simpler and numerically more efficient than many other formulations which are not as accurate. The paper concludes with an investigation of the toning characteristics of the cavity."
"This paper presents, explicitly, an approach to the exact calculation of group delay and its sensitivities with respect to component parameters based on the adjoint network concept and applicable to linear time-invariant circuits. In general, no more than four analyses are required and the computational effort is only moderately more than is necessary for a single analysis. The results presented are in a form particularly suited to the computer-aided design of microwave circuits and include useful tables of sensitivity expressions."
"The nonuniform discretization of the integral equation on the tangential electromagnetic (EM) field on the boundary surface is proposed as a numerically efficient method to analyze the microstrip-like transmission lines. The calculated results of the propagation constant of the microstrip line based on this method are compared with other published analytical results. Various types of planar striplines are treated by the same formulas. The dominant and higher order modes of shielded microstrip line are discussed and compared with the longitudinal-section electric (LSE) and linear synchronous motor (LSM) modes of a two-medium waveguide."
"An exact solution for the complex propagation constant in semiconductor loaded waveguides is obtained by superimposing a finite number of plane waves. The analysis is carried out through the study of the parallel-plate waveguide. Numerical results have been obtained by means of a numerical program previously set up. Reciprocal and nonreciprocal behavior of the electromagnetic (EM) structure, depending on the semiconductor parameters, geometrical parameters, and applied magnetic field, is illustrated. A good quantitative agreement between the theory and the experiments in [11] is shown."
"The edge condition allows us to know the asymptotic decrease of modal amplitudes in some discontinuity problems in waveguides. One may take a direct account of this information in modal analysis and gain a significant improvement of the calculation when the field singularity at edge is important. The accuracy and the validity of this method are studied in two cases: the diaphragm and the junction between an empty waveguide and a partially dielectric-filled waveguide."
"By employing a simple transformation that preserves numerical accuracy, improved precision is obtainable using a Richards' extraction technique to obtain characteristic impedances of commensurate transmission-line structures. Furthermore, reduced sensitivity to coefficient truncation can result in computational savings."

"A procedure is given to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients of a full-height dielectric slab centered in a rectangular waveguide. The effects of loss and of finite length are included. The magnitude squared of the electric field along the slab is calculated in order to predict inhomogeneous heat input to the sample. These results are compared with experimental measurements on several materials and the pupae of Tenebrio molitor."
"In most experimental investigations of the biological effects of microwave radiation, it is necessary to use low-loss dielectric materials for restraining animals under irradiation. Because of the complexity of the aualysis of the animal-restrainer combination, an analysis is made of the scattering of microwave fields by a simplified model of the restrainer with no animal present. The model chosen is that of a plane wave incident at an arbitrary angle upon a rectangular slab of finite width and thickness. Numerical results indicate that the scattered fields within a square region of one wavelength in distance from the slab surfaces are greatly enhanced and highly nonuniform. In particular, the maxima for parallel incidence exceed those for normal incidence by almost a factor of 2."
"A waveguide containing gyrotropic media is shown to be bidirectional if it possesses at least one of the following symmetry operations: reflection in a plane perpendicular to the waveguide axis; 180/spl deg/ rotation about an axis perpendicular to the waveguide axis; or inversion in a point on the waveguide axis. The relation between the modal electromagnetic field components for any complementary mode pair is given for each symmetry case."
"The piezoelectric and magnetoelastic surface wave propagation through a composite layered structure of one piezoelectric and another magnetoelastic media is considered with a metal plate placed in between them.

"A new Michelson-interferometer (MI) hybrid having a miter angle is developed for use as a millimeter-wave band-splitting filter. The construction and operating principle of the filter are described. The design method and the experimental results are also presented. This filter has low branching loss, yet keeps very wide band characteristics. For the 4W-120-GHz-frequency-range filter with 35/spl deg/ miter angle, the branching loss is 0.68-1.56dB. This is about 40 percent lower than that of the conventional MI filter. The input VSWR is less than 1.29 and the guard bandwidth is less than 250 MHz. This filter can be used for the 40-120-GHz guided-millimeter-wave transmission systems."
"A synthesis procedure for distributed bandstop filters that approximate an elliptic-function response is described. Existing tables of lumped constant elliptic-function filters are used together with an approximate transform that exchanges commensurate Foster sections for noncommensurate pairs of stubs or coupled lines. The method is usable for all bandwidths up to about 100 percent, providing that networks with a relative bandwidth of more than 50 percent are considered to be pseudo-low-pass."
"The design considerations and performance characteristics of two high-power microwave reflection amplifiers that use multiple silicon IMPATT diodes are presented. The amplifiers employ microstrip hybrid-circuit-type power combiners to combine the individually matched IMPATT diodes. The first unit, a single-stage 4-diode amplifier, produced 8-W output with 6-dB gain while the second 12-diode amplifier gave 15.8-W output at about 9-dB gain. FM and AM noise added by these amplifiers has been measured with each amplifier driven to nearly full output. Use of microstrip hybrid-circuit power combiners appears to offer a simple and economical design approach for the implementation of microwave solid-state power amplifiers using multiple active devices."
"The noise power at the IF output of a superheterodyne mixer which is caused by local-oscillator noise can be significantly reduced by using the recently developed subharmonically pumped down-converter. In many cases this reduction is so large that even noisy sources, such as IMPATT oscillators, can be used to pump low-noise mixers without causing significant degradation of noise figure."
"A method of construction of the Gunn oscillator for wideband frequency tuning has been developed using the ridged-waveguide cavity. The ridged waveguide can be designed to provide the dominant mode with a wide bandwidth, and also to provide the higher order cutoff modes whose resonance is a limiting factor of the tuning range for oscillators of conventional design with reduced stored energies to permit wide-band tuning. A prototype oscillator having a packaged X-band diode demonstrated an 8-18-GHz tuning range."
"This short paper describes a practical design and performance of 60-90-GHz broad-band mixers. Conversion loss was less than 11 dB in the 60-90-GHz region, and the conversion-loss deviation could be less than about 1 dB throughout the 30-GHz band with fixed circuit parameters. In this design, a new construction technique, using a wave absorber in place of a filter in the IF circuit, was employed."
"The effect of thin-film Bi/sub 2/O/sub 3/ overlay on a microstrip resonator has been studied. An improvement in Q suggests that Iower radiation loss may be achieved in this manner."
"The measurement of weak coupling between two guided modes, for which the usual TE/sub 10/setups cannot be directly used, is dealt with. This problem mainly arises iu coupling between different waveguides and in overmoded waveguides. In both cases a representation by means of two coupled lines is chosen, described by a directional coupler scattering matrix. In addition to the well-known resonant Klinger method, a new one, in the time domain, is suggested. This new method makes use of a shuttle pulse test set and starts from the observation of the envelope of an output signal, which under suitable conditions shows zeros related to the coupling to be measured. Experimental results, with frequencies up to 90 GHz and conplings as low as -40 dB, confirm the accuracy and the sensitivity of the new method."
"A device which transmits wide-band signals in the VHF range across a rotating structure is described. It has potential application to rotating antenna systems and to telemetry systems between stationary and rotating elements. No electrical contact is necessary between the stationary and rotating terminals, and bandwidths on the order of 1000:1 are feasible. From the theoretical analysis given here, predicted device behavior agrees well with measurements on a prototype model."
"A microstrip or stripline four-port structure which allows two signal paths to physically cross over while maintaining high isolation is described in this letter."
"It is well known that some waveguide circulators exhihit an unwanted spurious mode within their passband, which limits their insertion loss and bandwidth. This mode is identified as the TE/sub 0,1,delta/ one in the case of the waveguide junction which relies on the TM/sub 1,1delta,/ mode for its operation. The influence of the saturation magnetization on the separation between the two modes is studied in detail. A mode suppressor is also described which decouples the coupled TE/sub 0,1,delta/ mode without altering the frequency of the circulation ones. This suppressor consists of a thin metal ring placed on the open face of one of the ferrite disks."

"Microwave performance of single-gate and dual-gate GaAs MESFET's with submicron gate structure is described. Design consideration and device technologies are also discussed. The performance of these GaAs MESFET's exceeds previous performance with regard to lower noise and higher gain up to X band: 2.9-dB noise figure (NF) and 10.0-dB associated gain at 12 GHz for a 0.5-mu m single-gate MESFET, and 3.9-dB NF and 13.2-dB associated gain at the same frequency for a dual-gate MESFET with two 1-mu m gates."

These devices have produced 3-W output power at 1.5 GHz as a Class B amplifier and exhibit excellent linearity and noise properties. Device modeling has shown that parasitic capacitances are the chief factor limiting the frequency response, and the prospects for useful devices at 4 GHz are good."

A selective GaAs epitaxial process is introduced to form \"inlaid\" n+ source and drain regions that can provide a high drain-source breakdown voltage and a low ohmic-contact resistance. Typical characteristics of the MESFET composed of two-cell units are as follows:"
"The results of a short study into the reliability and failure modes of GaAs MESFET's are presented. Two failure modes have been observed during this study and improved fabrication techniques that reduce their occurrence have been examined. The results obtained indicate that extremely reliable devices can be manufactured with a predicted mean time to failure in excess of 10/sup 7/ h at junction temperatures of 70/spl deg/C. Room-temperature life tests in excess of 1/2 million device hours lend support to these predictions."
"Failure modes have been studied phenomenologically on a small-signal GaAs MESFET with a 1mu m aluminum gate. Three major failure modes have been revealed, i.e., gradual degradation due to source and drain contact degradation, catastrophic damage due to surge pulse, and instability or reversible drift of electrical characteristics during operation. To confirm the product quality and to assure the device reliability, a quality assurance program has been designed and incorporated in a production line. A cost-effective lifetime prediction method is presented that utilizes correlations between RF parameters and dc parameters calculated using an equivalent circuit model. Mean time to failure (MTTF) value of over 10/sup 8/ h has been obtained for the GaAs MESFET for an operating channel temperature of 100/spl deg/C."
"This paper describes several techniques used to design and realize small-signal amplifiers at X band using Plessey 1-mu m gate-length GaAs MESFET's. Noise figures of 3 dB or better at 8 GHz with associated gains of 5.5 dB have been produced. The mounting of GaAs MESFET's on 25-mil-thick alumina substrates and their S-parameter characterization is described. Owing to some uncertainties in these measurements, four parallel approaches were used to realize amplifiers. The \"designed,\" \"semidesigned,\" \"semituned,\" and \"tuned\" methods are described and results are presented for each case. A semidesigned single-stage amplifier has a gain of 8 /spl plusmn/ 0.6 dB from 8.5 to 9.5 GHz and a minimum noise figure of 4.4 dB.

Three combination techniques, direct paralleling, resistive combiners, and hybrid quadrature couplers are discussed. Finally, considerations for absolute stability are presented."
"The performance, with emphasis on wide bandwidth, that can be expected of linear medium power GaAs microwave MESFET (metal semiconductor field-effect-transistor) amplifiers is discussed. It starts with measured scattering parameters of devices and proceeds through computer-optimized device modeling, to amplifier circuit designs and performance results. It shows computed and measured octave bandwidth performance and reveals that decade bandwidth is feasible. It discusses single-ended and balanced amplifier design approaches. Some practical designs with performance results are presented, with circuit topologies which are easily realizable in microstrip."
"A theoretical analysis and experimental verification of the signal properties of the GaAs MESFET mixer are presented. Experimental techniques for evaluating some of the mixer parameters are described. Experiments performed on GaAs MESFET mixers at X band show that good noise performance and large dynamic range can be achieved with conversion gain. A conversion gain over 6 dB is measured at 7.8 GHz. Noise figures as low as 7.4 dB and output third-order intermodulation intercepts of +18 dBm have heen obtained at 8 GHz with a balanced MESFET mixer."
"GaAs metal-semiconductor FET's (MESFET) are developed for use in amplifiers at microwave frequencies. The FET has a Schottky barrier between the gate and source, operating in the same manner as a Schottky-barrier diode. If the Schottky barrier is used as a mixer, the IF signal is generated and simultaneously amplified by the FET itself. Thus a mixer with IF preamplifier can be realized. In this paper the theoretical and experimental results of a FET mixer are described. In such operations, the conversion loss in the freqnency conversion alone is large due to the high series resistance of the Schottky barrier. However, the overall FET mixer has a \"conversion gain\" because the IF gain of the FET is made large. The experimental conversion gain is 6 dB at the RF frequency of 10.8 GHz and the IF frequency of 1.7 GHz. The noise figure of the FET mixer is at present large (15 dB, for example), due to large conversion loss in the frequency conversion."
"This paper describes a GaAs metal-semiconductor FET (GaAs MESFET) phase regenerator for biphase phase-shift keying (PSK) signals at the carrier frequency. By using this regenerator, decision and reshaping of the signals can be made without detection, thus repeaters can be simplified. This paper shows that phase regeneration is characterized by the symbol m, which denotes the ratio of the normal signal to the phase-inverted signal. Ideal phase regeneration is obtained for m = 1. An analysis of the ratio m for the MESFET regenerator is presented, and it is shown that, if the gate bias or the local-oscillator power level are selected at a slightly higher point than that minimizing the conversion loss, then m = 1.03 is obtained at an excess loss of 3 dB. To verify this analysis, the ratio m was measured experimentally and it was found to agree with the analysis. Static and dynamic characteristics were also measured, and it is shown that the MESFET regenerator has decision and reshaping ability."
"This short paper presents a self-aligned technique which permits the production of submicrometer gate lengths and spacings between contacts. The exclusive use of standard photolithographic techniques makes this method interesting. Microwave measurements are reported for such a device with a 0.7-mu m gate length in a 2.2-mu m drain-source spacing. The yield of the process is usually better than 80 percent."
"The noise- and s-parameters of a GaAs MESFET with 1-mu m gate Iength are characterized versus temperature. At room temperature, the noise figure measured at 12 GHz is 3.5 dB. At 90 K, the noise figure decreases to 0.8 dB (T/sub e/ = 60 K). The associated gain is 8 dB. The design of a cooled amplifier for the 11.7-12.2-GHz communication band is discussed. At 60 K, the three-stage amplifier exhibits 1.6-dB noise figure (T/sub e/ = 130 K) and 31-dB gain."

Sharpening factors, t/sub r in/ / t/sub r out/,of 3 and voltage amplification factors of 2 at 50 Omega have been achieved for output pulses up to 100 mA. The sharpening effect is caused mainly by the voltage-dependent gate capacitance which varies with the input pulse amplitude."

"An analog phase-locked oscillator is used as a power amplifier for FM communications signals. Intended service is for FDM telephone message service or television relay. The output power is generated in a varactor-tuned oscillator, which is synchronized with a weak input signal using a phase-lock loop. This involves a phase detector and a wide-band direct-coupled video amplifier whose output is applied to the tuning varactor. The paper is largely theoretical, relating the parameters of the feedback loop to the performance of the overall device. Explicit expressions are derived for the noise figure, the frequency response of the modulation characteristic, AM-PM conversion, and nonlinearity effects in terms of differential gain and intermodulation. In addition, two experimental models are described, together with certain measured data. The phase-lock method differs in many ways from multistage reflection amplifiers and appears to offer advantages for many applications. The device has adequate bandwidth and linearity for a single FDM-FM signal with 1800 or more channels, but must be tuned to the intended frequeucy. Tuning procedures are simple. High gain of 25-35 dB is obtainable in a single microwave \"stage.\" Most of this gain may be associated with the functions of phase detection, video amplification, and VCO tuning. Of major importance, with respect to noise, is that the device is functionally equivalent to a high-gain low-noise microwave preamplifier followed by a low-gain power amplifier stage in which the preamplifier has the noise figure of the phase detector combined with the video amplifier, and the power stage has a noise figure appropriate to the class of power diode used. FM noise generation is substantially lower than in a high-gain reflection amplifier using the same class of microwave power diode throughout."
"An approximate theory on the propagation of modes in an arbitrarily inhomogeneous optical waveguide embedded in a homogeneous medium is presented. Simple formulas are given, whereby the propagation constants can be determined assuming that the analytic solution is known in the absence of cladding. The results obtained applying the theory to a truncated parabolic-index profile are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained by the rigorous analysis. The theory is also applied to the propagation of TE and TM waves in truncated near-parabolic-index media."
"An equivalent model is presented for evaluating the fringing-field effects in edge-guided waves (EGW) propagating along ferrite microstrip circuits. It is based on the approximate model developed by Getsinger for nonferromagnetic microstrip circuits. Fringing-field effects are characterized by a fringing-field parameter b/b' whose numerical value is determined by experiment. Measurements are made on EGW resonators of various shapes for different values of the applied magnetic bias. Finally, the fringing-field parameter is used to evaluate the ratio between the reactive power stored in the fringing fields and the RF power in the ferrite under the strip conductor in a disk resonator."
"This paper describes first that a simple closed-form characteristic equation can be derived from the variational formulation of the wave propagation in an optical fiber, provided that 1) the permittivity in the core is proportional to r/sup alpha/, where r is the radial coordinate and 1 < alpha < /spl infin/, and 2) the cladding is uniform. The obtained equation is then solved for various permittivity (or refractive-index) profiles. The results obtained are useful both for the understanding of the dispersion characteristics and for the design of inhomogeneous optical fibers. The optimum profile for a multimode fiber is derived and discussed"
"A new mathematical model is developed which extends Volterra series analysis of nonlinear systems with memory to high-frequency systems, including those containing linear distributed component devices. A generalized set of nonlinear scattering parameters is defined which can be used to describe power transfer and distortion in nonlinear multiports, and which reduce to the classical scattering parameters for linear networks. The methodology is based on Volterra functional series, and is most useful for the small-signal case where the response can be approximated by a finite number of terms of the series. Nonlinear scattering kernels, derived by extending the Volterra analysis, are simply related to previously developed nonlinear voltage and current Volterra kernels. For sinusoidal inputs nonlinear scattering parameters are defined which are shown to be particularly helpful when power relationships are studied. The principal applications are for microwave networks terminated in real-valued site reference impedances. To evaluate the average power dissipated in a load at some intermodulation frequency, the concept of nonlinear transducer gain is defined and shown to be proportional to the squared magnitude of a nonlinear scattering parameter. Examples are presented illustrating the analysis procedure for a tunnel diode reflection amplifier and for a linear lossless transmission line terminated by a non-linear network."
"The total electric field inside some simulated biological bodies induced by an electromagnetic wave has been quantified by the recently developed tensor integral equation method and measured by an insulated probe. In general, the induced electric field inside a biological body was found to be quite complicated. An excellent agreement was obtained between theory and experiment."
"Propagation behavior of light beams along sinusoidal and serpentine bends as well as circular bends and linearly tapered bends of optical waveguides consisting of a square-law Ienslike medium is investigated in detail, both theoretically and numerically, on the basis of the approximate wave theory. A new design method of the circular bend for removing the effects of the bend is proposed and numerical results are presented. The divergence phenomena of the beam trajectory in both the sinusoidal and serpentine bends of the optical waveguide are discussed in comparison with mode-conversion phenomena occurring in the circular TE/sub 01/ waveguide with the same bends. Several design conditions to eliminate undulations of the beam trajectory and/or the spot size which would occur at a circnlar bend of the optical waveguide are also studied, and interesting analogies to the design conditions proposed so far to prevent mode-conversion losses at a circular bend of the TE/sub 01/ waveguide are shown."
"A method used to treat static problems in microstrip is extended to treat time-harmonic problems of covered and uncovered microstrip. Both longitudinal and transverse currents are taken into account, Impedance functions (integrals of Green's functions) for covered and uncovered microstrip are derived in terms of improper integrals (limits 0 --->/spl infin/). Accurate evaluation of these integrals is carried out. Matrix methods are then used to obtain propagation constants for the fundamental and higher order modes. Data obtained agree closely with experiment."
"The general AM and FM noise spectrum analysis of Sweet for transferred-electron devices is extended to include the variation of device admittance with both bias- and RF-voltage amplitudes. This is important because recent investigations by the author suggest that there are significant variations of device admittance with both parameters. Also the expressions for the AM and FM noise spectra are formulated in terms of the more basic quantities such as stored charge, modulation sensitivities, and incremental admittance."
"Several integral relationships are presented for commensurate transmission-line networks. The integrals focus on the fact that Z(1) for such networks, where Z(S) is the input immittance of the network, is associated with a real or redundant unit element prefacing the network.

"Microwave propagation through a rectangular waveguide completely filled with semiconductor and subject to a transverse magnetic field is analyzed. When the magnetic field is parallel-to the broad wall of the waveguide (the x axis), propagation is analyzed in terms of the Hall effect. For the magnetic field parallel to the y axis, the effect of the field on the propagation is shown to be due to longitudinal magneto-resistance effects. Good agreement is obtained between theory and experiment in both cases. The experiments were performed at 30 GHz using n-type germanium."
"A previous development is extended to permit attenuation calculations when a braided cable is located close to a tunnel wall. This is an important case in mine communications utilizing leaky feeders. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effects of numerous parameters on mode attenuation. A principal finding is that the attenuation rate for the bifilar mode is hardly affected at all by the finite conductivity of the wall. On the other hand, the monofilar mode suffers a very high attenuation when the cable approaches the wall."
"The IEC has suggested that maximum allowable displacements of waveguide flanges should not cause the inherent return loss due to waveguide tolerances to degrade more than 1 dB. Calculations on displaced unequal waveguides at their extreme tolerances show that this leads to a maximum allowable displacement of 0.0175 of the broad (= a) dimension for a waveguide tolerance of /spl plusmn/ a/500. The worst return loss under these conditions is approximately -41dB. However, it is suggested that this maximum allowable displacement is based on a statistically remote worse case condition, and relaxation to a value of 0.021a would be more realistic."

Measurement is made at the actual microwave frequency at which the ceramic will be used. Results are repeatable to within /spl plusmn/ 0.1 percent of the dielectric constant relative to a known standard substrate. A measurement rate of 100/h can easily be achieved. A circuit is described which is used at 1.4 GHz and measures an area of approximately 1/2-in diameter on 25-mil-thick alumina substrates."

"In this paper, the transmission characteristics of a ferrite stripline are investigated in comparison with those of an ordinary dielectric substrate stripline, Also, both \"short\"-end and \"open\"-end reflection problems of a ferrite stripline are solved by means of the eigenmode expansion method; the results, which are confirmed by experiments, show that there is a large difference between the two reflection coefficients. For the short end, very little reflection occurs. Finally, as a practical application, a new type of EG mode isolator based on these results is proposed."
"The well-defined and repeatable electrical properties of single-crystal sapphire make it an attractive substrate material for microstrip, but its dielectric anisotropy constitutes an important design complication. This paper describes investigations into the quasi-static characteristics of single microstrip lines on sapphire substrates cut with a specified orientation. To account for anisotropy, a new permittivity parameter epsilon/sub req/ is introduced, which is a function of the Iinewidth to substrate-height ratio W/h. The variation of epsilon/sub req/ with W/h is derived by finite-difference methods. Universal curves for microstrip on correctly orientated sapphire are presented, showing 1) epsilon/sub req/, 2) the low-frequency limit of effective microstrip permittivity epsilon/sub e0/, and 3) the characteristic impedance of the line Z/sub 0/, all as functions of W/h."
"Dispersion measurements on microstrip lines with characteristic impedances between 10 and 100 Omega are described, covering the frequency range 2-18 GHz. Single-crystal sapphire cut with a specified crystal orientation was used as the substrate material. Microstrip effective permittivities were calculated from the resonant frequencies of open-ended straight resonators using a technique which eliminated end-effect. The experimental results are compared with some recent dispersion theories. An empirical dispersion formula is independently developed, and is shown to provide well-fitting curves for all the measured dispersion results."
"A passive remote-sensing method is proposed for the measurement of the electric-field distribution within a biological sample. The instrument analyzes the intermodulation spectrum reradiated by a diode imbedded within the sample exposed to a dual-frequency illumination. Experimental results in a waveguide system indicate that the relative intensities of the intermodulation products are a unique function of the field intensity at the diode. These results are also used to determine the basic scattering properties of the diode. A low-power free-space apparatus is described which exposes the principal problem associated with this method: the inadvertent generation of intermodulation frequencies. Isolation techniques are described which eliminate this problem. Finally, an analysis of a complete system shows that at 910 MHz fields can be measured in 4.0 cm of soft tissue, tan delta = 0.5, without exceeding an incident power density of 10 mW/cm/sup 2/."
"Empirical relations are given for the hysteresis (B-H) loop of microwave ferrite toroids in terms of their measured properties (B/sub r/, B/sub m/, and H/sub c/) and for the trajectory that B follows when flux drive latching is used. These relations also apply to minor loop switching. Finally, an idealized analysis of flux drive latching is presented and is shown to compare well with experiments for the number of voltage pulses of fixed width and amplitude needed to reverse the remanent flux."
"This short paper describes experimental results derived from a newly devised branch-guide directional coupler using a TE/sub 01/-mode semicircular waveguide. The length of an experimental 0-dB coupler is about 150 mm, which is one-third shorter than the conventional coupled wave-type 0-dB coupler, and the loss is decreased in proportion to the reduction in length. Using this coupler, it is possible to manufacture more compact millimeter-wave diplexers with reduced insertion loss."

"In an interesting paper Erickson has demonstrated how perturbation theory can be used to improve the accuracy of the beam-wave theory of the open resonator. Specifically, two defects of beam-wave theory are considered. The first is that the equiphase surfaces of beam-wave theory are not spherical, the second is that the wave function employed is only an approximate solution to the wave equation."
"A general method of calculating the power absorbed by a rectangular sample of material within the microwave field of a stripline is developed. Equations which account for the sample's disturbance of the otherwise uniform plane-wave field of the stripline are given, and restrictions on sample size for best accuracy are stated in terms of stripline dimensions. Power absorption measurements are made on a 0.775 x 1.04 x 1.7-cm sample of seawater over the 1-2-GHz range and compared with calculations made using the equations developed."

"A solution to Maxwell's equations subject to boundary conditions on counterwound helical wires is achieved. The helices are contained in a cylindrical surface that is concentric to a perfectly conducting center conductor of circular cross section. The permittivity of the annular region may be different from that of the external region. The excitation is taken to be symmetrical about the cable which leads to a considerable simplification of the formulation. The key step is to recognize that the assumed form of the current on the thin helical wires is a spatial harmonic expansion that leads to a doubly infinite expansion, in such harmonics, for the resultant fields. The inherent complication of the problem results from the intercoupling between the spatial harmonics of the helix currents. Various generalizations of the theory are also indicated."
"Maxwell's equations can be cast into a basic differential operator equation, the curlcurl equation, which lends itself easily to variational treatment. Various forms of this equation are associated with problems of practical importance. The formulation includes the treatment of loss-free anisotropic media. The boundary conditions associated with electromagnetic-field problems are treated in detail and the uniqueness of the solution is discussed. A functional is derived for the curlcurl equation in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates."
"This paper presents a perturbation method for determining the modes and the propagation constants of TE and TM waves in inhomogeneous dielectric waveguides whose index distributions depart from well-known profiles; e.g., a parabolic profile for which exact solutions can be obtained. Applying the variable-transformation technique to the wave equations, the wave-equation problem is transformed into the related-equation problem. The approximate solutions of the wave equations are obtained solving the related equation. The method is applied to the analysis of lower order mode propagation in a near-parabolic-index medium. The first-order field functions and the second-order propagation constants are given."
"Schottky-contact microstrip lines (SCML) are a special type of transmission line on the semiconducting substrate: the metallic-strip conductor is specially selected to form a rectifying metal-semiconductor transition while the ground plane exhibits an ohmic metallization. Thus the cross section of SCML is similar to that of a Schottky-barrier diode. The resulting voltage-dependent capacitance per unit length causes the nonlinear behavior of such lines. In this paper a detailed analysis of the, slow-wave propagation on SCML is presented, including the effect of metallic losses. Formulas for the propagation constant and characteristic impedance are derived and an equivalent circuit is presented. Conditions for slow-mode behavior are given, particularly taking into account the influence of imperfect conductors and defining the range of many interesting applications. Experimental results performed on Si-SCML are compared with theory."
"Theoretical analysis of a waveguide-post mounting configuration employed for high electronic (varactor) tuning of a transferred-electron-device oscillator is presented. The resulting two-port-coupling network representation is also used to derive the impedance of the post structure as an obstacle to the dominant TE/sub 10/ mode in the waveguide. Obstacle measurements conducted on the post structure for the incident TE/sub 10/ mode are found to be in very good agreement with the theory. This network representation is then applied to a practical transferred-electron-device oscillator reported elsewhere. It has been able to successfully explain the characteristic features of the oscillator. It is observed that the main source of discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental characteristics could be attributed to a lack of knowledge of the precise values of the package parasitic elements. The nature of the theoretical varactor-tuning characteristic predicted by the model is discussed and indicated for a particular configuration."
"A new, integrated approach to microwave design is presented involving concepts such as optimal design centering, optimal design tolerancing, optimal design tuning, parasitic effects, uncertainties in models and reference planes, and mismatched terminations. The approach is of the worst case type, and previously published design schemes fall out as particular cases of the ideas presented. The mathematical and computational complexity as well as the benefits realized by our approach is illustrated by transformer examples, including a realistic stripline circuit."
"This paper discusses the propagation of the magnetostatic surface wave in two ferrite slabs (namely, YIG and Ga-YIG) with different magnetic saturations, and considers a weak coupling in between them. The theoretical results are obtained by using the conventional perturbation technique which is subsequently supported by experiment. Further, the time delay in group velocity affected by the magnetic perturbation is treated theoretically."

An approximate form, which includes the edge-interaction capacitance of the strip, is obtained and is shown to reduce in an appropriate limit to a form obtained by other authors."
"A theoretical method is presented for the analysis of a coplanar waveguide, with thick metal-coating. Numerical results are given and compared with published data. It is shown that the metal-coating thickness of the coplanar waveguide causes an increase in wavelength and a decrease in characteristic impedance and that the changes are about the same as those of a slot line."
"In semiconductor IC technology, capacitance formed by the multilevel interconnection metal lines usually dominate circuit performance. However, for lack of accurate formulas, a numerical method usually has to be used to determine these capacitances. Two analytical capacitance formulas were derived using approximate conformal mapping techniques. One formula gives the capacitance of a finite-thickness metal line over a conducting ground plane, or over a silicon surface. The other formula gives the capacitance of the same metal line, but with an additional conducting metal line over it. The formulas are most accurate for metal lines whose width exceeds the dielectric thickness; accuracy increases with Iinewidth. They are accurate to 1 percent for a metal line whose width is comparable to the dielectric thickness. With these simple formulas, statistical distribution of the metal-line capacitances can be easily determined in a few seconds of computer time."
"A theoretical determination is made of the two-port equivalent circuit of a narrow strip located axially in a rectangular waveguide such that it extends partially or completely across the waveguide narrow dimension. The analysis is based upon derivation of a variational expression for a field quantity from which can be determined the reflection coefficient and the equivalent-circuit parameters. Experimental input susceptance values agree closely with the theory. The analysis shows that the T-equivalent network of a nontouching strip has a series-resonant shunt circuit. This element has application in filter and impedance-transforming networks, in planar circuits, and in fin-line structures."
"The coupling coefficients between open dielectric resonators in three useful dielectric-filter configurations, calculated from an electric rather than from a magnetic excitation of the fields, are given.

"This short paper describes effects of series inductance, shunt capacitance, and resistances associated with p-i-n diodes on the performance of reflection-type digital phase shifters using a shorted transmission line behind a shunt-mounted diode.

Expressions for phase shift in various cases are presented."
"The influence of the surroundings on the interaction between electromagnetic (EM) waves and biological tissue is examined by schematizing the environment by a perfectly conducting screen placed beyond the irradiated tissue. The effects of standing waves, which are created in this situation, are determined as a function of the electrical and geometrical parameters of the structure. In particular, the hazard increase due to the presence of the screen combined with a phase disuniformity of the incident field--an elementary schematization of the \"near-field\"--is pointed out."

Design equations describing the performance of this type of coupler are derived and allow the prediction of its matching and transmission properties. Numerical results using finite difference methods are presented for a three-line microstrip coupler made on an alumina substrate (k = 9.8). Experimental results for a 10-dB tbree-line coupler with a center frequency of 4 GHz show that its performance can be reasonably well predicted by the developed theory."

"A 5.2-GHz microstrip Gunn oscillator has been frequency stabilized by means of a novel microstrip discriminator and integrated feedback loop. A stabilization factor of 1000 was measured for the oscillator with art external Q of 50.

"An experimental study was done on the parameters affecting the frequency drift of a transferred-eletron-device (TED) controlled oscillator (VCO) after tuning from one frequency to another within its tuning band. For the VCO measured, reduction in frequency drift was observed and measured when: 1) the output power was reduced voltage either by decoupling the load or by using a lower power TED; 2) the voltage swing was restricted so as to draw less than 10 mu A forward or reverse current; and 3) when a varactor with a high Q was used. With 5-mW output the TED VCO had a frequency drift less than 2.5 MHz from 1 mu s to 100 ms when step tuning the frequency anywhere in the frequency band from 6.8 to 9.1 GHz."
"The change in the dc I-V properties of Gunn-flange microwave oscillators with a change in microwave load are shown to provide a method of measuring the physical properties of dielectric samples that only requires the measurement of dc voltages and currents.

Properties of a prototype system capable of measuring sample size with 8-percent accuracy are presented."

"Oscillators in the microwave and millimeter-wave region were constructed wherein the resonators consisted of sections of rectangular dielectric waveguide. While adding thin blocks of dielectric to increase the mechanical length of the resonator, the power output and frequency were measured. Using this technique, the experimental value of the wavelength in the longitudinal direction, lambda/sub g/, was determined. These experimental data were then compared with calculations predicted by optical theory. Good agreement was found where the bulk wavelength was small compared with the cross-sectional dimensions of the dielectric. If the half-wavelength in the dielectric was comparable with the dielectric dimensions, the values of lambda/sub g/ were greater than the theoretical values. In the process of carrying out these experiments, a new type of oscillator is described which provides a power ontput comparable with diodes in metal-walled cavities. In addition, the new dielectric cavities are simple in construction and are compatible with dielectric waveguide, image line, or microstrip systems."

"A low-loss ring-type channel diplexer consisting of two deformed ring cavities, three directional couplers, a TE/sub 01/ mode semicircular waveguide for the through channels, and a TE/sub 10/ mode rectangular waveguide for the dropped channel, has been developed as a channel-dropping filter for a millimeter-wave channel multiplexing network. The structure and experimental results of the diplexer are described, the design method is also discussed. Measurements show that insertion losses of the through and dropped (coupled) channels, and VSWR are less than 0.15 dB, 0.68 dB, and 1.12, respectively, for a diplexer centered at 81.91 GHz with 3-dB bandwidth of 800 MHz. Specifically, the through channel loss is reduced by half, as compared with a conventional rectangular waveguide diplexer, owing to the low insertion loss characteristics of the TE/sub 01/mode semicircular waveguide. As a result, an overall loss of a channel multiplexer, in which several channel diplexers are connected in tandem, is remarkably decreased, particularly at higher frequencies covering W-120 GHz."
"The characteristics of a rectangular waveguide bandpass filter (BPF) are not well known in the high-frequency range where higher order modes can propagate. In this paper, the frequency response of a BPF, composed of symmetric inductive windows, is investigated. The range of frequency under investigation covers the region where not only the TE/sub 10/ mode but also higher modes can propagate in the waveguide. A window with incident waves of various modes is first characterized by a scattering matrix. The matrix elements for various modes are obtained in a closed form by means of the variational method. The overall characteristics of the BPF are then obtained by calculating the product of these matrices. A design of a BPF with a stopband in the specified higher frequencies is proposed. Prototype production proved the validity of the theoretical investigation."

"The very-large-array (VLA) radio telescope utilizes a low-loss TE/sub 01/ circular waveguide transmission system. During the design of this system a coupler was developed which couples directly from a standard millimeter rectangular waveguide to the TE/sub 01/mode in highly over-moded circular waveguide. In contrast to previous couplers which used periodically spaced groups of coupling holes, this design wraps the rectangular waveguide in a helix around the circular waveguide to give a continuous array of coupling apertures for maximum coupling and a compact mechanical configuration. The helix angle is chosen to match the phase velocities of the rectangular and circular waveguide modes at a given frequency. In particular, couplers have been designed and fabricated which couple from WR-28 (26.540-GHz) and WR-22 (33-50-GHz) rectangular waveguides to the TE/sub 01/ mode in 20- and 60-mm-diam circular waveguide."

"Sealed reed contacts used in switching matrices are subjected to cable discharges which generate short arcs on make. This type of arc burns at a characteristic arc voltage. When the contact material is changed from pure gold to cobalt hardened gold, a large decrease, approximately 4 to 5 V, in the mean arcing voltage is observed. This decrease in arc voltage is associated with an increase in the probability of generating an arc. The arc characteristics are attributed to the presence of potassium in the gold electroplate. Desorption of potassium ions has been demonstrated in the hard gold remreed coatings at a rate of 109K+ sec-1 when the remreed was at 425°C. This last experimental observation helps to resolve the discrepancy between the hard gold mean arc voltage and the Kisliuk model."
"Studies were made of the arc termination current on the breaking contacts with an inductive load. Test contacts were 2 mm\\phicross rods of tungsten, gold, palladium, silver and platinum. The arc termination current was found to be closely related to an arc duration. The relation between the arc termination current and the arc duration was independent of the closed contact current (1-5A), the contact opening velocity (15-95 cm/s) and the slope of the arc current. When the arc duration was relatively short, the arc termination current increased linearly with the logarithm of the arc duration, and saturated at the specific value for each contact material. The saturation value was found to be nearly equal to the minimum arc current published by Holm. The arc termination current characteristics of silver-tungsten dissymmetric contacts were similar to those of the symmetric contacts of the cathode material."
"Particles formed by arcing on relay contacts both in various activating (organically contaminated) atmospheres and in central office atmospheres have been examined and analyzed by various techniques including Auger, thermal, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Carbonaceous particles were obtained on Au, Pd, Ag, Pd-Ag, Pd-S, Pd-Pb, Cu, Ni, AI, and C electrodes. In addition to these carbonaceous particles, metallic particles were also observed. Scanning electron micro- scopy revealed that small (< 450Å diameter) carbonaceous particles cluster to form larger (~0.1 µm diameter) particles. No distinction could be made between the laboratory and field produced particles. Contact activation or the enhancement of arc durations was observed to be possible for all electrodes examined using the nominally resistive break arcs in all the heavily organically contaminated atmospheres used (benzene, toluene, naphthalene and diethylphthalate at partial pressures of 100 torr, 30 torr, 0.09 torr and 3.8 X 10-3 torr, respec- tively)."
"The surface elemental composition of metal alloy contacts used in relays can change after the contacts have undergone arcing. In this work, selective area Auger electron spectroscopy was Used to analyze the elemental composition of the surfaces of Pd-Ag 40 wt.% versus Au capped Pd-Ag 40 wt.% metal alloy contacts, after they were subjected to arcing. When a contact pair consisting of Pd-Ag 40 wt.% as the cathode and Au capped Pd-Ag 40 wt.% as the anode is subjected to arcing, the Au capped anode surface is rich in Ag within a range of 6 wt.% to 14.5 wt.%, under an area covered by an Auger electron beam of 150µm diameter. Since the measurements are an integrated value over the area covered by the Auger beam, the silver could be concentrated in smaller clumps thus posing a tarnish problem. Tests were carried out by other investigators in this laboratory to determine the effect of the Ag segregation phenomenon[I]. Arced contacts were exposed to a sulfur containing environmerit and subsequent contact resistance and noise measurements did not show any Significant deleterious effects concerning contact performance."
"The microstructure and the X-ray diffraction properties were studied for tin electroplates deposited from bright acid baths as well as from a stannate bath. Aging at 50°C for 7 years, largely converted 5µm coatings to various intermetallic compounds: Cu6Sn5and Cu3Sn or Ni3Sn4depending on the substrate. Dull tin electroplates showed low contact resistance also after aging in spite of a large proportion intermetallic phase at the surface. Bright tin from acid sulphate baths of three different formulations and in particular a tin-nickel alloy coating showed high contact resistances after aging. It seems very doubtful that bright tin could replace gold. Dull tin or tin-lead may offer better chances."
"We describe the wear process which occurs when a P.C. card with copper/nickel/solder metallization is inserted into an edge card connector that has a contacting pin with a spherical gold alloy dot and a normal force of about 300 gms. The presence of a lubricant delayed the successive wear processes and reduced the amount of solder displaced during a single pass by minimizing the cold welding of solder to the gold dot. Fretting corrosion experiments were made using a simple test jig which permits the use of actual production cards and connector parts. The fretting test fixture provides a way of comparing and evaluating actual connector designs, as well as a means of comparing the effectiveness of various lubricant formulations."
"A study was made of the ability of various lubricants to provide adequate protection for non-noble metal coatings in hostile environments. These include high humidity, salt spray, and industrial air pollutants. Platings included various types and thicknesses of tin, tin-lead, silver, and gold. The results have shown that specific lubricants can provide a high degree of environmental protection and give performance equal to or exceeding that of gold. An optimum type of lubricant appears to be one containing both a liquid or mobile constituent and a semi-solid or immobile constituent"
"Metallic arcs were found to precede the firm contacting of electrical contacts which were closed without bounce. When the open-circuit voltages were below the ionization potential, the initiation of these arcs was found to depend on the presence of asperities on the .surfaces and on asperity contacting, melting, and pinching off by magnetic forces. The arc is thought to be initiated inductively when the molten metallic asperity contact is pinched off, and the electrode damage is similar to that produced by the arcing of opening contacts. Arcing could not be produced for exceptionally Smooth surfaces, or, for rough surfaces when the open-circuit potential was below the melting voltage of the electrode metals. In order to prevent damage to contact surfaces by melting or arcing, it is suggested that test potentials be limited to below the melting voltages, that the current be limited, the test circuits be designed to prevent inductively generated high voltage transients, and the contact surfaces be very smooth. In order to facilitate arc initiation in arc welding applications, it is suggested that the surfaces of electrodes and work pieces be roughened."
"The \"black art\" of carbon and graphite technology is yielding to the science of materials and applications. This review represents the present state of this art; and since carbon, graphite, and contacts come together in so many different ways and in so many important ways, it is reasonable to discuss them in this context. From the developments in this field have come materials which have made possible such applications as electric arc steel furnaces, jet aircraft engines, high altitude aircraft, inexpensive appliances, aluminum reduction pots, electric machines, electric traction, and many other uses. The purpose is to discuss the fundamental physical processes involved in sliding conduction, friction, and the electric arc, and the roles that carbon and graphite play. To put this together, we will first discuss the pertinent properties of carbon (1), then the physical and chemical effects involved in contact drop, mechanics, friction, temperatures, the electric arc, commutation, and wear (2). The principles are similar for both electrical and mechanical sliding contacts, that is, for brushes and for seals and brakes, so all will be included. Furthermore, in a suitable application, all of the applicable phenomena must be coordinated and within practical operating limits. In most applications, many of'the phenomena are interdependent in that they influence each other and are all influenced by the ambient conditions surrounding the ap- plication."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The members of PHP, and the entire profession are deeply indebted to Mr. Gustave Shapiro, of NBS, for his 20 years of dedicated service as Editor of the PHP Transactions, and its predecessor publications. A founding member of the original group which led to the PHP, Gus brought to his post as Editor not only a thorough technical knowledge of the field, but highly professional skills as an editor and judge of technical merit in publications. His wide national and international interests and contacts in the technological fields, and particularly in standardization and terminology, brought to PHP a rare gift in its Editor. That the PHP Transactions are today a widely respected publication of professional stature and archival value, is largely due to his efforts and dedication. We are all deeply indebted to him and express our thanks."
"Three different contact combinations were investigated: (a) Ag-W operated against Ag-CdO, (b) Ag-W-CdO contact pair, (c) Ag-Si3N4contact pair. A hot pressing technique was used to make the contacts for (b) and (c). The contacts were tested by switching a 20 A, 110V circuit and then examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope. It was found that: (a) The Ag-W vs Ag-CdO produced a high resistance contact pair which was the result of migration of a W layer onto the Ag-CdO contact. (b) The high temperature arc roots caused the W to reduce the CdO in the Ag-W-CdO contact material, which led to severe contact erosion and degradation. (c) The Si3N4dissociated in the switching arc and the Si formed a SiO2layer on the contact surface, which would eventually lead to a high contact resistance. These results are discussed in terms of the thermodynamics of the material combinations and their interaction with the switching arc."
"Insulating deposits are formed on operating relay and switch contacts when silicone oils are present on them. The characteristics of these tenaceous black films are discussed. Potential sources of silicone contamination are discussed and precautions which should be taken to avoid contact failures from the use of silicone materials are outlined"
"Bell Laboratories has recently approved the use of the 60% palladium-40% silver alloy as a replacement for pure palladium on the general purpose wire spring family of relays. In reaching this decision, many people at the Columbus, Ohio, location carried out exhaustive tests to compare Pd and this particular Pd-Ag alloy with respect to all relevant failure modes of electrical contacts. This paper reports on the tests relating to the tarnishing characteristics of this alloy and the resulting contact resistance behavior. Because the Bell System has many years of field experience with Pd that show generally satisfactory results, emphasis is placed on the relative performance of Pd-Ag and Pd in these tests. The results reported here are attributable to many individuals within Bell Labs who will be credited, but their findings are consolidated in one document in the interest of clarity. Coupons of Pd and Pd-Ag, as well as telephone type wire spring relays using various combinations of Pd, Pd-Ag and 22 karat Au, were exposed to tarnishing environments. Ellipsometry and Auger electron spectroscopy show limited sulfiding with slightly greater thickness on the Pd. Contact resistance measurements were made on the coupons using a Au probe and on the relays using a 22 karat overlay on one of the contact pairs. These measurements show no significant difference between the two materials. Relays from a telephone central office in New York City which were equipped with Pd, Pd-Ag and pure Ag in 1943 for a trial were studied in 1973. Data are presented which show that the Pd and Pd-Ag contacts are essentially equivalent."
  "The tapped analog delay (TAD) unit is a newly developed MOS integrated circuit designed specifically for the realization of nonrecursive filters. Such a device greatly simplifies the design of low-frequency filters. One such device has twelve delay taps, each tap separated from its neighbor by two sample periods. The analog input signal is sampled and each sample sequentially stored on one of a group of capacitive storage cells from which it is read out 2k sample periods later, where k is the tap number. Such a design avoids the problems of signal degradation and sampling-rate sensitivity which occur with charge-transfer devices. Outputs are buffered to provide flexibility and freedom from interaction. The basic function performed by a tapped line is that of convolution. As the incoming signal propagates down the line, it is convolved with the tap-weight function. The time-domain output is a measure of the correlation between the input and the function described by the tap weights. Device characteristics are reviewed and performance illustrated in a variety of fiiter designs including Iowpass and bandpass designs. Design procedures are reviewed and a comparison made between theoretical and realized performance."
"The process of contact activation or arc duration enhancement has been observed between various precious and nonprecious metals in highly activated (2 X 10-3- 100 torr) organic vapor-air mixtures. The results suggest that the enhanced arc durations observed under field, and some laboratory conditions, may only be an early stage of contact activation. A condition of extreme activation occurs where the duration of the enhanced arcing may be considerably reduced, and the voltage-time curves of contact opening show an almost continuous transition from zero potential to the open circuit voltage. At this stage the contacts are observed to have large amounts of carbonaceous particles present on them. This phenomenon of arc duration reduction under extreme activating conditions has been tentatively explained by considering a carbon particle bridging process between the electrodes."
"A wipe-reverse wipe technique, which may be incorporated in the design of electrical contact closure mechanisms, was found to markedly decrease the contact resistance of electrical switches even when very heavily contaminated with surfaces oxides, sulfides, or chlorides. The use of this technique reduces the sensitivity of electrical contact operation to environmental contaminants, allows a reduction in the closure force, and allows the substitution of inexpensive base metal's for precious metals in many electrical contact applications. Brass and copper-beryllium contacts were evaluated under several very highly contaminated conditions."
"The dissipation factor of polyethylene terephthalate film increases exponentially between ~70 and ~105°C, then decreases to about 160°C, then increases monotonically with temperature. It is shown that this peculiar dissipation factor behavior of PETP with temperature can lead to thermal runaway of alternating current capacitors if they are too large or the applied voltage is too high. NumericaI results for the critical condition have been calculated so that engineering designs for these capacitors can be checked for thermal stability. The calculations have been checked experimentally. The net result is that the center of large ac PETP film capacitors will operate at above 120°C. Above about 145°C at the center, a small increase in voltage or ambient temperature could force the capacitor into catastrophic thermal failure."
"The presence of iron or other impurities in mica is known to degrade the quality of mica capacitors. Insulation resistance, capacitance, and loss factor stability are frequently used as a measure of product quality. Mica, as a raw material, may be graded in quality by prescribing limits on structure defects and staining or color. These tests are slow, costly, and subjective in nature. Where high reliability is required, a more precise indicator of basic mica quality is desirable. A relatively simple and rapid technique based on the absorption of ultraviolet light has been developed. A dual beam spectrophotometer is used to make a comparison of the transmission properties of individual mica sheets with a reference standard. This allows the selection of high-quality individual pieces. Capacitors fabricated from mica showing low absorption have survived accelerated life tests. !n contrast, products intentionally fabricated from sheets showing anomalous absorption exhibit relatively short life. A continuous gradation in product quality has been demonstrated and a correlation between absorption properties and measured electrical parameters (insulation resistance, loss stability, and capacitance stability) has been established."
"The conductors on a printed wiring board can play a significant role in removing heat from electrical components. This paper describes a method of estimating the impact such conductors have on component temperatures. It provides a series of equations and charts for estimating the thermal resistance from one end of a conductor, through the major heat paths to the ambient. The analysis accounts for the effects of temperature gradients within the conductor and within the board. Curves of thermal resistance for typical printed wiring board conductors in a natural convection environment are given. An example problem is also given and the result, using the charts, is compared to the result obtained using a finite difference computer solution. Agreement from the two approaches is within 4 percent."
"An accurate straightforward technique is presented to compute thermal radiation from finned heat sinks. A set of graphs is included to aid in the computational procedure. The analytical approach presented compares favorably with experimental data."
"As part of a thick-film characterization study, a solderability test-program was initiated utilizing the meniscograph. The meniscograph test measures the changes in wetting force as a function of time, and thus affords a description of the kinematics of the wetting phenomenon. Difficulty was encountered in the derivation of unique parameters which provide consistent statistical comparisons. As an alternate to selecting a time interval from the meniscograph trace as a measure of wetting rate or only qualitatively comparing traces, as some investigators have done, we have evaluated the approach of measuring the slope of the trace replotted so as to yield a straight line fit. A plot of the logarithm of a normalized wetting force versus time has generally afforded the best fit. To evaluate the analytical techniques, a large number of meniscograph tests were conducted employing copper, nickel, and Kovar substrates using both tin-lead and lead-indium solders; and rosin flux with varying activity. With the wetting rate estimated on the basis of the logarithmic line fit, the tests have consistently ranked solder systems with regard to substrate solderability and the activity of fluxes. Calculated equilibrium contact angles were found useful in interpreting the meniscograph traces."
"Thin-film nickel-chromium resistors have been trimmed using the fluid jet from an air brush. Micrometersized distilled water droplets impinge on the resistor surface at high velocity, eroding away resistor material, thereby increasing resistance. The need for top hats is eliminated. Substrate damage and the hot spots which result from trim-line cuts are avoided. Trimming up to 230 percent has been achieved on narrow (0.0012-in) resistors. Test results at power densities up to 6000 W/in2indicate that power density ratings as high as 2400 W/in2are feasible."
"This paper describes an infrared technique and an analogical method to determine the maximum temperature of a beam-leaded integrated-circuit chip, mounted on a ceramic carrier. The infrared technique employs a color thermogram camera to map the stepwise temperature distribution of a heated surface. From the color-digitized thermograms the chip temperature rise over the ambient air can be computed with the aid of thermocouple measurements. The color thermograms also help evaluate the thermal resistances of the chip and the ceramic carrier, which are used in the thermoelectric analogical analysis of steady-state heat flow from the chip t,o the surrounding air under free convection condition. The chip temperature rise as evaluated by the thermoelectric analysis checks reasonably well with the infrared and thermocouple measurements. These two methods have their respective advantages in determining the temperature of integrated-circuit chips."
  "The properties and design of a metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitor are reviewed and its performance is compared with that of conventional MOS and metalized ceramic capacitors. The MOM structure is fabricated by growing a high-performance dielectric such as SiO2or Si3N4on silicon and metalizing the dielectric with several mils of copper, after which the silicon \"handle\" is removed and replaced with copper. The MOM capacitor has the high capacitance density, low dielectric loss, and low temperature coefficient properties of thermally grown dielectrics. In addition, the resistive electrode loss is minimized by the replacement of the Iossy silicon with copper. The electrode loss for the MOS and MOM capacitors is evaluated as a function of frequency and is in good agreement with the loss estimated from the surface sheet resistance. The series resistance of an MOM capacitor is only 10 percent of that measured for a comparable MOS structure. MOM capacitors have been successfully soldered into circuits; these assemblies have been temperature cycled and high temperature stressed."
"A multipin connector has been modified to include lightning arresting features. A dielectric stimulated arc is used for rapid electrical, breakdown in the connector prior to any damage to downstream components. This report reviews the connector design basis and concept, and summarizes the electrical test results obtained during development and production. Electrical testing included insulation resistance, high voltage rise rate (to 500 kV/µs) tests and simulated lightning (over 200 kA) exposures. The lightning arrestor connector has been effective under all tests maintaining an insulation resistance over 100 M, and shorting fast rise lightning induced voltages to about 1000 V. A final test of a missile system showed the lightning arrestor connector effectively protected missile components against simulated lightning."
"A compact and lightweight quick-starting ballast for a 20-W 24-in fluorescent lamp has been developed. Adding capacitance across an ignition coil reduced the starting period to 53 percent of the original value. This new ballast produced better power factors. No noise was produced by this new ballast."
"Data useful in the design of dc capacitors have been taken on the voltage for arcover VAacross a distance d on the surface of an insulating polymer film. It is found that VA (kV) = 3d (mm)0.55for arcover in air at p = 83 kPa, T = 20°C and 30 percent RH. The equation applies to buried foil capacitors and to an electrode configuration that simulates a single turn of an extended foil capacitor. For extended foil capacitors it is found that VAincreases as 1.0d0.90."
"The behavior of the contacts of the Panel Bank Switch, in which a phosphor-bronze brush slides into position over brass terminals, is studied in a simple laboratory apparatus in which the mechanical operation of the switch is simulated. Contact resistance between brush and terminal is measured as a function of the number of brush-terminal encounters. Terminal wear and static friction are measured concurrently in selected cases. Contact resistance behavior with and without lubrication by U.S.P. petrolatum, chosen after extensive corrosion tests, is studied. Sparing and copious lubrication, the effect of additives, and substitution of silver for one or both contacts, are studied. It is concluded that organic contamination or lubrication of the contacts, in conjunction with slide, lead to the development of a coherent film, probably oxide, bonded to the wear track by products developed as a result of chemical reactions induced by sliding, a process known as mechanical activation. If oxide is prevented from forming or if the products of mechanical activation are dispersed, the rate of development of an insulating film can be greatly reduced."
"A new center-tapped microresistor with high power density capability, good stability, and a high degree of inherent reliability is described. The resistor consists of a 0.075 in2chip 0.022 in thick with two equal-value sputtered tantalum nitride photoetched resistors. Gold-plated copper leads are thermal pulse bonded to evaporated chrome/gold bonding pads. The resistive film is protected with an epoxy coating. Performance data include 10 000 h life at 70°C with 0.2 and 0.4-W dissipation with resistance changes generally under 1 percent. This is equivalent to 70 W/in2of substrate area and up to 1300 W/in2of resistive area. Also included are 10 000 h of 150°C thermal aging, temperature cycle, moisture performance and short time overload, and hot-spot temperature rise versus power dissipated. With heat sinking, short time overload of up to 3 W was successfully applied. Tolerance as manufactured is ±5 percent and stability is generally equivalent to M I L 10509 characteristic C. The product design, manufacturing process, fabrication equipment, and process controls are described. Included are a continuous sputtering machine, an autobonder, an autotester, and a \"binstock\" qualification procedure. Two unusual applications are described. In one, pairs of center-tapped resistors are used as stripline attenuators or as stripline terminations. They are useful at frequencies up to approximately 2 GHz, In the second application, they are used in an ultrahigh-speed computer. All signal conductors are treated as transmission lines and terminated with the microresistor. The computer size is such that just under 500 000 resistors are required. Operation of this computer leads to interesting conclusions regarding field failure rate and require- ments."
"This paper reviews the results of a number of investigations which have been performed to evaluate the use of an RTV silicone rubber dispersion for the encapsulation (conformal coating) of integrated circuits containing beam leaded silicon integrated circuit (SIC) devices. The dispersion consists of approximately 67-percent xylene and 33-percent solids by weight. The investigations described include: 1 ) measurement techniques for and typical values of the properties of the as-received dispersion and of the material after curing; 2) the determination of the suitability of the dispersion to be applied to integrated circuits containing SlC's by a flowcoat technique, and of its capability to completely fill under SlC's after curing; and 3) the performance of encapsulated test specimens and circuits in some initial accelerated bias-humidity and temperature cycling tests. In addition, several other factors relevant to determining the suitability of the dispersion for particular circuit applications are briefly dis- cussed."
"This study was directed at the parallel gap welding response of a series of gold and platinum-gold thick-film conductor materials which were subjected to various peak temperature/belt speed firing profiles. The parallel gap welding was conducted using a variety of weld voltage/pulse duration settings and a nominal 0.05-mm-thick by 0.38-mm-wide pure gold ribbon. Evaluation of the welds was determined through a 90° peel test. From the resulting data the following conclusions were reached. 1) Parallel gap welding is a viable approach to gold ribbon interconnection to thick film. 2) In general, thicker fired films respond better to parallel gap welding. 3) Sensitivity to firing profile, as reflected by parallel gap weld strength, is a characteristic of each specific thick-film material which must be determined and properly optimized. 4) Sensitivity to weld parameters is a characteristic of each specific material and should be optimized with firing profile. 5) The Pure gold conductor materials are not as satisfactory as platinum-gold conductors for parallel gap welding."
"The effects of heat treatment between 74°C and 130°C on the dc breakdown voltage (VB) and the change of capacitance with temperature have been determined for capacitors with Mylar film insulation. Some effects of the temperature of heat treatment on discharge life and on the rate of water desorption from rolled capacitors were also determined. It was found that the breakdown voltage decreased from 11.5 kV dc for 0.4-/µF capacitors with 50.8 µm of insulation processed at 74°C to 9.9 kV for similar units processed at 130°C. The change in capacitance associated with a temperature change from -55°C to 74°C was 8.5 percent for the units processed at 74°C and 6.5 percent for units processed at 130°C. Evidence of burning at tabs and at random locations along the foils was found when capacitors heat-treated at 74°C were unrolled after failure in discharge tests. No similar evidence was seen in units processed at 100°C and subjected to the same tests. Finally, results from the water desorption studies show that drying of Mylar capacitors can be accomplished in 10 h or less at temperatures below 74°C. Hence the choice of temperature for processing must be based on a consideration of all requirements placed on a capacitor."
"Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) has been used to determine the chemical formulation of thermally grown films on cobalt hardened-gold electroplate (150°C/8000 h). K2S04 (or SO3) ~ 60-Å, thickness has been identified overlaying a 50-Å-thick CoO layer on cobalt hardened gold. It was found that the dielectric breakdown voltage of this complex film depends on contact force. At Iow contact forces (~10-2N), electronic (as opposed to thermal) dielectric breakdown events are observed at a critical voltage of ~ 3.5 V. I-V characteristics are typically nonohmic. Mechanical film breakdown is evidenced by ohmic I-V characteristics. A statistically important number of mechanical breakthrough events are observed at 0.2-N contact force."
"A closed-form theoretical expression has been derived for the conductive and convective thermal resistance of frequently used electronic component and package covers. Numerical results are plotted in a manner that is applicable to a variety of devices such as flat packs, dual-in-line packages, and ceramic circuit cards,"
"A noncontact variable resistor having fast response and small nonlinear distortion is needed for applications such as autoattenuators or autoequalizers. For these purposes, the voltage controlled variable resistor (VCR) based on the junction FET was investigated. This paper describes the-design results achieved by a VCR and also discusses the behavior of this device with regard to nonlinear distortion and aging characteristics. S/D2and S/D3(S: signal level; D2, D3: second and third harmonics level) were over 70 dB in the resistance region of 40-600\\Omegaand were improved by 10-30 dB, compared with the conventional FET. Resistance aging is less than 1 percent at 100°C after 1000 h."
"In this paper, several structures that can be used to protect MOS-LSl chips against electrostatic discharges (ESD) are examined experimentally to determine some of the possible specification tradeoffs that result in improved overall performance. It is shown that by using structures able to withstand larger energy discharges at the expense of their voltage-clamping characteristics, higher overvoltages can be handled. Additional protection is possible by incorporating a spark-gap device on the chip-carrying module. Conditions under which this hybrid combination is effective are ex- amined."
"The advantages, disadvantages, and the reasons for the limited usage of thick-film capacitors are discussed. The electrical and environmental properties of a glass-passivated high dielectric constant (HiK) (~1000) capacitor which does not require hermetic packaging are described. Design criteria for achieving a Iow-cost thick-film capacitor-resistor-conductor network are presented. These include: 1) satisfying multiple circuit requirements; 2) using many capacitors, resistors, and conductors per circuit or per processing operation; 3) using Iow-cost materials, sealing techniques, and processes; 4) achieving high yields. An example is cited of a television tuner circuit on a 2 X 3 X 0.040-in substrate utilizing 47 resistors, 30 capacitors, 8 crossovers, and 1 ground plane in which the substrate also serves as a printed,circuit board for mounted discrete components."
"A unique active bandpass filter is described, which is capable of selecting any of 12 different frequencies as defined by a digital input. This device utilizes both thick- and thin-film technologies to their best advantages. Filtering is performed by a state variable active filter circuit designed around a custom linear integrated circuit (lC) and precisely matched components. Frequency selection is accomplished by a custom MOS device. Functional laser trimming of both thinand thick-film resistors is employed to adjust circuit characteristics to extremely tight tolerances. The finished device must be packaged to maintain a high level of frequency stability over a wide range of environments. Two different packaging techniques are presently being successfully employed. The first is a standard chip and wire technique and the second relies on devices which are prepackaged in small ceramic carriers. This circuit, whose size, weight, and cost were previously impractical in discrete form, is presently being produced in production volumes."
"The design of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors is generally very straightforward and simple. This design normally yields the Iow-frequency parameters such as capacitance, dissipation factor, and insulation resistance. As the frequency increases, however, the loss caused by the resistance of the electrodes can become significant, and the inductance of the electrodes can impair the effectiveness of the capacitors. In this paper the frequency dependence of the dissipation factor is developed for both conventional chip Capacitors and discoidal capacitors. Equivalent series inductance is also developed and generalizations made about it. Finally, some conclusions are arrived at concerning optimum or better designs for high-frequency use."
"This paper describes a new method for increasing the anode area and hence the capacitance density of aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors. Frequency, temperature, voltage, and life characteristics of the improved capacitors are pre- sented."
"This paper describes the development of a new type thermal printing head. The main features of this paper are as follows. 1) The heating element is a Ta2N thin-film resistor coated with a SiO2-Ta2O5double layer. The SiO2layer prevents oxidation of Ta2N; the Ta2O5layer, which rubs directly against the heat-sensitive paper, is hard enough to resist abrasion. 2) A theoretical calculation revealed that the thermal time constant can be controlled by changing the thickness of the heat insulating layer. It was found that a glazed alumina ceramic substrate has the most suitable thermal properties. 3) A beam-lead diode array and a crossover structure have been developed to satisfy the electrical interface requirements of both the thermal printing head and the external logic."
"Electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) in semiconductor devices produced by the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used to image sub-surface device features and to measure certain material parameters, This paper presents a simple method of calculation for estimating the magnitude of EBIC signals. EBIC signals from silicon p-n junction diodes are compared with the results of the calculation, The application of EBIC to more complicated device structures is discussed."
"The electrical characteristics of a two-level X-Y superconducting stripline network over a common superconducting ground plane have been examined as a possible means of two-dimensional interconnection for Josephson tunneling logic (JTL) [1]. Despite the crossover structure, each superconducting stripline has a unique characteristic impedance and is suitable for transmission of very high-speed Josephson tunneling-logic signals. Special test vehicles were fabricated with 1-mit linewidth technology [2] to study line delay and crosstalks."
"An analysis of the stress and deformation in gold beam leads during thermocompression bonding is presented. The analysis isolates two particular bonding processes for study. One has the beams on opposite sides of the chip bonded simultaneously and the other sequentially. Since strains are encountered that are two orders of magnitude greater than the elastic limit, the beam leads are modelled as a work-hardening rigid-plastic material. The independent variables are yield strength, plastic modulus, beam dimensions, chip length, and chip rise (or, bugging height). The dependent variables include strain, beam-centerline geometry, and the force and moment transmitted to the chip. A parametric variation is performed, which shows that increases in yield stress will significantly increase the maximum transmitted force and moment. Increasing beam thickness significantly increases the transmitted force and moment as well as the maximum compressive and tensile strains. Increasing the beam length or decreasing the chip rise will significantly decrease the maximum strains. The results are of interest in the analysis of device damage which occurs during the bonding process. Furthermore, the solution for the beam configuration will be useful in elastic and plastic analyses of power and thermal cycling problems involving goldbeam-lead devices."
"Both encapsulated and unencapsulated Ti-Pd-Au thin-film conductors on AI2O3substrates were biased in an 85°C 80-percent RH environment contaminated with Cl2. The encapsulant was an RTV silicone rubber. During exposure to the corrosive environment, leakage currents between adjacent conductors were periodically measured and recorded. Leakage currents for the unencapsulated specimens increased with time, and many were shorted after approximately 400 h. In contrast to this behavior, there were no increases in leakage currents for the silicone rubber encapsulated conductors. At the end of the test, selected specimens were examined using a light microscope and an SEM with X-ray capability. No metal migration was observed on the encapsulated samples. The unencapsulated conductors showed dendritic growth between the electrodes; X-ray analysis showed the growths to consist of both Au and Pd. It is concluded that the RTV silicone encapsulant effectively prevents high leakage currents and subsequent metal migration on biased Ti-Pd-Au conductor specimens exposed to a moist Cl2environment. Unencapsulated samples are rapidly degraded under the same conditions with the main failure mechanism being metal migration."
"The development and use of an accurate method for the measurement of moisture in microelectronic packages has uncovered many myths related to the assembly and processing of microcircuit packages. The myths indicated a general lack of awareness on the part of the manufacturer and user of the basic physics and chemistry of moisture adsorption, desorption, and leak mechanisms. This paper describes the mass spectrometer method developed to measure moisture in electronic packages, and experiments conducted to disprove myths associated with moisture trapped within the hermetically sealed cavity."
  "This paper describes the fabrication, characterization, and analysis of a hybrid microcircuit to be used as a signal amplifier and conditioner for an IR tracking system. The entire circuit is integrated on a 1 X 2-in alumina substrate using thick-film resistors and conductors, some chip resistors in critical locations, chip capacitors, and monolithic integrated-circuit (IC) operational-amplifier (op-amp) chips. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the entire circuit. The transfer functions of each of the stages is derived. The predicted gain. peak and the shape of the measured bandpass agree well with experimental results. The computer simulation using an opamp \"macromodel\" [1] gives results very closely resembling the measured bandpass, and underscores the utility of computer circuit simulations in IC development. Stability and hybrid layout considerations are discussed. The noise figure is measured as a function of frequency for the given system source impedance of 5 M\\Omegaand also for 0.5 M\\Omegato indicate the dependence of the noise figure on source resistance. The dominant sources of noise in the amplitier/filter and low-noise design considerations are discussed."
"An important consideration for the hybrid-circuit manufacturer is the power dissipation of active devices on the circuit. Heat generated in the junctions of the devices affects circuit reliability, performance, and current handling capability. Theory of the thermal characteristics of various chip interconnect methods is available, but results are too generalized to be of much use for circuit design. This paper presents a theoretical consideration, but is primarily an experimental comparison of the thermal characteristics (\\thetajs,\\thetaja, Pmax) of solder-bump flip-chip and chip-and-wire attachment techniques under comparable conditions. The 2N2222A transistor electrical specification in flip-chip and in chip form (MMCF2222A and MMCS2222A, respectively) was chosen for the comparison. Substrates were prepared to offer a thermally fair representation of actual usage in the manufacture of hybrid circuits. The effect of conformally coating and directly heat-sinking chips through a substrate is also evaluated. Thermal resistance data from a previous experiment for flip chips, standard chips, and beam leads is offered for com- parison."
"Noise in thick-film resistors is interpreted by comparison to experimental and theoretical results previously reported for noise in metals and semiconductors. This comparison provides an explanation for the observed dependence of noise on the thick-film-resistor geometry and the 100-fold increase-in noise amplitude over that of metals and semiconductors This comparison indicates that mobile-charge interactions with traps are an inherent feature of charge transport in thick-film resistors."
"Service failures of sealed mercury switches in relays may occur by \"sticking\" or by \"bridging,\" Analyses by scanning-electron-microscope microprobe and by X-ray diffraction revealed that bridging failures in certain make,before-break-type switches can be due to the accumulation of particles of NiHg4in the mercury which, because of increased viscosity, may form a quasi-steady bridge between the movable and fixed contacts. Doping of the mercury with copper and tin was proposed as a solution to the bridging problem based on the analysis of failed switches and the knowledge gained from previous studies of liquid-mercury/solid-metal interactions [1]. The results of an accelerated laboratory test and a field trial comparing the electrical characteristics of undoped and doped switches confirm that the failure mechanism is thermally activated. The undoped switches were prone to bridging failure. Prevention of bridging failure in doped switches is attributed to the preferential formation Of a tin-bearing layer which inhibits the dissolution of nickel and the subsequent formation of a viscous slurry of NiHg4in mercury."
"This paper describes the physical layout, process sequence, and component properties of a universal active filter designated the standard tantalum active resonator (STAR). This active-filter building block was realized as a hybrid integrated circuit (HIC) using tantalum thin-film technology. Several different circuit configurations are possible using only one set of process photomasks and one HIC. This can be accomplished by a wide range of precise resistor values through the use of laser trimming and various interconnecting schemes for the components on the HIC via the printed wiring board. The STAR circuit is comprised of nine laser-adjustable tantalum thin-film resistors totalling a maximum of 1 M\\Omega, two 5100-pF tantalum capacitors, and one operational amplifier. The capacitors are formed by anodizing tantalum to 190 V and depositing NiCr-Pd-Au as the adherent counterelectrode. The resistors are made from 300-\\Omega/\\Box$^b$tantalum oxynitride film which is preaged at 350°C for 1 h. The single-substrate RC process is amenable to batch processing and precision tuning, making it attractive for high-level production of precision filters. New thin-film design criteria and process developments permitted this circuit to be fabricated on a 16-pin dual-inline package ceramic substrate which could be packaged for machine insertion with commercially available insertion equipment."
"Hybrid microcircuits designed for use in radars require metallized vias to interconnect front-side tantalum-nitride chromium-gold thin-film networks with metallized back-side ground planes on 95 X 114-mm alumina substrates. Processes were developed for fabricating precision holes in alumina substrates, metallizing substrates on both sides and through the via, and dry-film lithographing 6- µm-thick gold to linewidths and spacings of 127 µm. Front- and back-side resistance measurements through the via were used to determine the surface finish and metallization thickness on the via wall. Hole fabrication methods investigated included ultrasonic drilling in already-fired alumina and punching or drilling holes in green alumina before the firing. Photolithography techniques were developed which protect both sides of the substrate and the vias from etchants and delineate a thin-film network consistent with critical hybrid-microelectronic-circuit (HMC) linewidth tolerances for RF circuits. A metallization technique was developed, using a planetary system, to evaporate chromium-gold on the front and back side (while simultaneously depositing the metallization on the via wall). Front-side-to-backside resistance measurements through the via showed that the manufacturing methods used were compatible with a stable low-resistance connection for RF circuitry in hybrid microcircuits."
"This paper describes the thermal analysis of a hybrid microcircuit to be used as a signal amplifier and conditioner for an IR tracking system. The details of circuit fabrication and an analysis of the electrical and noise performance of the circuit have been presented in a previous paper [1]. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the use of computeraided analysis to determine the thermal performance of the circuit and to present a computer-aided approach to the thermal design of hybrid microelectronic circuits. Thermal analysis and measurements are made, revealing the temperature distribution and power-dissipating capability. These results also provide design guidelines for the layout of heat-dissipating devices such as amplifier chips. Package convection and radiation as well as internal heat conduction are modeled using node point analysis. Temperature measurements provide verification of the thermal models."
"The results from a unified study of high-voltage damage and low-frequency noise in thick-film resistors are presented. Material microstructure and the mechanisms for charge transport and I/f noise are discussed to provide a basis for the interpretation of the experimental results. Experimental results showing a definite relationship between high-voltage damage and low-frequency noise are presented and interpreted. It is shown that noise parameters are extremely sensitive to the condition of interfacial regions within the conductive phase of the thick-film material. Because of this sensitivity to conductive-phase microstructure, noise measurements are recommended as a diagnostic tool for research on thick-film materials and as a diagnostic tool for quality-assurance efforts in the production environment."
"Tin dioxide thin films were deposited by dc glow discharge sputtering using a compressed powder target. The conductivity of these films varied from 3 X 10-5\\Omega-1cm-1for pure SnO2to 1\\Omega-1cm-1for SnO2which was doped by adding 9 percent Sb2O3to the target. Transparency was above 85 percent. Films sputtered from targets containing more than 10 percent Sb2O3were highly resistive as a result of lattice disorder. Such films, however, became conductive upon post-deposition heat treatment. This paper presents the results of the heat treatment of these antimony-doped tin dioxide films. The variation of resistivity with temperature was found to be very complex. It not only depends on the previous heat-treatment history but also on the ambient sputter gas used during deposition. Heating beyond 400°C resulted in a general decrease in the conductivity of SnO2films. Below this temperature, successive heating and cooling in nitrogen caused increased conductivity and improved stability."
"Thin-film multilayer high-energy-density capacitors have been constructed using a pyrolytically deposited phosphosilicate glass as the dielectric material with aluminum as the electrode material. Other electrode materials such as gold, chromium, and silicon were studied to determine the best electrode for this application. A careful study was made of the behavior of the oxide with respect to the formation of microcracks and pin holes in order to eliminate those problems. It was found that the stresses in undoped SiO2were too great to permit its use in this application. Capacitors having an area of 1 cm2with up to 20 layers were constructed using a doped oxide with a P2O5concentration of from 7 to 10 percent."
"Theoretical and experimental methods are used to predict the thermal properties of an air-cooled integrated-circuit package with a large LSl type of chip. A previously reported three-dimensional solution to the differential equation for steady-state heat transfer has been extended to include composite media with up to four layers of unequal thickness and thermal conductivity. The theoretical results are used to calculate the detailed thermal characteristics of a 1.3 X 0.6-in package with a 0.17-in square chip. Geometric and physical considerations include the effects of ceramic thickness and thermal conductivity, chip dimensions, lead conduction, and heat-sink variations. An empirical technique is used to determine the forced-convection heat-transfer coefficients for a variety of extruded aluminum heat sinks. The effects of fin length, air velocity, and number of fins per inch are measured."
"The ultraviolet (UV)/ozone cleaning procedure is shown to be an effective method of rapidly removing a variety of contaminants from surfaces. It is a simple-to-use dry process which is inexpensive to set up and operate. It can produce · clean surfaces in air, at ambient temperatures. The experiments were performed on quartz and metal surfaces. The contaminants which were successfully removed include oils and greases (including silicones), fluxes, skin oils, and contamination adsorbed during prolonged exposure to air. The experiments were aimed at defining the variables and determining the optimum conditions for producing clean surfaces by UV irradiation. The important variables are: the contaminants initially present, the precleaning procedure, the wavelengths emitted by the UV source, the atmosphere between the source and sample, the distance between the source and' sample, and the time of exposure. For surfaces which are properly precleaned and placed within a few millimeters of an ozone-producing UV source, the process can consistently produce a clean surface in less than 1 rain. Experiments performed with two low-pressure mercury discharge UV sources, one which generates ozone and one which does not, indicate that the combination of short-wave UV light plus ozone produces a clean surface substantially faster than either short-wave UV light without ozone or ozone without UV light."
"A packaging technique which makes use of a wiggly (sawtooth) conductor-edge geometry between adjacent conductors has been developed for the fabrication of microwave hybrid microcircuit-directional couplers and phase shifters. The new technique provides approximately a 20-percent space saving as well as a significant improvement in circuit fabrication."
"External leads intended for thermocompression (TC) bonding to Au-metallized thin-film circuits are typically Cu-based alloys plated with Au or a combination of Ni and Au. The objective of this work was an evaluation of the Ni/Au system to determine the optimum plating thicknesses for reliable TC bonding. Also investigated was the minimum Au thickness necessary for TC bonding when the Ni diffusion barrier was omitted. Four criteria were evaluated: initial bondability; bond strength after accelerated aging; susceptibility to cracking in a 90° bend test; and fatigue behavior. The test vehicle was a 32-lead dual-in-line package utilizing alumina substrates metallized with Ti/Pd/Au films and Cu lead frames (CDA 102 and 110) electroplated with Ni and Au in the ranges of 0 - 41 µm and 0.4 - 20 µm, respectively (0 - 1630 and 15 - µin, respectively). Optimum strength and reliability with the Ni/Au system were obtained for a Ni plating thickness of 0.25 - 1.3 µm (10 -50 µin) and a minimum Au plating thickness of 2.5 µm (100 µin). For the special case of zero Ni thickness, acceptable TC bonds were obtained with as little as 0.6 µm (25 µin) of Au."
"Only by a judicious combination of compatible materials, technology, and \"production state of the art\" can ruggedness, reliability, versatility, and utilization be realized. This choice can only be achieved through high-quality system · engineering which covers the architecture, detail engineering, manufacturing, inspection, and maintenance of the product throughout its entire service life. The thesis is that the electrical, electronic, thermal, mechanical, construction, test, and rework characteristics must be given proper weight at all points in the design. This paper presents an argument for uncased packages of multichip large-scale integrated (LSI) devices as the best solution for the high-reliability system applications presented here."
"Beam-lead semiconductor and passive devices have been utilized in hybrid microcircuits (HMC) to provide higher reliability. This is derived from the beam-lead device's improved bonding integrity plus the silicon nitride coating which reduces sensitivity to contaminants; however, their size requires special handling techniques to prevent handling damage. Other failure modes exist such as cracked nitride, pinholes in the nitride, inadequate plating, and smeared metallization. After two years of production usage totaling approximately 150 000 devices, The Bendix Corporation's Kansas City Division has compiled significant data on beam-lead devices including small-signal and power discrete semiconductors and digital integrated circuits. These failure modes are characterized and precautionary measures are described to minimize failures in HMC usage."
"This paper describes the various thin-film processes that are being used to produce microwave integrated circuits, both microstrip and lumped element systems. The technologies described involve a combination of vacuum evaporation or RF sputtering, photolithographic, electrochemical, and microbonding processes used in sequence to achieve integrated resistor, capacitor, and conductor networks. Stable thin-film integrated nickel-chromium resistors are achieved with good microwave behavior. The usual conductor and interdigital capacitor systems are gold with either nickel-chromium or titanium underlay. The microwave circuits are produced on a variety of substrates which include alumina, ferrite, quartz, and sapphire. Some of the ancillary amplifier networks are produced on glass, A successful scheme for the fabrication of integrated anodized aluminium capacitor structures, compatible with the nickel-chromium/gold resistor conductor system, is outlined as well as preliminary results of such systems at GHz frequencies. Assembly techniques used for incorporating add-on components including chip capacitors, overlay couplers, chip resistors, and microwave semiconductor devices are included. Substrate preparation and the packaging of prototype assemblies are also included. Examples are shown of components and systems where the various technologies have been successfully applied. Data on the manufactured components are given, showing that good reliable performance can be achieved. While the processes are typically operated in the environment of a workshop for circuit development, they are adaptable for large-scale manufacture."
"There has been an increase in the use of thin-film technology for the preparation of microwave circuits since it permits the realization of very complex circuitry with precision, reliability, and economy. The requirements for the realization of such circuits have made it necessary to extend the state of the art of the hybrid technology in many areas. Two new substrate types (fine-grain alumina and fused silica) and low-loss conductor systems that are both solderable and thermocompression (TC) bondable were introduced. Further complications which were overcome included bilevel patterns with laser-drilled plated via-holes, the control and measurement of the alumina substrates dielectric constant, and the use of laser trimming to adjust small geometries of tantalum nitride (Ta2N) termination resistors. Precise pattern delineation of conductors by laser machining, sputter etching, and selective plating was evaluated and the latter process was found to be the most economical and reliable, since the selective plating technique depends on good photoresist delineation, resist properties were evaluated with special attention given to the variation of linewidth as a function of exposure conditions and resist adhesion during the plating of the gold conductors to prevent underplating. The line shape of the resist was also determined as a function of exposure, development, mask-to-substrate distance, and postbake conditions. Linewidth tolerances such as ± 2.5 µm on fused silica and ±5.0 µm on alumina were routinely achieved. Microwave integrated circuits (an 18-GHz downconverter, a 1.7-GHz amplifier, a filter, and a demodulator) prepared by this technique are illustrated and their performances are discussed. These circuits are used in a digital transmission system currently under development."
 "During the last ten to fifteen years, active and passive device screening has received considerable discussion. The literature contains well over 100 papers dealing with various aspects of part screening and the cost effectiveness of such programs. Although these reports are generally favorable toward the decision to utilize some type of 100-percent testing beyond the manufacturers normal end-of-line testing, most commercial systems and some military systems are routinely assembled using unscreened parts. From this it appears that management's decision variables must differ substantially from those discussed in the various pro-sereening papers. This paper attempts to provide a general means of evaluating a screening program's effectiveness which utilizes terminology appropriate to product management decisions. Any systematic evaluation should provide guidance relative to three areas of concern. 1) Should device screening be imposed for product X? 2) If so, which screens should be used? 3) How can we keep the program dynamic and sensitive to the changing technology? A benefit/cost model utilizes information developed by marketing, manufacturing, and reliability engineering to estimate the total impact of a screening program and provides a quantitative basis for decision making."
 "As electronic components become smaller, quality and cost control problems within a manufacturing operation become correspondingly larger. This happens because there is a direct relationship between shrinking component size and shrinking yields. As yields become lower, they also become more erratic, which phenomena, in turn, makes it very difficult to control production costs and provide pricing guidance to Marketing. Achievement of high yields and low production cost are almost an impossibility in a thin-film hybrid microcircuit operation without the combination of a strong quality assurance program and an accurate cost accounting system. This paper will outline the process problems encountered as component size gets smaller making it increasingly difficult to maintain circuit integrity and resolution. The necessity of maintaining process controls with well executed quality and cost programs will be reviewed."
"The test operation is normally limited to the smallest number of tests that effectively measure the ability of the device to meet or exceed a set of reliability and performance criteria. Diagnostic testing, on the other hand, attempts to characterize the device in order to identify fault mechanisms to provide feedback for yield and/or performance improvement. Utilization of the capabilities of computercontrolled automatic test equipment can generate and reduce data to provide meaningful diagnostic feedback while maintaining production throughput."
"This paper elucidates user oriented test philosophy for LSI microprocessors. Also, a low-cost incoming inspection tester is described. The significant difference between this and available testers is the use of probabilistic scheme by which the instruction, data, and control signal mixes are generated. This approach reduced significantly tester hardware and supporting software without compromise of overall test performance."
  "The general problem of reducing data available in the integrated circuit environment is addressed. One can consider the circuit to be essentially composed of identification and performance data. Opportunities exist at every level of manufacturing and testing to aid in the final interpretation of the results. Without disturbing the technology or actual circuit design, some general methods for improving testing techniques are discussed. Examples of data reduction and presentation techniques are given where relation between performance and identification can be seen."
"This paper presents a history of computer control in discrete manufacturing and focuses on the computer control problem at the lowest or machine tool level. Succeeding papers will give the specifications for a control computer at this level, derive a system architecture to meet these specifications, and evaluate the computer performance when applied to a control problem. The objective of the total set of papers is to present a computer architecture, based on microprocessor concepts, which will be efficient in a total manufacturing environment involving a hierarchy of control computers. The proposed computer would function at the lowest level of this hierarchy."
 "The 300 professionals of the Israeli Industrial Automation Institute provide technical consultation to modernize industry. In addition they provide courses in industrial automation to 20 000 students each year."
"A detailed analysis of screening tests of integrated circuits, transistors, and diodes is presented. Included is a cost-effectiveness study of various types of \"screens.\""
"This paper presents an analysis of the computer requirements for the lowest level computer in a hierarchical control structure. The objective of the paper is to identify those points of discrete manufacturing process control which require special consideration and to give the impact of these requirements on the computer architecture. The areas which are investigated are the instruction set, input/output system, interrupt structure, and computer-to-computer communications."
 "The character of the board industry is changing. The days of the wet process area being called \"The Swamp\" are coming to a close. We no longer see the frantic pace of process improvements that existed three years ago. This will necessitate a change in the types of projects board engineers work on. In this paper, one aspect of a new board operation installed in Puerto Rico will be discussed. That aspect is a material-handling system. The following questions will be dealt with: 1) Why we decided to db it, 2) What it looks like, and 3) How it is working-Is it saving money."
"In the real world, no component manufacturer can attain loo-percent yield of final product (regardless of how well the device is designed, the scrutiny of incoming materials, or the care taken in assembly)-the user then must decide whether he can tolerate standard product quality levels. This will to some extent depend upon the supplier's integrity, to a large extent upon the interest in reliability shown by the user, and by the complexity of the user's system. The writer feels that for certain categories of components (resistors, capacitors, most low-current diodes, logic or switching transitors, etc.); screening, burn-in, and/or 100-percent testing is not economical. Other specific categories such as: IC's (in reality subsystems), power devices SCR's, Triac's, transistors, etc.), hybrids, memories, microprocessors, etc., lend themselves to the philosophy of paying an insurance premium (screening, burn-in, testing) at the lowest level of assembly. Too often the true costs of board, system, or field repair is swept under the rug for personal or political reasons. This paper is intended to cut a swath through the statistical and accounting morass to enable some sound technical and manufacturing decisions to be reached."
  "Minicomputers are used in controlling test equipment for process adjustments and final testing of complex passive filters and active amplitude equalizers. Automated testing reduces test time by factors of 5 : 1 which can yield a pay-back period of less than one year. These facilities can be used for adjusting and testing insertion loss or gain, return loss, current drain, continuity, and other active parameters. The operator interacts with the computer control through a simple keyboard terminal controlling the options available; i.e., data printout, adjustment or final test. Software is written at machine level to allow the use of 8K machines. The software includes a monitor and individual product programs. Each test facility uses an individual computer for its control center because it reduces software and hardware complexity."
"A significant consideration to be made with respect to the application of a flexible circuit is the degree to which it can be bent when incorporated into the next level of assembly. The application of stress analysis techniques to arrive at a flexible circuit design that will be structurally sound for a given set of parameters and materials relative to the required application is discussed."
"A design for a Level (1) control computer, is presented. The objective is to define a system which meets the requirements of the control environment set forth in an earlier paper. The areas which are discussed are the input system, the output system, the memory system, and the central processing unit."

"When electrically thin conductors of different cross sectional size meet, the continuity of current is assured by Kirchhoff's current law. Additional conditions must be imposed on the derivatives of the currents or the charges per unit length. The nature of the required conditions is determined from an analysis of the tapered antenna."

"The effect of higher order interactions in the coupling between twoH-plane sectoral electromagnetic horns on the field distribution at the aperture of the transmitting horn is calculated using the point matching technique. A nonsingular integral equation for the induced current in the receiving horn, due to the initially incident wave from the transmitting horn, is formulated using a conformal transformation which maps the cross sectional contour of the receiving horn onto two circles on which the induced currents are finite. The solution leads to a modified field distribution in the transmitting aperture which is then employed in Hu's near-zone power transmission formula to compute a gain correction factor forH-plane sectoral horns. It is shown that the correction factor oscillates about that reported by Chu and Semplak with an amplitude which increases for smaller separation distances."
"The microwave depolarization arising in the process of oblique reflection from a painted surface has been found insensitive to the dielectric constant of the paint and is not negligible for higher microwave frequencies if the polarization requirement is very stringent; the calculated cross polarization of a 19-GHz example agrees with the measured result. The approximate reflection coefficients also suggest lenient tolerance for the uniformity of the paint layer on reflector antennas of largeF/Dratio."
 "In this communication the design of an array consisting of dipoles having an arbitrary orientation is effected; the dipoles are specified by five coordinates, three positional and two directional. The intensity of the electric field is considered as both i) a vector in Euclidian space and ii) a vector of ann-dimensional vector space. Some examples follow."
"Reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface between two homogeneous materials is modified when a transition zone of linearly increasing permittivity is inserted between the half spaces. Mathematical expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients are derived for waves at arbitrary incidence angles and polarized either in or perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Discontinuities in permittivity at the transition zone boundaries are allowed. There is efficient transmission between the two half-spaces for transition zone thicknesses of a wavelength or greater. For sharper changes the matching layer has diminishing effect and the wave-interface interaction is characterized by the difference in properties between the two half-spaces. Examples applicable to lunar radar astronomy and airborne terrestrial remote sensing are used to illustrate the relationship between wavelength and thickness of the transition layer. A lossy transition layer also masks the electrical properties of the far half-space. Using only reflected power it is generally difficult to distinguish between dielectric models which are lossy and those which are gradational. For the lunar case, however, experimental values of attenuation indicate that gradations in soil permittivity should be observable."
"The unimoment method is applied to calculate the scattered fields of dielectric cylinders of arbitrary cross section or of inhomogeneous material. The basic technique of the method is the use of the finite element methods inside a mathematical circle, which encloses the inhomogeneous body. The fields outside are expanded in the usual cylindrical harmonics. The interior and exterior problems are then coupled at the circle. The versatility is increased greatly by introducing the method of \"inhomogeneous element.\" The advantage of the proposed method is the simplicity and efficiency in programming. The validity of the computer program has been verified by comparing results with calculations from other methods for i) an off-centered circular cylinder, ii) two circular cylinders, and iii) a circular cylindrical shell."
"After a brief summary of the existing theory on microwave attenuation and cross polarization by rain and of the supporting experimental evidence, the paper gives a physical explanation of raindrop canting. It is shown that vertical windgradients are a cause of canting. A model for the dependence of windspeed on height is then employed to calculate actual values of canting angle and to investigate the dependence on windgradients, height above terrain, and the type of terrain. A generalization of the expressions for cross polarization as a function of raindrop canting angle is given, which allows actual cross polarization calculations to be made with the model. Results for sample cases on horizontal and slant paths are given to show the relative importance of various parameters."
"Diffraction of an arbitrary electromagnetic optical field by a conducting curved wedge is considered. The diffracted field according to Keller's geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) can be expressed in a particularly simple form by making use of rotations of the incident and reflected fields about the edge. In this manner only a single scalar diffraction coefficient is involved. Near to shadow boundaries where the GTD solution is not valid, a uniform theory based on the Ansatz of Lewis, Boersma, and Ahluwalia is described. The dominant terms, to the order ofk^{-1/2}included, are used to compute the field exactly on the shadow boundaries. In contrast with the uniform theory of Kouyoumjian and Pathak, some extra terms occur: one depends on the edge curvature and wedge angle; another on the angular rate of change of the incident or reflected field at the point of observation."
"The reconstruction problem of perfectly conducting bodies from far-field scattering data is discussed within the context of physical optics. The general bistatic scattering configuration, discussed in this investigation, adds inherent complexity to the problem but also introduces possibilities not present in the backscatter limit."
"The development and application of a numerical technique for the rapid calculation of the far-field radiation patterns of a reflector antenna from either a measured or computed feed pattern are reported. The reflector is defined by the intersection of a cone with any surface of revolution or an offset sector of any surface of revolution. The feed is assumed to be linearly polarized and can have an arbitrary location. Both the copolarized and the cross polarized reflector radiation patterns are computed. Calculations using the technique compare closely with measured radiation patterns of a waveguide-fed offset parabolic reflector. The unique features of this technique are the freedom from restrictive feed assumptions and the numerical methods used in preparing the aperture plane electric field data for integration."
"It is shown that testing Pocklington's equation with piecewise sinusoidal functions yields an integro-difference equation whose numerical solution is identical to that of the point-matched Hallen's equation when a common set of basis functions is used with each. For any choice of basis functions, the integro-difference equation has the simple kernel, the fast convergence, the simplicity of point-matching, and the adequate treatment of rapidly varying incident fields, but none of the additional unknowns normally associated with Hallen's equation. Furthermore, for the special choice of piecewise sinusoids as the basis functions, the method reduces to Richmond's piecewise sinusoidal reaction matching technique, or Galerkin's method. It is also shown that testing with piecewise linear (triangle) functions yields an integro-difference equation whose solution converges asymptotically at the same rate as that of Hallen's equation. The resulting equation is essentially that obtained by approximating the second derivative in Pocklington's equation by its finite difference equivalent. The authors suggest a simple and highly efficient method for solving Pocklington's equation. This approach is contrasted to the point-matched solution of Pocklington's equation and the reasons for the poor convergence of the latter are examined."
"A design method is presented for the determination of continuous line sources which will yield sum patterns consisting of a narrow main beam and sidelobes whose individual heights can be adjusted to any arbitrary specification. The method is based on a generalized Taylor pattern which is perturbed in successive iterations until the desired pattern results. For practical cases the convergence is rapid, and an economical computer program of general applicability has been written which will terminate when the desired pattern has been achieved within a specified tolerance, at which point a final pattern and aperture distribution are printed out. The theory is illustrated by several cases of practical interest."
"A leaky-wave antenna using a grounded dielectric-artificial dielectric (AD) slab is described. The propagation constant of this structure is evaluated by solving the dispersion relation. Various modes supported by this structure are discussed. This type of leaky-wave antenna is capable of producing extremely narrow beamwidths. An antenna using the dielectric-AD is compared with the AD antenna reported in [1]. It is found that for similar characteristics this modified antenna structure requires smaller thickness than the AD antenna. Theoretical and experimental results for radiation characteristics of this type of antenna are compared and found to be in good agreement."
"Two different types of antenna systems for a distress buoy for use in the maritime satellite communication system (MARSAT) are described. The buoy radiates signals alternately on the frequencies 2182 kHz (medium frequency (MF) beacon) and 1.65 GHz (Lband beacon). TheLband antennas had to be combined with the MF antenna of a commercial buoy. The antenna systems have been tested with success during the application technology satellite (ATS-6) experiments and during a previous European Space Research Organization (ESRO) balloon communication experiment [1]."
"The problem of finding the field behavior near a conducting edge in the presence of an arbitrary number of isotropic dielectric wedges is considered. Conditions under which finite and infinite fields can exist are derived. A principal finding is that for four or more dielectrics it is possible to have finite fields at a knife edge. It is shown that the problem is equivalent to finding the fundamental resonance frequency of a resonator formed from a succession of coupled transmission lines."
"The optimum radiation of a lens antenna with an array feed ofMelements is desired, which will exhibit maximum gain in a number (k) of specified directions and nulls in other (j) specified directions. This optimum is not derived; however, a condition for the optimum is shown to be some superposition of just (k + j) individual radiation patterns where each individual pattern is obtained by a separate excitation set of allMfeed elements such that the gain is maximized in each of the (k + j) directions. (The feed array excitation set for each of the (k + j) maximum gain individual patterns is derived.) Thus the number of unknown feed excitation coefficients is reduced fromMto (k + j)."
"Using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, computer-reconstructed images of radio sources are obtained from conventional height-gain measurements over line-of-sight propagation paths for microwave frequencies of 2 and 4 GHz. The height-gain curves are regarded as one-dimensional microwave holograms."
"The reflection coefficient is calculated at normal and oblique incidence for a sine-squared pulse with the middle layer having a frequency dependent complex permittivity. The two important results of the theoretical investigation are the importance of the frequency dependence of the complex dielectric constant in pulse propagation studies as well as the unique effect that occurs at some angles of incidence at parallel polarization in which the power from the second interface exceeds the primary reflection from the first interface."
"Using Keller's geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) the field diffracted by a wedge is infinite at the shadow and reflection boundaries. In general, uniform diffraction coefficients must be used to provide continuous fields at these boundaries. In this communication it is shown that by properly adding the singular contributions from a pair of adjacent edges, Keller's diffraction coefficients yield a continuous far-zone field at the reflection boundaries of a polygonal cylinder illuminated by a plane wave. Furthermore the procedure is justified by noting that the uniform diffraction coefficients reduce to the Keller diffraction coefficients for this case."
"Adopting the earlier work of Kouyoumjian's Ohio State group, as recently reviewed and extended by Rusch, an explicit expression for the radiation field in the back zone of a typical parabolic dish antenna is obtained. Evaluation of this expression directly in the back for both the ideal 100 percent aperture efficiency feed and for an arbitrary, feed gives (in conjunction with the known front field for the 100 percent case) the front to back (f/b) ratio for the arbitrary feed case of(f/b) = G + T + K - Ghorn. HereGis the gain of the dish with the arbitrary feed,Ghornis the on axis gain of the feed,Tis the feed's average pattern edge taper relative to on axis,K = 20 \\log_{10}{\\sqrt{1 + 16(F/D)^{2}}/4(F/D)}(all being in decibels), andF/Dis the ratio of the focal length to the dish diameter. Comparison of this result with measured values for dishes ranging from 6 to 15 ft in diameter operating over a 920 MHz to 14 GHz range gives an agreement within several decibels in most cases."
"The method of moments (MM) technique is used to compute the radiation and scattering from asymmetrically excited perfectly conducting bodies of revolution. The numerically calculated results are experimentally validated for a cone-sphere from 1 to 3 GHz. The pitch-plane radiation patterns of a cone-sphere for multiple excitation, including the effects of antenna phasing and location, are also computed."
"The mutual coupling solution of dual and quad ridged waveguide is described for an infinite array environment. The method of analysis is the numerical solution of integral equations for both the eigen solution and the boundary matching problem. In addition to numerical results, comparison of theory with waveguide simulator measurements is also given."
"Measurements of the radar backscattering coefficient of densely planted fields of sorghum were conducted using a radar spectrometer mounted atop a 20 m truck-mounted boom. Data were collected at 8 frequencies between 2 and 8 GHz, 2 polarizations (HH, VV) and 6 incidence angles (0\\degto50\\degfrom nadir in10\\degsteps). The objective of the experiment was to determine the radar response to soil moisture variations underneath a continuous vegetation canopy with soil surface roughness and canopy height as parameters. Four fields were prepared having different surface roughness-plant height combinations. After sprinkling the four fields with water for about 12 h and allowing adequate time for the water droplets on the leaves to evaporate, radar backscattering measurements were recorded for the four fileds on a rotating basis for several days. Analysis of the scattering data indicates no discernible sensitivity to soil moisture variation, which is attributed to severe attenuation by the continuous cover vegetation canopies (the shortest plant height was 90 cm). It was observed, however, that the backscattering coefficient exhibited a definite diurnal variation pattern. Furthermore, this pattern appears to be sensitive to frequency and incidence angle but lacks sensitivity to polarization."
"This is a brief review paper on microwave radiometry as a remote sensing tool in geoscientific investigations.

"A rather simple and general analysis allows us to calculate directly the transient response of many different radiators of practical interest in the time domain without the knowledge of the corresponding time harmonic solution. For example, we present exact expressions for the transient near- and far-field around small circular current loops involving arbitrarily time-varying excitation. The resulting convolution integrals have been numerically evaluated for step function currents with finite rise time, thus showing the influence of finite loop radius on the radiation field in comparison with the ideal magnetic dipole."
"Existing 15.3 and 16 GHz path diversity gain data for earth-space propagation paths are used to generate an empirical relationship for diversity gain as a function of terminal separation distance and single terminal fade depth. The agreement between the resulting closed form expression and the data is within 0.75 dB in all cases."
"It is shown that repeated application of Chandrasekhar's transformation can extend the range of frequencies over which a classical perturbational solution of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation converges, when the refractive index differs from unity within a fixed finite interval. A conjecture (supported by a computational example) is made that, for a given form for the refractive index, there is a particular number of Chandrasekhar transformations which optimizes the range of convergence. The computational significance of the results is discussed."
"Sources of error in polarization measurements on electromagnetic waves are investigated. A method is described for correcting the error in the measurement of a Faraday rotation in propagation from a geostationary satellite by calibrating the receiving system."
"The relationship between the induced field ratio (IFR) of a cylinder and aperture blocking of a constant-phase aperture by cylindrical struts is discussed. An analytical technique is presented whereby the IFR of rectangular cylinders can be calculated using the method-of-moments with internal constraint points. An experimental technique using a forward-scattering range is used to measure the IFR's of square and circular cylinders in an anechoic chamber. These experimental results are compared with the theory, and their implications on aperture blocking losses and boresight cross polarization are discussed."
"The geometry considered is an infinite conducting circular cylinder carrying a steady current and surrounded by an annulus of circumferentially magnetized ferrite. Plane wave scattering is treated for bothE- andH-polarized incident waves yielding scattered fields which contain both polarizations. The scattered fields for the ferrite structure, and in fact for a general class of radially inhomogeneous and anisotropic structures, are shown to be symmetrical. The cross polarized scattered fields are shown to exhibit nulls in the forward and backward scattering directions. Numerical results are presented for the scattering cross section and the relative energy in each polarization. It is seen that considerable control of the scattered fields can be exercised by varying the steady current in the conducting cylinder."
"Electromagnetic field penetration through apertures is investigated numerically and experimentally. The coupling to a cable located behind an aperture is determined in terms of the open circuit voltage of the cable. A square and a circular aperture are taken as examples, and the open circuit voltage is calculated and verified by an experiment. The apertures are modeled by employing Babinet's principle and solving the complementary flat plate problem using wire-grid modeling. Comparisons with radar cross section measurements were also made to verify the wire-grid modeling."
"The wavefronts of a point source of radiation that is immersed in a turbulent atmosphere become distorted and deformed as they propagate outward. The phase surfaces incident on an unobscured collecting aperture therefore will not be perfectly spherical, but instead will be aberrated in some way. We have expanded this phase profile in a set of orthonormal functions closely related to the Zernike polynomials and then determined the respective power spectra of the time dependent expansion coefficients. The results show, for all spectra, a sharp cutoff off^{-11/3}for frequenciesf > (\\nu/2R), where\\nuis the wind velocity transverse to the point source and the receiver, andRis the aperture radius. In particular, for the tilt component expansion coefficients, this result differs from the usual phase difference power spectra previously used by many workers."
"Rain attenuation measurements of 19 GHz were made on four tandem links at Musashino district near Tokyo. This paper discusses the characteristics of rain fade probabilities on tandem links. A multiplicative factor which reduces the worst case estimate of adaptive probabilities developed. This factor increases (approaches 1) as the rain attenuation becomes deeper. The measured modification factor at a rain attenuation of 30 dB was about 0.81 on four tandem links, 0.82 on three tandem links, and 0.88 on two tandem links. It has a tendency to saturate with an increase in the number of links."
"An analysis of the problem of synthesizing nonuniform linear arrays is carried out; in this, the orthogonal method is combined with the analysis of the functions by Chebyshev's polynomials. The method development can be applied to any array and for a variety of patterns, including those given by Dolph's method. Finally, some applications are presented."
"An approximate general formula to calculate the directivity of an antenna based upon theE-plane andH-plane patterns is proposed. For narrow beam patterns, the directivity is expressed in terms of the half-power beam widths of the main patterns. The better approximation of the formula presented here over the geometrical mean formula is pointed out."
"A banded matrix iterative solution method for linear simultaneous equations arising from thin wire moments problems has been applied to a variety of multiple wire configurations. Compared to Gaussian elimination, solution efficiencies around 5 to 10 and up to 23 have been obtained for problems with 100 unknowns for a solution accuracy of 1 percent. Greater efficiencies are obtained for less accurate solutions. Reasonable far-field patterns are found from currents with 30 percent error. The method is intended for large problems, for which good efficiencies are expected. Application of the method requires some expertise at the current stage of development."
"The transient response of an infinite cylindrical antenna and scatterer is obtained by time gating a time-dependent electric-field integral equation for thin wires of finite-length. The driving point current and broadside radiated field approximate the driving point voltage in the antenna case, while the current excited in the scattering case approximates the time integral of the incident field. This approximate integral relation is used to estimate currents excited on cylindrical structures without employing the complete integral equation solution procedure."
"The cutoff frequencies and modal fields of dually polarized crossed rectangular waveguide are calculated numerically and the cutoff frequencies verified experimentally. Symmetry arguments and group theory are used to explain mode degeneracies and mode splitting. The single mode bandwidth is 38 percent of center frequency for both polarizations when the guide dimensions are chosen appropriately. For applications where symmetric excitation is assured, bandwidths in excess of 2:1 can be obtained."
"Several methods are developed and used to evaluate potential integrals which occur in the numerical solution of electromagnetic scattering or radiation from electrically thin elements. Exact and approximate representations are obtained for potential integrals with constant, trigonometric, or polynomial distribution functions. Each integrand and integral is displayed graphically over a broad range of parameters. The computational accuracy and efficiency of these representations are compared with direct numerical quadrature."
"A slotted flange mounted on a waveguide has been studied for use as a feed with deep reflectors. TheE-plane patterns have large beamwidths and are reasonably square. A comprehensive device, consisting of a slotted flange mounted on a square aperture, has been designed and fabricated using the optimum slot width values of the slotted flange waveguide system. The amplitude, phase, and bandwidth characteristic of this device satisfy the requirements of a feed for deep reflectors."
"The design of a 400 MHz directional antenna for a space vehicle is presented. The design utilizes the spacecraft itself as an integral part of the antenna. The antenna has a gain of 4 dB over a dipole, a front to back ratio of 8 dB, and a - 6 dB beam angle of34\\deg. Design equations and experimental data are presented."
"A theoretical investigation of the influence of metal shields on antenna radiation patterns is performed. This study allows us to determine the proper dimensions of a circular cylindrical finite perfectly conducting shield placed on the ground around infinitesimal sources located at its axis, in order to reduce the ground-side lobe. Two different methods are applied in this study: 1) integral equation method (IE) and 2) geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). When the dimensions of the cylindrical shield become very large compared to the wavelength, the first method involves a very large matrix that is impractical for the present computers to handle. Under these circumstances, GTD may be shown to be a very useful approach. For the range of dimensions where both methods are applicable, a comparison between them is made."
"Suitable engineering expressions for the external impedance per unit length of a finite-length horizontal electric antenna located near the earth's surface are derived by employing finitely conducting earth-image-theory techniques. The results should be applicable to horizontal wire antennas employed in the ELF band (1 to 3000 Hz)."
 "A spatial filtering technique using layered dielectrics for the reduction of antenna grating lobes or sidelobes is introduced and developed. The filters are used as a radome at the array face, and can be synthesized to have Chebyshev behavior in the spatial domain. Data are given for the design of two, three, and four layer filters with various spatial passband ranges and ripple levels."
"Analysis is presented which substantiates the high correlation achieved in relating integrated water vapor and liquid water to brightness temperatures at frequencies near the 22.235 GHz water vapor line. The influence of atmospheric and surface variability is shown to be minimal over low emissivity sea surfaces. Determination of atmospheric water content using regression techniques is shown to follow directly from radiation transfer theory. Satellite data from the Nimbus-E Microwave Spectrometer (NEMS) aboard Nimbus-5 are compared with radiosonde water vapor measurements and cloud images recorded by the Temperature Humidity Infrared Radiometer aboard Nimbus 5."
"The accurate joint determination of the direction and strength of a point noise source when the mutual coherence function of its radiated field is spatially sampled atMbaselines by a correlation interferometer is considered. The measurements are corrupted by the combined effects of a) the additive background and receiver noises at the interferometer antennas and b) the finite integration time of a practical correlator. The problem is approached from a statistical point of view (as contrasted with beam forming techniques). First the probability density function of the measurements is derived. The source's two parameters (direction and strength) are then jointly estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Investigation of the estimates' properties shows that they are virtually unbiased with variances that effectively attain the standard Cramer-Rao (C-R) lower bound when the number of measurements exceeds a \"threshold\" which is a decreasing function of the measurements' signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The empirically observed fact that such a threshold is quite small, even at low SNR's, as well as the unbiasedness of the estimates, makes the performance of these (ML) estimates optimum for most practical applications."
"Thinning of phase shifters (the deletion of some individual phase shifters and the use of common ones to adjust the phase of more than one element) in a large phased array is a means for reducing circuit complexity and system cost. This practice gives rise to phase errors which cause a deterioration in the array pattern. One of the most objectionable results is an excessive rise in some of the sidelobes whose locations and magnitudes depend on the direction of scan and other array parameters. This paper introduces a method for determining the region and the extent of pattern deterioration when each phase shifter is used to control the phase of two elements in a linear array. A procedure based on the steepest-descent technique for an optimum reduction in the high sidelobes by breaking the regularity of the phase errors is also presented. The procedure is independent of the total number of array elements. Numerical examples are given."
"A novel technique-Volterra series analysis-is applied to the analysis of a nonlinearly loaded antenna. The electromagnetic field problem is first reduced to a network problem by application of the method of moments. The nonlinear network problem is then solved using the Volterra technique. A procedure with sinusoidal inputs for obtaining a time domain solution from the frequency domain solution without using fast Fourier transform techniques is demonstrated. Thei-vcharacteristic of the nonlinear load is approximated from scattered power measurements. The derivedi-vcharacteristic is then used to predict scattered power levels at different intermodulation responses of the loaded antenna."
"Two methods for analyzing antennas or scatterers having nonlinear resistive loads are discussed. The first is a direct time-domain integral equation approach, whereas the second involves the use of frequency domain data to compute the time-dependent currents and voltages across the nonlinear load. Both transient and time-harmonic excitations are considered in the sample problems illustrated here which involve a center-loaded linear antenna. Although it is difficult to do so with the direct time-domain approach, the second method of analysis may be readily applied to an arbitrary antenna whose frequency response is either measurable or calculable."
"The dominant term in the scattering pattern of anE-wave by a dielectric cylinder is known to be omnidirectional. In the present communication we investigate the next-order term ink, the wave number."
"TheTE_{11}mode coaxial waveguide or horn radiator provides a natural geometry for multiple frequency confocal feeding of a paraboloid reflector antenna system. Its radiation patterns, however, are generally characterized by unequalE- andH-plane beamwidths and highE-plane sidelobe amplitudes. These characteristics become increasingly more obvious for coaxial radiators designed to illuminate reflector systems requiring feeds with reduced fields of view, such as the symmetrical paraboloid reflector antenna with large focal-length-to-diameter ratio or the offset paraboloid reflector antenna. Left uncorrected, these feed characteristics severely limit the available antenna performance. Incorporation of a radial reactive iris in the aperture plane of aTE_{11}mode coaxial radiator has been found to produce rotationally symmetric pattern characteristics with reduced sidelobe levels. This paper describes an approximate technique for determining the radiation patterns of aTE_{11}mode coaxial radiator with a radial aperture reactance. Experimental results are shown that reveal the pattern improvements predicted by the analysis. A multiple frequency coaxial feed that employs radial aperture reactances is capable of providing the aforementioned reflector systems with a high performance capability."

"A computer program called DERIVE is described for the design of the reflecting surfaces of two-mirror radio telescopes. It calculates the shape of a secondary reflector to any given primary by use of geometrical optics, yielding zero path length errors for all paraxial rays. The only condition to be fulfilled is (for Cassegrain types) that incoming rays, after reflection at the primary, do not cross each other before reaching the secondary. Equations for this condition are given. This method can be used to improve existing telescopes at short wavelengths by correcting for the surface deviations of the primary reflector with a specially shaped secondary. The results of 17 calculated examples are described, for various types of deviations"
"Optimum resolution in the Doppler spectra of rotating targets is obtained by using an optimum aspect angle window from which the data for the Fourier transforms are taken. The width of the optimum aspect angle window depends on the location, relative to the axis of rotation, of the scattering center to be resolved, so that for optimum resolution a sort of focusing by choosing the appropriate aspect angle window is necessary. Formulae and graphs for optimum width of aspect angle windows and the obtainable resolutions are given. Typical applications of the scheme presented are in the experimental determination of the location, the strength, and the interaction of the scattering centers on a target. These in turn are of major interest, e.g., for the analysis and synthesis of radar cross sections, in glint investigations, and in target imaging."
"A basic problem in estimating the microwave attenuation over a satellite-earth propagation path on the basis of rain gauge data is that, for a given precipitation event, the attenuation and the rainfall records very often do not have consistent detailed correlation. Such inconsistencies can be greatly reduced if the falling speed of the rain drops, i.e., 2 to 9 m/s for drop sizes of 0.05 to 0.7 cm, is taken into account. Adjustments in time and drop size spectrum are needed for data collected from field rain gauges to realize the actual rainfall along the slant path for correlating rain gauge data with measured satellite signals."
"We show by suitable conformal mapping and appropriate boundary conditions that theHguide permits study on the Goubau line, theOguide, and the dielectric rod. By this method, we confirm a well-known result [10] and generalize about some new waveguides."
"The characteristics of some inhomogeneous lenses are investigated. The lenses covered are the Luneburg, the Eaton-Lippmann, and the Eaton. Radiation patterns and the bistatic scattering cross sections for the small-diameter lenses as well as the directivity and the distribution of the energy around the geometrical focus of the Luneburg lenses are numerically computed and examined in detail."
"A finite cylinder with arbitrary conductivity and permittivity is illuminated by an EM wave. The induced current in and the scattered field by the cylinder are determined based on the numerical solution of a tensor integral equation. An experiment has been conducted to verify the theory. Biological and metallic cylinders are emphasized in the study."
"A technique for modeling ground terrain is presented. The analysis is based on resolution of the ground in question into semi-infinite planes or strips. Using the half-plane solutions for diffracted radiation developed by Senior, Woods, and Bromwich it is shown that with slight modification, the effects of arbitrarily oriented dipole and ground planes can be considered. Application of the modeling is presented for instrument landing system (ILS) glide slope arrays. The results show close correlation between the theoretical and experimental DDM and signal patterns. For transverse half-planes the capture effect and sideband reference systems out-perform the null reference, whereas for lateral edges close to the antenna the reverse is shown to be true. This is in agreement with the relative ground currents characteristic of each antenna."
"A nonuniformly spaced array of 25 side-terminated vertical half rhombics is synthesized for the entire high-frequency band. The array is to be used for both transmitting and receiving, as a sky-wave Doppler radar for sea scatter measurements. The array has the capability for providing a maximum transmitting-receiving product gain in the order of 60 dB at low take-off angles, a product azimuth pattern with a nominal beamwidth of2\\deg, a40\\degsectoral coverage, a final product sidelobe level of -38 dB, and a grating-lobe level of -30 dB."
"A tutorial description is given of a procedure for synthesizing equiripple approximations to a sector pattern which is constant over the coverage region and zero elsewhere. This procedure, which represents a generalization of Dolph-Chebyshev synthesis, can be used to synthesize both zero phase and minimum phase approximations (with the latter yielding a better approximation to the desired magnitude function). Theoretical considerations and comparisons of recently constructed arrays suggest that the synthesized patterns have maximum rolloff at the coverage region boundary given constraints on the maximum allowable deviations from the desired pattern and the number of array elements. Extension to synthesis of more complex desired functions is discussed."
"The corrugated horn has been established as an antenna with low sidelobes and backlobes, rotationally symmetric patterns (for square pyramidal and conical horn shapes), and broad-band performance [1]-[9]. These properties make this horn useful for many applications. Previous studies have used conventional aperture integration techniques to evaluate the patterns of the corrugated horn. In general, the near axisE-plane radiation pattern of a pyramidal corrugated horn may be adequately predicted from standard analysis established for theH-plane patterns of conventional horn geometries [3]. This method, however, fails to predict the far-out sidelobe and backlobe radiation levels. The work presented here uses a knowledge of the aperture fields to predict the pattern using aperture integration and diffraction theory. The assumptions made concerning the aperture fields were verified by probing the internal fields and aperture fields of anXband corrugated horn. The results of this field probing are contained in the Appendix. The method of solution used in this paper parallels that used in previous publications [10]-[12]. Specifically, the pattern in the main beam region is computed using conventional aperture integration procedures, the contribution of theH-plane edges is found using a slope diffraction analysis, and the contribution of theE-plane edges is found by use of duality."
"A design method previously developed to give a sum pattern with arbitrary sidelobe topography is shown to be applicable to difference patterns as well. The basis is Bayliss patterns (Taylor-type patterns for the difference mode) which are transformed through an iterative procedure to the desired result. For practical cases the convergence is rapid and a previously developed do-loop computer program has been modified to facilitate the computations and provide final patterns and aperture distributions."
"A wire antenna moment method using piecewise sinusoidal expansion and testing functions is used to obtain properties of a symmetric center-fedV-dipole antenna driven by a slice generator. The impedance, admittance, current distribution, radiation patterns in the dipole plane, and other properties are computed as functions of the parameters0 < h/\\lambda \\leq 0.60,100 \\leq h/a \\leq 20 000, and30\\deg \\leq \\psi \\leq 180\\deg, whereh= arm length,\\lambda= free space wavelength,a= wire radius, and\\psi= apex angle. The results are checked with experiment and compared with similar results previously reported for the linear dipole. It is shown that 1) omnidirectional patterns over a wide bandwidth are achieved for\\psi \\leq 90\\deg, but at the expense of reduced resonant radiation resistance and reduced bandwidth, insofar as the impedance is concerned, 2) for\\psiless than about75\\deg-80\\deg, lowest resonant length\\geq \\lambda/4and increases ash/adecreases, and 3) lowest antiresonant length for\\psi > 30\\degis within0.01\\lambdaof that for a linear dipole with the sameh/a."
"The optimum directivity of antennas consisting of arbitrarily oriented dipoles is examined. This is done with the help of formulas found by the Gram-Schmit method of orthonormalization of the base, which includes the intensity of the electric field. Some examples follow."
"A new approach to synthetic image generation of radar targets from electromagnetic scattering measurements is described and illustrated. Complex harmonic samples of the backscattered response at ten frequencies lying in the low resonance range of the target response spectrum are used as input data for this approach. A periodic ramp response waveform synthesized from these data is shown to be correlated to the cross-sectional area versus distance along the line-of-sight, or profile function, of the targets measured. A technique using profile function data at three orthogonal target look angles for the mathematical specification of a three-dimensional \"approximate limiting surface\" is described. Visual images simulating an isometric view of the surface are then constructed. Images produced from model measurements of several target shapes are presented to illustrate some characteristics of this imaging process."
"A two-variable expansion technique is used to solve for the mean Green's function from the Dyson equation under the nonlinear approximation. The Bethe-Salpeter equation then gives rise to a set of modified radiative transfer (MRT) equations which accommodate coherent effects essential to bounded media. It is found that the nonlinear approximation, instead of the more popular bilocal approximation, should be used for the case of bounded media. The two approximations yield identical results for unbounded media. The MRT equations are then solved for a two-layer random medium. The MRT equations give rise to simple and useful solutions which are applicable to both active and passive microwave remote sensing."
"The input admittance of the rectangular cavity-backed slot antenna is investigated. The slot is assumed narrow so that the voltage distribution in its aperture is sinusoidal. Equations which represent the input admittance of this slot, backed by a rectangular cavity in which a single propagating wave is assumed to exist, are given. Calculations based on these representations are compared to available measured data. As the depth of the cavity increased the resonant frequency decreased and the bandwidth became narrower. Input admittance curves as a function of electrical slot length are also presented for several size cavities."
"Electromagnetic scattering due to a spherical conductor in presence of a slightly conducting dielectric cover has been studied. Numerical results have been presented for a three-layer model, excited by a uniform time harmonic magnetic field, where the intermediate layer accounts for the spacing between the core and the shield. Scattering coefficients for the covered and uncovered situations are compared in terms of an insertion loss parameter. The resulting curves provide information about the interesting frequency bands of supertransmission of energy between the source and the core-conductor. The results may find application in electromagnetic probing of some terrestrial and lunar situations."
"A special form of complex matrix called a \"phase-difference matrix\" that arises in the optimization of antenna arrays is discussed. It is shown that the inverse of such a matrix can be obtained by inverting an associated real matrix without having to perform any arithmetic operations with complex numbers."
"An example of SAR imagery of the ocean surface including the Gulf Stream Boundary reported by Moskowitz [1] is used to discuss potential mechanisms of SAR image formation of the ocean. It is pointed out that images in addition to those due to modulation of surface scatterer strength may result from organized scatterer motions such as those due to currents or wave orbital velocities. The modulation of scattering cross section by large waves is expected to depend on the magnitude and direction of the wind, making the relationship between image strengths and wave amplitudes rather complicated. It is suggested that the effect of wave orbital accelerations upon azimuthal focus might provide a more direct measure of wave amplitude."
"The radar backscatter coefficient\\sigma\\degof alfalfa was investigated as a function of both radar parameters and the physical characteristics of the alfalfa canopy. Measurements were acquired with an 8-18 GHz FM-CW mobile radar over an angular range of0\\deg-70\\degas measured from nadir. The experimental data indicate that the excursions of\\sigma\\degat nadir cover a range of nearly 18 dB during one complete growing cycle. An empirical model for\\sigma\\degwas developed, which accounts for its variability in terms of soil moisture, plant moisture, and plant height."
"For wideband communication systems, the differential group delay time may be a critical parameter. Dipole type elements are frequently used in arrays at the low end of the microwave band; the group delay of a dipole is calculated for frequencies in the vicinity of a half wavelength. The calculation is based on the zero order impedance and a formula developed previously for computer use."
"A microwave holographic technique for the determination of amplitude and phase of the principal and cross-polarized aperture fields of large reflector antennas is described. The hologram formation process utilizes the elevation over azimuth scanning system normally associated with these antennas, and, in this respect, appears to be unique among other proposed methods of field probing. The present work describes the means used to obtain vital information on the antenna structure such asE- andH-plane phase centers of the feed, and rms values of the reflector surface profile errors. Accurate prediction ofE- andH-plane radiation patterns in the near- and far-field is also demonstrated."
"A simple formula is derived for the current induced in an insulated conducting cylinder when embedded in an isotropic homogeneous dissipative medium and excited by a periodic electric field with uniform amplitude and phase along its axis. The currents on electrically short, resonant, and terminated insulated conductors are discussed."
 "The effects of random phase errors introduced by way of a composite material radome on the sidelobes of a low-sidelobe transmitting antenna are investigated. The nominal sidelobe level of interest is - 40 dB below maximum directive gain outside a minimum conical angle about boresight. The radome used was constructed using strips of fiberglass cloth pre-impregnated with epoxy resin with each strip overlapping adjacent strips. The overlapping is staggered so that the final thickness contains roughtly the same number of layers. The shape of the radome is cylindrical on the side, capped by a hemispherical sector. The radome curvature is large with respect to wavelength, and is several wavelengths thick atK_{a}band (37 GHz). Measurements made on the radiation patterns of a large aperture low-sidelobe lens antenna enclosed by the radome indicate that the sidelobe degradation introduced by the radome can be directly related to the construction technique and materials used. Subsequent measurements on the insertion phase versus position on the radome support these conclusions. In particular, the correlation length of the random insertion phase introduced upon transmission through the radome was determined to be essentially that of the overlapping width used in the fiberglass layup. Furthermore, periodicities in insertion phase having the basic period of the overlap width cause grating lobes to occur in the radiation pattern, further degrading the sidelobes."
"A new reflecting surface that re-orients a line-source through an angle of90\\degis discussed. Several curves on the surface are simple parabolas and ellipses, but the expression for an arbitrary curve on the surface is a fourth-order equation. The curves are derived by preserving phase relationship between the line source and the rotated line using geometrical optics. The intensity distribution on the rotated line is found by numerical integration."
"Precipitation has become a serious source of attenuation as higher frequencies are being employed for microwave communications. System performance is strongly influenced by the quantity and character of precipitation that occurs over the links of the system. Rain appears to be the precipitation form that accounts for most of the serious attenuation occurrences. It is also for rain that the Scattering theory is most complete. Rain attenuation can be accurately predicted if the drop-size distribution along the propagation path is known. The drop spectrum determines as well the rainfall rate, radar reflectivity, and microwave emission of rain. Consequently, it is possible to make estimates of rain attenuation through indirect measurements by raingauge, radar, and radiometer. Recent experiments have confirmed that these estimates are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. From propagation experiments and studies of the fine-scale structure of rain, data are becoming available on the horizontal extent of heavy rain areas and the way this structure influences system performance. These data have been used to formulate statistical raincell models that permit prediction of the performance of single-path and path-diversity systems. The current status of raincell models is reviewed and suggestions for future research are offered."

"The computation of radiation and scattering of electromagnetic fields by electrically large convex conducting cylinders, using the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) is considered. A general computer program has been developed for the transverse electric case. Illustrative computations are made for examples of radiation from a line source of magnetic current in the vicinity of a polygonal cylinder, scattering of plane waves, radiation from slots, and radiation from electric dipoles. Also given are examples of computations for conducting strips, grazing incidence on polygonal cylinders, and scattering from small cylinders. The computational accuracy is checked by comparing the results to corresponding ones computed by a moment solution to theH-field integral equation."
 "Observations of the differential propagation constant in snow are reported. These observations, made with circularly-polarized radars, indicate that the principal effect of anisotropy is to produce a differential phase shift. A value of0.36\\degper kilometer has been obtained for propagation through snow at a wavelength of 10.4 cm; at 1.8 cm values ranging from0.16\\degto1.17\\degper kilometer were observed in moderate to heavy snow."
"A one-parameter circular aperture distribution is developed which provides an optimum compromise between narrow beamwidth, low sidelobes, and low apertureQ. The pattern is a modifiedJ_{1}(x)/x, analogous to the Taylor one-parameter modified sin(x)/xline source distribution. Sidelobe envelope taper is essentially that of a uniformly excited circular aperture; hence the aperture is lowQ. The aperture distribution which is rotationally symmetric is given by a modified Bessel function of zero order. Like all high efficiency distributions, it has a pedestal. All antenna quantities, sidelobe ratio, beamwidth, aperture efficiency, and edge taper, are uniquely related to the parameterH. A table of these quantities is given for sidelobe ratios up to 50 dB. A typical pattern and several distributions are graphed. This new distribution allows tradeoff studies to be made against any design quantity, with all other quantities determined through the one-parameter."
"This paper deals with considerations in the design of an electronically steered IFF antenna which is to provide sidelobe suppression through the use of a difference beam with gain higher than that of the sum beam everywhere outside of the mainlobe region. The influence of the suppression requirement upon illumination design tradeoffs in beamwidth, sidelobe levels, and taper efficiency is demonstrated theoretically for an array restricted to 16 elements. The sidelobe suppression performance for this array, with appropriate choices for amplitude taper, number of phase shifter bits and randomizing phase function, is examined in detail for susceptibility to failures in elements, failures in individual phase shifter bits, and random phase and amplitude illumination errors. In the case of random errors, performance variability with steering direction is examined and a criterion involving the radiation patterns at both the transmit and receive RF frequencies is defined as a measure of performance. It is seen that the design analyzed is successful in reducing the corresponding performance degradation to very low levels in even the worst cases. Expressions are presented for estimating the effects of increasing the number of elements upon improvements in performance in the presence of component failures or random errors."
"This paper presents the formulas relating feed polarization to aperture plane polarization, shows that the cross polarization in reflector antennas is closely related to the feed design, gives the ideal feed polarizations yielding zero aperture cross-polarized fields, and also puts an end to the controversy recently arisen about the relative susceptibility of Cassegrainian and front-fed antennas to depolarization effects."
 "Antenna patterns can be synthesized using a new nonlinear minimax optimization method with sure convergence properties. Not requiring derivatives, the proposed method is general and easy to use so that it might be applied to a wide variety of nonlinear synthesis problems for which analytical solutions are not known. To test the algorithm a group of test problems for which exact analytical solutions are known has been considered, namely, optimization of Dolph-Chebyshev arrays by spacing variation. The method is further applied to find the element positions in nonuniformly spaced linear arrays with uniform excitation that produce minimized (equal) sidelobe levels, and comparisons are made with conventional Dolph-Chebyshev arrays."
 "An extension of the principles of multimode phased array waveguide simulators to triangular spaced array antennas is presented. It is also shown how such a simulator can be used for any polarization of excitation, if the radiating elements are circular symmetric. Contour plots of the reflection and the transmission coefficients are shown for circular polarization of excitation. The radiating elements are open-ended circular waveguides in a triangular lattice. A comparison between the simulator technique and the small test array technique to approximate the infinite array performance is also given."
"An integral equation is used to numerically study microwave surface wave antennas. The source is chosen as a horizontal magnetic line current which is placed parallel to a planar surface having a one-dimensional nonuniform surface reactance. The integral equation is numerically solved exactly taking full account of radiation from both the feed and the termination, and their mutual interaction. By varying the profile of the surface reactance and the antenna length, radiation characteristics such as directivity, beam width and sidelobe level are discussed. The optimum excess phase delay is found to be about\\pi/3for an antenna length of3\\lambda_{0}, gradually increasing to\\pi/2for a length of8\\lambda_{0}. When a feed transition in the reactance profile is used to achieve a good surface wave launching efficiency near the source, the first sidelobe can be reduced to less than-10 dB below the main beam level with little effect upon the directivity. Optimum reactance profiles are suggested for antennas from3\\lambda_{0}to8\\lambda_{0}long."
"The plane wave spectrum (PWS) method has previously been applied to analyze the near-field of planar apertures. The main goal of this paper is to present new PWS formulations for the near-fields of strip and circular apertures. Only special cases are developed in detail. For example, the uniform and parabolic aperture distributions are developed for the circular aperture. These new formulations are expressed in terms of either elementary functions or Fresnel integrals. Consequently, they permit considerably more rapid and efficient calculations than previous near-field formulations, by either the PWS or the aperture integration approach. The new formulations are especially advantageous for large circularly symmetric apertures (on the order of100\\lambdaand larger) in that computational efficiencies are improved by an order of magnitude or two over the original PWS formulation. The improvement over aperture integration techniques is more than a factor of 1000 for the100\\lambdaaperture."
"Integro-differential equations are formulated for the general problem of a finite-length wire excited through an arbitrarily shaped aperture in a conducting screen. The wire is assumed to be electrically thin and perfectly conducting, and it is arbitrarily oriented behind the perfectly conducting screen of infinite extent. A known, specified incident field illuminates the perforated-screen/wire structure. The integro-differential equations fully account for the coupling between the wire and the aperture/screen. They are specialized to the case of the wire parallel to the screen with the aperture a narrow slot of general length. These special equations are solved numerically and data are presented for wire currents and aperture fields under selected conditions of wire/slot lengths and orientation. Data indicative of the coupling between the wire and slot are presented."
"A user-oriented computer program has been developed for high frequency radiation and scattering from infinitely-long perfectly. conducting convex cylinders. The analysis is based on the self-consistent geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). The cylinder is modeled as anN-sided polygon. Two cylindrical waves with unknown amplitudes are assumed to travel in opposite directions on each face of the polygon. The boundary conditions for the corners are applied to set up a matrix equation for2Nunknowns (the amplitudes associated with the traveling cylindrical waves). Crout's method is used to solve the matrix equation. Once the amplitudes for the traveling waves are determined, the radiation or scattered field is readily obtained via the usual GTD techniques. Numerical results are presented for radiation and scattering from rectangular, semi-circular, circular, and elliptic cylinders for both principal polarizations. The results show excellent agreement with GTD, moment, and eigenfunction solutions."
"Electrically small (reduced size) antennas are inherently narrow-band or inefficient, or both. A summary is presented of prior work on complementary pair antennas and the use of the coupling between the two elements to optimize the impedance match and efficiency of such structures. The design of electrically small complementary pairs is described, and preliminary measurement results are shown for monopoles. These measurements indicate a substantial improvement in gain-bandwidth product as compared to conventional matching techniques for electrically small antennas. The power delivered to the external region is analyzed for both an individual monopole, and a pair of monopoles, by establishing the scattering matrices for both cases. The potential gain is calculated for the pair over the individual monopole, and it is shown that the pair can deliver up to twice the power to the exterior region if the mutual impedance term is optimized. In addition, the complementarization circuit in conjunction with the hybrid feed can reduce the effects of mutual impedances in steerable-beam arrays. Various special cases are discussed, varying from full complementarity to zero complementarity, and general conclusions are presented on the optimization of gain-bandwidth product. Applications include small individual antennas and scatterers as well as linear, planar, or circular arrays in a variety of fixed-station or vehicular uses."
"Equations for the co-polar and cross-polar fields in the focal plane of paraboloidal reflectors when excited by a plane wave are derived for linear and circular polarization, it is shown that for linear polarization the co-polar diffraction image consists of an elliptically shaped bright region followed by dark and bright zones. On the other hand, the cross-polar image consists essentially of four bright spots separated by a dark cross. These theoretical findings were confirmed by measurements. With circular polarization the co-polar diffraction image comprises a bright central circle followed by dark and bright rings, whereas the cross-polar image consists of a dark central circle followed by bright and dark rings. It is also shown that the field distribution in the image space is affected to a great extent by the angular semiaperture\\psi'. Graphs of the variation of the image characteristics with\\psiare also given."
"A new scheme has been developed to measure the plasma density directly with the use of a short antenna driven by a sweeping frequency RF source and biased by a variable negative dc voltage."
"Geometric optics and diffraction techniques are used to develop radiation models of antennas mounted on an aircraft structure. Measurements at 35 GHz on a 1/35 scale model space shuttle and 1/11 scale Boeing 737 are used for comparison with computed patterns and are in very good agreement. Radiation coverage in the elevation plane on full scale Boeing 737 and Boeing 747 at 5.1 GHz, as applied to the microwave landing system (MLS), is examined for vertically- and horizontally-polarized antennas mounted at different locations on the aircraft."
"The existence of asymmetric resonant modes on standard log-periodic dipole antennas is established experimentally. These modes are characterized by sharply-resonant side radiation sometimes accompanied by reduction in front-lobe gain. The resonances occur at frequencies whose relationship is approximately log-periodic. In a single antenna the resonant modes are excited by any structural asymmetry, while in anE-plane array each individual antenna excites the others asymmetrically. The resonances can be eliminated by the addition of lossy material to appropriate parts of the antenna. Qualitatively the phenomenon is explained in terms of transmission-line resonances along the two-wire lines formed by adjacent dipoles. Automated swept-frequency far-field measurement techniques were employed throughout, and their worth is clearly established for broadband antenna research and development."
"Full wave solutions for the electromagnetic fields of a horizontally polarized wave propagating through an inhomogeneous ionized medium are derived using a generalized WKB method. Both the electron density and the collision frequency of the horizontally stratified media are assumed to vary and special attention is given to permittivity profiles with critical coupling regions. The reflection and transmission coefficients and the characteristic surface impedance for an inhomogeneous layer of finite thickness are computed as functions of the transverse wave number for various permittivity profiles. Excitation of both propagating and evanescent waves are considered. For some special permittivity profiles considered, closed form analytical solutions for the electromagnetic fields are known. Computations derived from these solutions are in good agreement with those obtained using the generalized WKB method. The results are also shown to satisfy energy conservation and reciprocity relationships in electromagnetic theory."
"The ray tracing technique in absorbing, isotropic or anisotropic stratified media, and particularly in plane-stratified media is discussed. There are two approaches. One is to construct the complex refractive index vector and use the principle of stationary phase. The other is to impose a spatial beam signal on the medium having, e.g., a Gaussian profile and to find the peak of a component of the field intensity at each stratified layer. In this paper, we deal with the second approach. The resulting analytical expression for ray tracing is found to be identical with that obtained via the first method."
"Calculations are presented for the variance and bias of three related angle estimators caused by propagation through a layer containing random index of refraction fluctuations. The usual amplitude and phase sum-and-difference techniques, as well as a third amplitude comparison technique are considered. One-dimensional integral expressions for the variance and bias are given for Gaussian antenna patterns, isotropic turbulence, and targets near the antenna boresights. Results show that for the same total aperture the variances of amplitude and phase comparison monopulse radars are equal for arbitrary turbulence spectrum. The biases for the amplitude and phase sum-and-difference estimators are related by a constant multiplying factor while the bias for the amplitude comparison estimator is generally larger than the bias of the amplitude sum-and-difference estimator."
"A multiple-beam sampler is described for continuously scanned array antennas using frequency modulation or time modulation for the scanning process. It is shown that for the special case of a linear array antenna with a number of receiving elements equal to an integer power of two, the multiple-beam sampler can be implemented using a minimum number of phase shifters and adders. The scheme makes use of the similarity of the expressions defining the discretized version of the beam sampling signal and the discrete Fourier transform. Extension of the multiple-beam sampler to planar array antennas is also considered."
"A nonsidelobe unidirectional endfire array (NUEA) is described. As is well known, there are two kinds of such an array, a 2-elemeat uniform array and a binomial array. The array spacing is usually restricted to\\lambda/4, but there is no need to only restrict to such a spacing for NUEA. From a general formula of a uniform endfire array ofnelements, the unidirectional condition and the nonsidelobe unidirectional condition are obtained. For the uniform NUEA, the array spacing is\\lambda/2n; and this array is extended to a polynomial array, of which the array spacing is similarly\\lambda/2n. These array patterns are monotonically decreasing with a zenithal angle refering to the forward axis."
"Two approximate methods for analyzing the electrically small circular-loop antenna in a dissipative medium have been presented in the literature. Admittances calculated by these methods are compared with the twenty-term Fourier series results which are known to be in good agreement with experimental data. The conductance predicted by both methods is in poor agreement with the Fourier series results. The reason for this difference is determined and a simple, accurate formula obtained for the admittance. The far-zone electric field maintained by the current on the loop is determined, and the accuracy of assuming a uniform current on the loop for field calculations is discussed."
"The problem of synthesizing a reflector surface to produce a two-variable generalized far-field pattern under the geometrical optics approximation can, under certain conditions, be formulated as an initial-value problem. The problem involves solving a set of four simultaneous quasi-linear first-order partial differential equations which can be handled using standard numerical techniques."
"The problem of finding the transient response of a cold plasma half space to an impulsive plane wave at vertical incidence is considered. The electron density of the plasma is allowed to vary arbitrarily with the vertical coordinate; and the effects of a vertical magnetic field and losses are included in the analysis. The impulse response is formulated in terms of a time-dependent integral equation by extending previous results obtained via a multiple-scattering technique. As an example of this method numerical results are presented for the special case of reflection from a linear plasma half space."
"The pattern deterioration that occurs at high scanning speeds in frequency-scanned arrays is studied. Four major effects are observed; these are 1) fall in main beam amplitude, 2) rise in sidelobe level, 3) angular shift in the location of the main beam, and 4) widening of the main beam. A theoretical limit on scanning rates is established beyond which pattern distortion becomes excessive. The results are illustrated by a numerical example."
"Theoretical calculations of the amplitude and phase of the horizontally polarized backscatter from a small right circular cone in the region near base-on are presented. Predictions are performed using both the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) and the physical theory of diffraction (PTD) and are compared to experimental phase and amplitude data obtained on the Georgia Tech compact radar cross-section range. Discrepancies between prediction and experiment are noted and it is shown that analysis of the phase of the backscatter can provide a clue to the understanding of these discrepancies and can be used to determine the location of scattering centers whose presence may not be apparent in amplitude data. Based on this analysis, the initial GTD formulation is modified by the inclusion of a tip scattering term and the resulting prediction is shown to agree well with experiment."
  "The reflection and transmission characteristics of an arbitrary, periodic interface characterized by either a surface admittance function or surface impedance function are presented. Two dual formulations are presented and the convergence properties of each are studied in detail. As contrasted to most techniques employing moment methods, the matrix elements of the resulting admittance or impedance matrix used in the computation are computed from simple analytical expressions. We show that the convergence properties of each formulation are highly sensitive to incident polarization. Furthermore, the technique applied in most cases of practical interest yields a rapidly converging solution for the reflected or transmitted field. Peculiar resonances associated with certain periodic structures are examined in detail. For example it is shown that the use of a dielectric mounting structure for a metal-free-space grating can significantly alter the transmission characteristics of the grating."

 "The direct simulation of external noise fields containing a large number of discrete noise sources or interference that is continuously distributed in angle requires the generation of a large number of independent random variables per sample of array input. A method of simulating exactly the statistics of an arbitrary Gaussian noise field at the input to anN-element array with onlyNrandom variables is described."
"The optimum adaptive steering of multibeam antennas is discussed, where a single beam is scanned or shaped by weighting and summing the antenna outputs. Classical principles and implementations are valid here. The most effective antenna system involves a set of orthogonal beams by means of which gain maximization, pattern synthesis, beam scanning, besides pattern null steering can be realized. A large weight dynamic range may be required for low sidelobe synthesis. A number of antennas fitting the desired type is cited. The feasibility of real weight instead of complex weight control is illustrated by means of a linear array fed by a Butler matrix."
"In a conventional array, the location of each element must be known to an accuracy of about\\lambda/10for phasing and scanning purposes. A larger tolerance on the element location results in the loss of gain and deterioration of the radiation pattern. In a self-cohering phased array, the phasing of the array elements is accomplished closed-loop and adaptively; therefore, no information on the element location is necessary. On the other hand, to scan the adaptively formed beam about the direction of the received wave, which has to be performed open-loop, one requires information on the element locations. In this paper, basic relations pertaining to the open-loop scanning of adaptive antenna arrays of arbitrary geometry are derived for both far-field and near-field scanning problems, and the transition between the two cases and the required accuracy in the knowledge of the same distance are explored. It is shown that the tolerance requirement on the element locations is the conventional tolerance divided by the maximum scan angle. In large systems designed for target imaging, it is shown that the tolerance on element location can be two or more orders of magnitude larger than that in a conventional array."
"The experimental pattern behavior of a four-element adaptive array based on a steepest-descent feedback algorithm is described. The array uses four multiturn loop elements on an aircraft fuselage mock-up. Operational patterns have been measured as a function of various parameters: frequency, element placement, desired signal and interference angles of arrival, signal powers, etc. Typical patterns are presented and the performance characteristics of the array are described."
"This paper recounts the invention and development of adaptive processing at General Electric and the Syracuse University Research Corporation, giving heuristic explanations of the behavior of adaptive systems and discussing the relation between fixed and adaptive resolution."
"Suboptimal suppression of directional noise before beam forming is possible by a random choice and attachment of partner elements for the respective estimation and elimination of the noise in each sensor channel of an array. Beam switching can take place independently of an adaptation against the directional noise. The adjustment of the weighting for the partner elements may be performed by stochastic approximation or analog control loops."
"By using very lightweight hybrid microwave integrated circuitry, the size and weight of an analog, correlation-controlled, null-steering array atCband has been greatly reduced, to the order of 1 lb for a four-element array. The key components, the adaptive weights, and correlation control circuitry, have been demonstrated in miniaturized form, with a null depth of 25-30 dB attained over a 60-100 MHz bandwidth."
"A simplified adaptive receiving antenna array is considered for which the element signal phases are adjustable but the amplitudes are not. An algorithm for determining the phase adjustments necessary to bring the signals into coincidence is presented. For an array ofN + 1elements, the algorithm requires that the power at the summed output of the array be measured for6N + 2test adjustments of the phase shifter array."
"Voltage-controlled phase shifters are used as the adjustable elements in an adaptive phased-array antenna system for spatial filtering of narrow-band inputs. A gradient-search adaptation algorithm for adjusting phase angle is developed and applied to an adaptive antenna system which can be adapted either to enhance signals or reject interference. The transient behavior of this system during adaptation is analyzed in terms of steepest ascent/descent on a multidimensional trigonometric performance surface approximated in two regions by quadratic surfaces."
"Design synthesis and analysis procedures for nonadaptive antennas as well as for the adaptive type are highly developed and continuously being improved. For the adaptive antennas, range and field testing are still essential but are more complicated because of the larger number of significant variables. A suggested configuration for a bench-type compact signal generator-simulator for the development and test of adaptive (as well as nonadaptive) array antennas is shown."
"Adaptive preprocessing networks placed ahead of the main adaption circuits of an adaptive antenna can be arranged to resolve the input signals into their eigenvector components. As such, they have the capability of materially improving the convergence rates in certain cases. This is true even when the solution for the eigenvector components is only approximate. Although the preprocessor involves additional hardware, the demands on the main processor are eased, and in some cases, we may dispense with the main processor."
"Most studies and experimental work in the past on the subject of adaptive arrays have been concerned with systems with, at most, a few tens of adaptive elements. In the study of the problems facing the next generation of ballistic missile defense radars, it has become clear that jamming poses a very serious threat. These radar systems typically contain as many as 3000 to 5000 elements per array face. The adaptive array technique is a likely candidate to aid in countering this threat. This paper examines the problem of configuring such a large array to provide partial adaptivity. A method of analysis is presented and the results of simulations and analysis are presented showing the effects of configuration, the effects of practical component tolerances, and the transient response characteristics of several candidate systems."
"Experimental results relating to the use of time-domain, continuously adapting beamformers in an HF bistatic FM/CW backscatter radar system are presented. Data for the study were obtained using the Wide Aperture HF Radio Research Facility (WARF) which is located in the central valley of California and is operated by Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, CA. Eastward-looking transmissions were employed with an operating frequency chosen so as to provide single-hop ionospheric propagation on both the forward and backscatter paths. Digital real-time recordings were taken at eight received subarray outputs. These recordings were then processed off-line using a large general purpose computer. The beamforming methods studied, however, are computationally simple and may be readily implemented in real-time using a commercially available minicomputer. Two adaptive algorithms were studied and in both cases it was shown that signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 10 to 15 dB are readily achieved when adaptive beamforming is compared with conventional, Dolph taper beamforming methods using identical received data in an HF backscatter environment. It was also demonstrated that the time scale of coefficient variation in an adaptive processor operating in this environment is the order of 1 s. Successful tracking of the adaptive algorithm under these conditions was demonstrated. The use of moving target indication (MTI) clutter suppression filters at the subarray outputs, prior to adaptation, was investigated. No significant improvement was observed with the use of these filters on experimental data. Finally, it was shown that the presence of fading nulls can significantly affect the determination of optimal subarray location and spacing in an HF environment. In general, the adaptive beamformer performance was found to be less dependent upon array geometry than was the case for conventional processing."
"An adaptive-array beamforming capability has been implemented on-line in an existing over-the-horizon (OTH) backscatter radar. Inputs to the beamformer consisted of signals from eight 32- element subarrays of the 256-element, 2.5-km-long receiving array at the Wide Aperture Research Facility (WARF) located in California. Both conventional and adaptive beamforming were performed prior to the usual range/Doppler analysis used to extract radar targets from noise and clutter. The GriffithsP-vector algorithm, a recursive, time-domain adaptive technique, was implemented in all-digital fashion using fixed-point arithmetic on a 16-bit minicomputer. Desired signals utilized were aircraft targets and a fixed, ground-based radar repeater simulating a moving target, while unwanted signals were other-user interference and signals from a separate ground-based radar repeater. It was found that adaptive rejection of unwanted signals was dependent on pointing-angle alignment and that rejection was often increased by removal of the clutter by moving target indicator (MTI) filtering prior to adaptation. For some conditions, Doppler broadening can he produced by the time modulation imposed by continuous adaptation, unwanted-signal rejection with the adaptive beamformer is variable, but side-by-side comparisons obtained at WARF show that adaptive beamforming can reject off-azimuth signals up to 20 dB better than conventional beamforming with a -25 dB Dolph taper."
"The concept of the adaptive system working on the principle of minimizing the output power under the constrained response to specified directions is introduced. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation experiments on this directional constraint system are also presented. By comparison with the computer experiment, the differential equation approach is shown to be useful to predict the behavior of the system. The effect of error in setting the constraint direction is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the system is not very sensitive to such error. This margin can be made even greater by adopting the double directional constraints system. This system is also analyzed theoretically and experimented by computer simulation. History of output power components during adaptation is shown, which enables the comprehension of the behavior of the system."
"The ability of an AMTI (airborn moving target indication) radar to reject clutter is often seriously degraded by the motion of the radar. An adaptive receiving array can compensate for platform motion and provide excellent AMTI performance. Scattering from aircraft structure can also distort antenna patterns and reduce AMTI capability. The technique described here can adapt the element weights to compensate for near-field scatterers and element excitation errors. Another important advantage is the ability to null out discrete active interference sources without significantly degrading AMTI performance."
"Adaptive array research at The Ohio State University is presented in a summary form. The main objective of the research was to assess the capabilities of adaptive arrays for communication systems in real environments. Consequently the theoretical work was often corroborated by experimental implementation and testing of proposed techniques. Specifically, three systems in which adaptive arrays were successfully incorporated are described, a single channel spread spectrum communication system, a TDMA satellite communication system, and a remote sensor communication system. Numerous other adaptive array studies are briefly summarized."
"This paper compares the performance characteristics of three algorithms useful in adjusting the parameters of adaptive systems: the differential (DSD) and least-mean-square (LMS) algorithms, both based on the method of steepest descent, and the linear random search (LRS) algorithm, based on a random search procedure derived from the Darwinian concept of \"natural selection.\" The LRS algorithm is presented here for the first time. Analytical expressions are developed that define the relationship between rate of adaptation and \"misadjustment,\" a dimensionless measure of the difference between actual and optimal performance due to noise in the adaptive process. For a fixed rate of adaptation it is shown that the LMS algorithm, which is the most efficient, has a misadjustment proportional to the number of adaptive parameters, while the DSD and LRS algorithms have misadjustments proportional to the square of the number of adaptive parameters. The expressions developed are verified by computer simulations that demonstrate the application of the three algorithms to system modeling problems, of the LMS algorithm to the cancelling of broadband interference in the sidelobes of a receiving antenna array, and of the DSD and LRS algorithms to the phase control of a transmitting antenna array. The second application introduces a new method of constrained adaptive beamforming whose performance is not significantly affected by element nonuniformity. The third application represents a class of problems to which the LMS algorithm in the basic form described in this paper is not applicable."
"Adaptive null-steering arrays which use phase-only weights are examined. The optimal phase weightings are developed and the mathematical equations are reduced to a simplified computational form. Approximations for low sidelobe arrays allow more efficient computations and demonstrate the decomposition of the antenna pattern into a sum of patterns which place gain towards each directional emitter. Computer simulations and breadboard array measurements substantiate the mathematical development and indicate the practicality of the method."
"Initial applications of adaptive array theory to the radar sidelobe jamming problem ignored the problem of incidental cancellation of the desired signal returns. In more recent applications, longer transmitted waveforms have combined with returns from extended clutter and/or strong targets to create a more serious signal cancellation problem. There are several ways in which the adaptive processor can be constrained from responding to desired main lobe target returns while maintaining good cancellation of interference in the sidelobes. This paper examines the major techniques for constraining the response of the adaptive processor, including methods of controlling the response of the array in the absence of external interference. Time domain and frequency domain techniques are discussed. The majority of the discussion is devoted to angle domain techniques such as pilot signals, preadaption spacial filtering, and control loop spatial filtering. Analysis is presented showing the relationship between these techniques. Finally, examples are given showing the effects of these constraints as well as control of the quiescent array pattern."
"A method for adaptively optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of an array antenna is presented. Optimum element weights are derived for a prescribed environment and a given signal direction. The derivation is extended to the optimization of a \"generalized\" signal-to-noise ratio which permits specification of preferred weights for the normal quiescent environment. The relation of the adaptive array to sidelobe cancellation is shown, and a real-time adaptive implementation is discussed. For illustration, the performance of an adaptive linear array is presented for various jammer configurations."

"A general formulation for aperture problems is given in terms of the method of moments. It applies to any two regions isolated except for coupling through the aperture. The aperture characteristics are expressed in terms of two aperture admittance matrices, one for each region. The admittance matrix for one region is independent of the other region, and hence can be used for any problem involving that region and aperture. The solution can be represented by two generalizedn-port networks connected in parallel with current sources. The current sources are related to the tangential magnetic field which exists over the aperture region when the aperture is closed by an electric conductor. Formulas for fields (linear functionals) and power (quadratic functionals) are given in terms of the admittance matrices."
"The theory and performance of a quasi-optical Fabry-Perot diplexer employing two rectangular meshes and capable of polarization-independent operation at large angles of incidence are presented. The diplexer is suitable for use in a dual-polarization dual-frequency beam feed system for millimeter-wave antennas. An experimental diplexer operating at an angle of incidence of56.5\\deg \\pm 1\\degwas found to separate two 1.1-GHz bands centered at 21 and 31.5 GHz with a loss of less than 0.3 dB in either band and a cross-polarization discrimination of more than 40 dB in the higher band and 30 dB in the lower band."
"A new theory is developed to describe the operation of a radio telescope consisting of an array of two-element interferometers. The theory is based on recent developments in the theory of partial coherence, which employs an expansion of the scalar field amplitude into an angular spectrum of plane waves. Expressions are found describing the correlation of the field amplitudes in the antenna plane which are more general than usually obtained, and which suggest a simplified data processing procedure which might yield improved images. The usual quasi-monochromatic approximation is made and the conditions under which it is valid are discussed in detail. Finally the theory is connected with the usual procedure for producing images of the radio sources and the existence of an obliquity factor is shown which could affect images over a large field of view."
"During the summer of 1974 and spring of 1975, measurements of attenuation of propagation through rain were made at Wallops Island, VA, using 13 and 18 GHz transmitters operating in the uplink mode toward the ATS-6 satellite. Simultaneously, rain reflectivity levels were measured along the earth-satellite path using a high resolution (0.4\\degbeamwidth)S-band radar having a scanning antenna. Four raingages and two disdrometers were also located in the vicinity of the transmitters. The radar and disdrometer data were used in a modeling program to predict attentuation levels which were subsequently compared to the directly measured fades over nearly simultaneous time intervals. Predicted attentuation levels were obtained for three drop size distributions; namely, those of Joss et al. for thunderstorm activity, Marshall-Palmer, and the average distribution measured in the vicinity of the transmitter (APL distribution). Comparisons between predicted and measured attenuation levels showed the APL dropsize distribution gave the smallest rms difference of 1.3 dB at 13 and 18 GHz although the rms difference corresponding to Marshall-Palmer was close to this value. Although the sample sizes were relatively small, the good agreement suggests the validity of using radar to model path attenuation to obtain attenuation statistics."
"A technique is described for the synthesis of line source antennas. This technique provides arbitrary control of individual extrema of the radiation pattern. It may be used to apply independent specifications to individual sidelobes or to specify certain types of shaped beam patterns. Independent control is also provided for the asymptotic behavior of the more remote sidelobes."
"Imaging through random aberrating media can be of interest not only in optics but also in microwaves or in acoustics. However, the holographic techniques applied in optics cannot be readily extended to microwaves without essential modifications. A different holographic method is here proposed which seems convenient at microwaves. The image is obtained by the product of the aberrated hologram with another compensating for the aberration. In the experiments two different procedures have been followed to perform the product of the two holograms, the optical and the electronic multiplication. The results obtained with the two procedures are shown, one of which allows the correction of time variant aberrations. With this technique there is no limitation in the off-set angles of the reference waves that could be also obtained by locally produced signals and no coherence is requested between the object and the compensating wave. The technique could be of interest, for instance, in plasma diagnostic and geophysical problems."
"Synthesis of antenna arrays employing theL_{2}-norm as well as theL_{\\infty}-norm is discussed. The approximation in theL_{\\infty}-norm is obtained making use of Lawson's algorithm. A general iterative perturbation technique has been evolved for pattern synthesis for the case when the antenna currents alone are varied as web as for the case when both the antenna currents and the element positions are simultaneously varied. A few illustrative examples are given. The convergence of the iteration and the uniqueness of the solution are discussed."
"A mathematical method for the reconstruction of the electron density profileN(x)for an inhomogeneous, stratified, simple plasma is presented. If the reflection coefficientr(k)of the incident probing electromagnetic wave is approximated by a third-order rational approximation, then profiles can be obtained which are similar to profiles obtained from simulated VHF satellite tracking data. The method is based upon the solution of the fundamental integral equation of inverse scattering (Gelfand-Levitan) theory. Using this theory it is possible to obtain an analytical expression forN(x)as a function of distancexin the plasma ifr(k)is a rational function of the wave numberk. The integral equation is solved by the Laplace transform technique and checked by the differential operator technique. The method is exact once the functional form ofr(k)is determined. Thus this analysis can supplement information about profiles which are obtained from calculations based on the WKB approximation (which approximation can also be applied to calculate the local wave impedanceW(x)for propagation in nonuniform regions). The functional characteristics ofN(x)depend on the pole positions ofr(k)in the complexkplane. By calculating the variations inN(x)due to variations in these pole positions, it is possible to set a finite error bound on the profile of the electron density if the error bound in the rational approximation to the reflection coefficient is known."
"The use of a horizontal magnetic dipole in geophysical subsurface probing with the electromagnetic fringes method is investigated. It is found that when placed on the surface of a half-space medium, angles of maximum power coupling into the medium occur at\\sin^{-1} ((1 + n^{2})/2n^{2})^{1/2}in the endfire direction and\\sin^{-1} (1/n)in the broadside direction, wherenis the refractive index of the half-space medium. Also the broadside radiation pattern exhibits a sharper maximum as compared with that of a horizontal electric dipole, which provides a clearer indication of the depth of a subsurface layer."
"The long-term variability (i.e., greater than hundreds of seconds) of the transfer function for a radio link in the 55 to 65 GHz range is examined by computing the differential attenuation and differential phase with respect to changes in pressure and temperature. The computed values for the differential attenuation and phase for a 3 km path are on the order of 0.06 dB and 0.13 rad, respectively, for a 5 percent change in temperature and a 1 percent change in pressure. This indicates that in some applications an equalizer may not be necessary. The expected time variations in the transfer function are estimated from experimental measurements of atmospheric changes. The time variability of the transfer function shows a high degree of correlation with the time variability of the air density."
"An experimental investigation has been made of the possibility of using a microwave radiometer to find humans covered by snow. When a radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz was moved along a track it registered a highly fluctuating radiation temperature of the snow covered ground. The increase in temperature when the radiometer passed over a human was so small that detection in general was impossible."
"A variety of systems and platforms have been used over the past three decades to acquire radar backscatter data of terrain. The variability in the reported data was evaluated for agricultural crops under \"similar\" phenological conditions and for approximately the same sensor parameters (frequency, polarization, and angle of incidence). The evaluation reveals wide variations in the magnitude of the scattering coefficient among different measurement programs. While it is difficult to determine the exact causes of these variations it is quite evident that extreme care must be employed in 1) monitoring the measurement system transfer function, 2) calibrating the system on an absolute basis, and 3) acquiring and reporting detailed target parameter information."
"Diffraction of parallel polarized electromagnetic waves from corrugated periodic perfectly conducting surfaces is analyzed by both a rigorous method and a method based on the Rayleigh hypothesis. The accuracy of the rigorous technique is established by comparing results against other theoretical and experimental results. Further results are then obtained and used as standards against which results based on the Rayleigh method are compared for accuracy. These comparisons indicate that the Rayleigh method gives reasonably accurate results for gratings with surface height to period ratios of up to0.88/(2\\pi). This confirms that the Rayleigh method is also applicable to these nonanalytic surfaces and leads to accuracies that are higher than those normally assumed in the literature."
"Loop antennas with dimensions comparable to the wavelength are sometimes of practical interest. In order to use such antennas, design engineers would need simple formulas or data about the radiation resistance of such antennas. For the reason, that nothing else has been known, the radiation resistance has been calculated by means of a digital computer."
"This is a program suitable for analysis problems involving lossless parallel horizontal thin wires located over an imperfectly conducting horizontal ground plane. The program is equipped to treat arbitrarily spaced arrays of wires that can be of different lengths and radii. However, it is assumed the wires are all centerfed and unloaded"
"The International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) is that component of the Internatioanl Telecommunication Union which can have a significant impact upon the professional careers of members of the IEEE/AP and URSL This paper, a mini-review sponsored by the IEEE Wave Propagation Standards Committee, introduces the CCIR organization, and describes how its functions (particularly with respect to the two propagation Study Groups, SG 5 and 6) relate to U.S. engineers. It then looks into the preparation of material for the \"green books\" and the processes through which the updating of these books may be influenced by the U.S. telecommunications community."
 "The possibilities of connecting a lossless network between input ports and antenna ports such that there is no coupling and scattering between the antennas are discussed. A necessary condition for complete decoupling and descattering is power orthogonality between the patterns of the individual antennas. Numerical and experimental results are presented for monopole antennas."
"Broadbanding of corrugated conical horns is investigated with the ring-loaded corrugated circular waveguide (RCWG) structure devised by the authors. The useful frequency bandwidth in which the corrugated horn is effective for the improvement of antenna properties is limited by the frequency characteristics of the horn-aperture field and input VSWR of the horn. By the precise analysis of the RCWG, the maximum frequency range in which the desirable field is obtained is much wider than that in the conventional corrugated circular waveguide, and is achieved almost independent of ring thickness, when ring width is about 20 percent of slot depth. The characteristic impedance of the RCWG is nearly equal to that of the homogeneous circular waveguide when ring thickness becomes large. Therefore, a good transformer between the RCWG and the homogeneous circular waveguide is achieved by increasing ring thickness from the RCWG toward the homogeneous waveguide. From the above investigations, it is found that in the ring-loaded corrugated horn, the useful bandwidth is 1.35 times broader than that in the conventional corrugated horn. The theoretical results are verified by the experimental results."
"In this paper we briefly review the theories that are used to interpret ionospheric scintillation data. We have emphasized the full structure of the complex signal, because it is now being directly measured with a number of satellites that carry multifrequency phase-coherent beacons. The data that have been analyzed to date clearly show that large phase variations (greater than one radian) are an omnipresent feature of transionospheric signals."
"It is shown that there is an optimum nonzero value of mutual coupling and passive reflection coefficient that is a function of only the embedded element pattern and element spacing. Optimum is defined as yielding maximum array gain. For closely spaced arrays, the optimum mutual coupling and passive reflection coefficient are quite large, but tend to cancel in the active mode to produce a low active reflection coefficient. A smaller value of mutual coupling would give lower gain than the optimum case. This again demonstrates that mutual coupling is a natural and desirable effect in array behavior. It is well known that it is possible to achieve array superdirectivity, in the sense that the directivity of an array of \"N\" elements is greater than \"N\" times the embedded element directivity; however, in this case the mutual coupling and passive reflection produce an active reflection coefficient that results in an array gain lower than \"N\" times the embedded element gain. In fact, higher superdirectivity always implies lower gain, relative to embedded element gain."
"Some fundamental limitations on radiation pattern nulling inherent in any multiple-beam antenna system are derived. The specific case of a satellite multiple-beam antenna at synchronous altitude operating over the earth field of view is considered in detail, although the general results are presented so as to be applicable to an arbitrary planar aperture such as a phased array. The multiple-beam antenna offers the large aperture needed for good nulling resolution, while keeping the number of signal ports utilized in any nulling algorithm at a tractable number. Two specific modes of operation are considered: an earth-coverage mode, in which one desires to null a number of interfering sources while realizing the best possible earth-coverage communications link over the remaining earth field of view; and a maximum signal mode, where one desires only to maximize the signal to a specified number of users while nulling the interfering sources. Both cases are treated in detail. Optimum results are derived for an arbitrary planar aperture and compared to what can be accomplished with a fixed set of beams (the case of 7 and 19 beams are considered). For the earth-coverage mode, the quality of the earth-coverage radiation pattern versus beam position must be traded off with the optimum beam position for good nulling-i.e., it will be shown that the set of beams which gives the flatest earth-coverage radiation pattern with no prescribed nulls is not optimum when nulls are to be formed. The optimum beam positioning is determined using the results of two-dimensional sampling theory. Furthermore, the earth-coverage constraint is seen to severely limit the gain available to a signal source near the null, relative to the maximum signal mode. The maximum directivity available to a user in the maximum signal mode is also shown to be a function of beam position. For signal sources close to the edge of the field of view, the directivity available to the source can be significantly less than optimum."
"The influence of path azimuth on fade and space diversity statistics associated with propagation along earth-satellite paths at a frequency of 18 GHz is examined. The approach utilizes the methods employed by Goldhirsh and Robison [1], and Goldhirsh [2], in which a radar rain reflectivity data base obtained during the summer of 1973 is injected into a modeling program and the attenuation along parallel earth-satellite paths are obtained for a conglomeration of azimuths. In this work the statistics are separated into two groupings: one pertaining to earth-satellite paths oriented in the northwest-southeast and the other in the northeast-southwest quadrants using a fixed elevation angle of45/deg. The latter case shows fading to be greater with a degraded space diversity suggesting rain cells to be elongated along this direction. Great circle distance intervals along which the path attenuations are greater than a fixed threshold level (i.e., 2 dB) are defined here as \"attenuation cell sizes.\" These cell dimensions are analyzed for both sets of quadrants and are found to have average values which are larger by 2 km in the northeast-southwest quadrants; a result consistent with the fade and space diversity results. Examination of the wind direction for the 14 rain days of data analyzed shows good correlation of the average or median wind directions with the directions of maximum fading and degraded space diversity."
"A multipole expansion technique to study radiation from aperture antennas in the form of an open-ended waveguide-horn is presented. Particular attention is paid to dual-mode and corrugated circular horns. The radiation pattern of these feeds, derived in terms of multipole moments, is in the form of an algebraic series which converges very rapidly. Further, based on the multipole-expansion technique presented, the far-zone fields of an axially-symmetric aperture-fed paraboloid are obtained in closed form. It is demonstrated that there is a drastic reduction in computer time by using this technique instead of the conventional numerical integration procedure for calculating the far-zone fields of the paraboloid."
 "An equivalent network for square and rectangular shaped microstrip radiating elements is derived. In order to simplify the problem the radiating element is considered as two slots separated by a transmission line of low characteristic impedance. The slots are characterized by their radiation pattern, directivity, and equivalent admittance. A design procedure for open circuit halfwave resonators and for arrays of such resonators is given. Finally, some antennas in theXband are designed and measured."
"An analysis which provides the electric field distribution in the focal region of an offset parabolic reflector as a function of small scan angle has been performed. Formulae which predict both the principal and cross polarized fields have been obtained. These formulae are relatively simple and compact, provide a useful design tool, and allow efficient computer calculation. The results obtained from these formulae compare favorably with results obtained by other authors."
"The deformation of metallic flat plates into cylindrical segments, or the shielding of flat plates by such segments, reduces the large specular echo but may not necessarily reduce the mean cross section by more than 1 dB or so. A useful reduction in the mean return can be achieved only if the angle subtended by the cylindrical segment is significantly greater than the angular base interval over which the mean is taken. For all save very small intervals, the radar cross section reduction is independent of frequency."
"Field patterns of a VHF directional antenna submerged in a lake are shown with the receiver both under and over the surface of the water. The measured relative strength of the electric field as a function of the radial distance from the source is also shown. The rate of decrease with distance of the radial component of the field in the water agrees with theoretical predictions."
"An eccentrically insulated dipole antenna with two layers of insulation behaves mathematically like a lossy transmission line when the antenna is immersed in a relatively dense medium. The parameters of the equivalent transmission line are obtained. They are found to be quite different from those of a similar antenna with a single insulation layer."
"Ion waves launched by a dipole exciter are investigated. The observed radiation patterns due to the exciter are found to be in accord with the theoretical results. The dipole exciter may be a useful method to reduce the pseudowave component."
"A mathematical model for non-Rayleigh microwave sea echo is developed which describes explicitly the dependence of statistical properties of the radar cross section on the area of sea surface illuminated by the radar. In addition to the first probability distribution of the scattered radiation, its temporal and spatial correlation functions are also considered. It is shown that, in general, these correlation functions decay on at least two scales, the second, non-Rayleigh, contributions being strongly dependent on the properties of a \"single scatterer.\" Predictions of the model are found to be in qualitative agreement with existing experimental data. A new class of probability distributions, the \"K-distributions,\" is introduced, which may prove useful for fitting such data."
"Results of an experiment to determine the feasibility of monitoring corn growth with radar are reported. Radar backscattering data were acquired with a ground based 8-18 GHz radar spectrometer during the summer of 1974. Supporting ground truth data were also collected. During the month of July the crop suffered from a water deficit, although by no means was the crop destroyed by this lack of moisture. At angles of incidence of40\\degor greater, the results of the data analysis indicate a strong correlation between the radar backscattering coefficient\\sigma\\degand the \"normalized plant water content\"W_{pn}, whereW_{pn}is the mass of water in the corn plant divided by its height. The correlation coefficient between\\sigma\\degandW_{pn}, which was calculated for each of 176 different combinations of the radar parameters (signal frequency, angle of incidence and polarization), was highest (0.96) at 17.0 GHz,50\\degVV polarization. Considering the fact that the data used covered a period of four months during which the corn plants underwent considerable change in geometry and dielectric properties, the high correlation of 0.96 between\\sigma\\degandW_{pn}points to a promising future for radar as a tool for monitoring corn development."
      "A physical optics solution is presented for the scattering of plane waves from a perfectly conducting corrugated surface in the case of waves incident from an arbitrary direction and for an observer far from the surface. This solution is used to compute the radar cross section of the surface in the case of backscatter from irregular (i.e., stochastic) corrugations. An interesting feature of the solution is the occurrence of singularities in the scattered fields. These singularities appear to be a manifestation of focussing by the surface at its \"stationary\" points. Whether or not the singularities occur in the solution depends on the manner in which one restricts the analysis to the far-field."
"With this issue the IEEE efforts to provide a forum for the electrical engineers who have become very much a part of the oceanic engineering field have passed another milestone. The IEEE Oceanography Committee (OCC), consisting of representatives from seventeen groups and societies, was formed to provide a base from which the IEEE could manage its involvement in the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) with eight other organizations and to sponsor a new ocean-oriented conference series, the first of which took place at Panama City, FL, in September 1970. The committee has continued to participate in OTC and also continued to sponsor the ocean series conferences which were held successively after Panama City at San Diego, CA (Ocean '71), Newport, RI (Ocean '72), Seattle, WA (Ocean '73), and Halifax, N.S. (Ocean '74). Ocean '75 was held in San Diego under the joint sponsorship of both the IEEE and MTT and Ocean '76 will be held in Washington, DC, also under the same joint sponsorship. It is because of the above series of conferences that this Journal was started. A study by the IEEE/OCC in 1974 determined that many of the authors of papers given in the ocean series conferences felt that they had no appropriate journal to formally publish their work. Thus the OCC undertook to start such a publication. To take on this new responsibility, the OCC, under IEEE bylaws, was organized to become the Council on Oceanic Engineering in 1975 with a membership of 17 G/S and, as such, continues the old OCC activities with the additional responsibility of publishing this Journal. The IEEE Council on Oceanic Engineering sincerely hopes that this Journal will serve a real need in the electrical-oriented oceanic engineering field."
  "A high-resolution underwater acoustic pulse-Doppler navigation system has been developed and tested at sea. The system provides continuous, highly accurate tracking of underwater and ocean-surface platforms in a fixed 50-km2navigation net. Three reference buoys, moored 20 m from the ocean bottom, provide the navigation net used by shipboard processing equipment. Each reference buoy contains an acoustic transponder, used to obtain the acoustic travel times from the transponder to the platform, and a continuous-tone beacon, used to obtain the Doppler shift due to platform motion. The system is capable of determining the position of a platform with respect to the reference net with an error of 2-3 m. The relative position of the platform on a fix-to-fix basis can be determined within several centimeters over short time intervals (\\approx 10min)."
"An approach for the design of line arrays which synthesizes array factors having desired attributes is developed. This approach draws upon, clarifies, and expands earlier developments in nonuniformly positioned line-array design. A new array with important characteristics, called the square-root design, is derived. The approach is also applied to formulation and evaluation of design tradeoff studies. Specific examples are given for exponential and square-root arrays."
"By means of the in situ pulse-light fluorometer Variosens the fluorescent substance uranin was used to detect small water bodies. In mixture with a big river (Elbe) a quantity of 40-g uranin only was sufficient for tracer activities during 2 h and was a factor of about 50 above basic noise. It has been found that uranin in turbid water is highly superior to all kinds of rhodamine."
"The quantitative measurement of the dispersion of matter in large bodies of water, e.g., in ocean currents [1], needs an optoelectronic fluorometer of very high sensitivity due to the great quantities of the required fluorescent substances like rhodamine B or fluorescein that would otherwise be required. The basis of a new tracer technology of very high sensitivity is the use of pulsed bluish light for excitation [6], [7]. The instrument described here is known as the Variosens. It is able to measure concentrations of fluorescent substances down to10^{-11}and has a logarithmic scale covering a concentration range of about 1:3000. The fluorescence is excited by means of a xenon spark at a frequency of 10/s with stabilized light emission. A wide-band optical filter defines the exact spectral range of the required exciting light. The receiver operates with a narrow-band optical filter by measuring the fluorescent radiation of the tracer substance used. This filter must have a very high blocking factor. Without filters the instrument uses backscatter to measure the quantity of suspended particles in the water in milligrams/liter."
"The coupling between a coaxial array of six ferroelectric shells and its fluid environment is computed by an application of N-port theory. Properties of the lowest (\"breathing\") mode of the shells are determined by using three-dimensional finite elements, and this knowledge is utilized in defining an N-port representation of the array. An N-port representation of the external fluid is obtained by solving the Helmholtz integral equation that relates fluid velocities and pressure on the exterior of the array. The two N-ports are coupled together in a standard circuit-theoretic manner to produce an equation for the electrical driving-point impedance of the loaded projector. Several frequency responses, which illustrate the effects of varying certain parameters are presented."

"In this work a bottom return signal model and accompanying signal processor are described for a wide swath bottom mapping system. An incoherent scattering model is employed under the assumptions that the bottom is a random rough surface composed of a large number of independent scatters with spatial correlation distance negligible relative to the ensonified area. The envelope of the signal received from the various spatial directions is modeled as a smooth, nearly Gaussian-shaped function representing the effects of the twoway spatial beam pattern, angle of incidence, and depth corrupted by multiplicative and additive noise stochastic processes. A signal processor is derived which makes use of the a priori information vested in this smooth function to provide a matched filter for the received signal envelope for each spatial direction. Computer simulation results are presented and the performance of the signal processor examined in a qualitative fashion."
"For many reasons, e.g., port operations, coastal construction planning, undersea structure survival, and underwater transport, man wishes to know the extreme values that are likely to occur in coastal oceanographic variables. This paper presents a hybrid statistics/ computer simulation method that uses archived oceanographic observations to estimate confidence levels on the most extreme values likely to occur over a given period in the future. The difference from previously developed methods is the ability to estimate the most extreme value over a time period for a given probability (as opposed to estimating the probability of exceeding a given value) and the ability to obtain results from empirical data without a great deal of theoretical oceanography. The method is applied to the California coast for a period of 100 years on the following variables: bottom surge particle velocity by water depth, wave height by water depth, wavelength by water depth, wave period, current velocity, regions of high density, regions of low density, and earthquake magnitude. Values are given for the 99- and 99.9-percent probability levels."
"The design and ultimate performance of an extremely low-frequency (ELF) superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) antenna that is mounted in a submarine-towed buoy depends critically on the motion spectrum of the buoy. Motion spectrum measurements from near dc to 100 Hz were conducted on a hydrodynamically stabilized buoy while being towed in the 650-m towing basin of the David Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center, Carderock, MD. The spectra show that the angular motion of the buoy can be held to4 \\times 10^{-6}rad/\\sqrt{Hz}or less within the ELF receiver bandwidth of 30-130 Hz, as long as properly streamlined fairings are used on the hydrofoil trailing edges in order to prevent oscillations from vortex shedding. Low-frequency oscillations of the buoy were3 \\times 10^{-3}rad/\\sqrt{Hz}or less for frequencies down to 0.025 Hz. This performance of the buoy is sufficient to permit it to serve as a towed platform for the NRL prototype SQUID receiver."
"Data processing in a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging the ocean surface is affected by earth rotation, orbit eccentricity, and wave motion. Without compensation these sources will cause the images to shift in range and in-track positions and also cause defocusing. Ionospheric granularities may degrade image quality. Calculations of the magnitudes of these effects are presented."

                  "The design of electrically small receiving antennas is not a question of the received signal power, impedance bandwidth or antenna losses but only of the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) at the receiver output. Snr is limited by the field-to-noise ratio at the location of the antenna. It is shown that with a given antenna height optimum snr is only obtained if the first amplifier stage is directly connected to the antenna element. With vertical rod monopoles the optimum location for the amplifier in the antenna with respect to snr is found at a certain height above the ground. An antenna of this kind is an ideal element for a direction-finder system. The broadband pick up of undesired signals requires high linear and low noise amplifiers with a wide linearity range in order to suppress nonlinear distortions, which could deterioriate the snr. It is found, that an optimum antenna height may be determined, which in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 30 MHz is not greater than 1 m. At the present time antennas of this height and operational frequency range, which stand an undesired field intensity of 40V/m for 20dB suppression of cross modulation are produced in large quantities and are in practical application especially in mobile communication systems."
"Parabolic antenna design charts which can be used to easily determine the design parameters of radar antennas are described. Parameters used are normalized feed dimensions, F/D ratio, aperture blockage, normalized beam widths and the maximum side lobe level. Discussed topics include chart construction, a sample problem and a proposed antenna simulator."
             "The increasing in capacity on Radio Links and the limitation in places on the tower lead to group on the same antenna, as much as possible, a maximum of frequency plans. The principal frequency bands are : 1.7-2.3 GHz for 960 telephone channels (T. C) equipment, 3.6-4.2 GHz for 1800 T. C, 5.925-6.425 GHz for 1800 T.C, 6.43-7.11 GHz for 2700 T. C and 10.7-11.7 GHz for 1800 T. C. The antenna, which is, object for this paper, can operate simultaneously with four, three or two of these four frequency bands. This antenna consists of : a radiating part and a microwave multiplexer part."
    "An experimentalL-band satellite simulator has been developed which is equipped with a four-element adaptive (null-steering) receiving array and operates in conjunction with prototype time division multiple access (TDMA) modems developed previously. This simulator performs signal processing operations which result in both the accommodation of multiple (pulsed-envelope) desired signals in time sequence and the suppression of undesired signals when the sources of desired and undesired signals are adequately displaced. Most notably, the composite signals received by the four array elements are processed within an adaptive spatial processor so that the amplitude of a suitable error signal is minimized in a least mean square sense. Overviews of the configuration and performance of the experimental system are presented in this paper."
         "It was proposed [1] that an unsymmetrical surface wave propagating radially over a flat surface and having an azimuthal dependence of the form Sinn\\theta(n=1,2,3---)is a valid solution of Maxwell's equation and the value of the reactance required for the support of the wave is independent of the order of the mode. In this communication the radiation properties of a new type of surface wave horn antenna using unsymmetrical radial surface wave, by coating a thin layer of dielectric, such as Teflon, over a conductive layer of the H-plane sectoral horn has been described. The structure considered here is shown in fig.(1). The reactive surface of surface reactance, sayz_{s} = jx_{s}is confined between two vertical conducting planes at an angle of2\\alphawith each other. The vertical plates has been truncated at a suitable height where the field concentration is almost negligible. The structure considered, may be noted, has no cover at the top, being a surface wave structure."
       "A straightforward yet rigorous approach that does not require distribution theory is used to derive a generalized electric dyadic Green's function which remains valid within the source region. Although the electric field expressed by the dyadic Green's function proves to be unique, the exact form of the dyadic itself depends upon the shape of its \"principle volume.\" The dependence on principle volume is determined explicitly, and the different Green's dyadics derived by previous authors are shown to emerge merely through the appropriate choice for the principle volumes."
    "This work deals with the question of antenna response to a non-planar incidence, and with methods facilitating the extraction of the desired far-field pattern. The primary objective is to allow antenna measurements to be carried out under non-ideal conditions. Far-field antenna measurements are standardly performed with the antenna, operating in its receiving mode, excited by an incident plane wave. All of the antenna's far-field characterizing parameters are defined with respect to its plane wave response. The generation of an uncorrupted plane wave often becomes a rather difficult and at times logistically impossible task. Such difficulties are encountered in conventional ranges (insufficient range, ground and other multipath effects, etc.), in compact ranges (phase front distortions due to edge diffraction and reflector imperfections, \"stray radiation\", etc.), and are bound to reappear regardless of the measurement method. Much effort, ingenuity and expense must be and has been invested in the attempts to achieve desired plane wave excitations of sufficient purity. The conceptually straightforward data processing techniques proposed in this research, although limited to one-dimensional phase-front distortions, will greatly reduce the need to accurately realize a planar phase front. The processing is not only conceptually simple, but it is efficient owing to the use of the FFT algorithm combined with appropriate numerical filtering techniques which help reduce the required sampling rates to acceptable levels. It is emphasized that the proposed approach facilitates a complete reconstruction of the far-field including polarization data. The proposed concepts and the computational accuracy and efficiency were tested by computer simulation."
         "It has been recognized [1] - [3] that the E-plane sidelobe level of a rectangular radiating aperture can be reduced by loading the aperture with a dielectric slab in the H-plane. Such loading is advantageous in certain applications - for example, in feed horns for parabolic reflectors wherein equality of radiation patterns in E and H planes coupled with low spillover radiation is desired. This paper reports some additional results regarding the radiation characteristics of a centrally-loaded rectangular horn. The geometry of the horn considered for the purpose of theoretical calculations and experimental study. The horn is assumed to be excited in the dominant LSM11mode. Omitting analytical details, several aspects of the radiation characteristics are presented in Figs.2 through 5. In the figure captions, h stands for the thickness of the dielectric slab and\\varepsilon_{r}for its permittivity."
            "The Office of Telecommunication Policy Manual of Regulations and Procedures defines the spectral quality of the emission from radars. Design and evaluation of active phased array antennas to comply with spectral emission requirements involves a determination of the amplitude and phase of the fundamental and harmonic excitation components of the array elements. A study has been made of microwave amplifier modules designed for phased array antenna service. Output amplitude and phase behaviour has been measured under mismatched load conditions at fundamental and harmonic frequencies. A bridge has been used that is capable of being balanced at fundamental, second and third harmonics. Reference signals at these frequencies are adjusted in amplitude and phase to cancel the corresponding components produced by the amplifier under test. The amplitude and phase variations of the waves travelling out of the amplifier are measured as a function of load mismatch. A standard test load is used to present to the amplifier output, the impedances that lie on a selected series of VSWR circles on a Smith chart. The test load is not a replica of the dynamic impedance of any particular chosen element in a phased array but the data gathered can be used to provide amplitude and phase data for radiation pattern calculations if the dynamic impedance of each antenna element in known. Results obtained using the load are presented as equi-power and equi-phase contours in the overall region of load variation.L- andS-band bipolar transistor modules designed for phased array antenna service and various experimentalS-band TRAPATT amplifiers have been studied. In the modules it is found that harmonic levels are below 35 dB down on the fundamental and are subject to large variations with load change. In some cases the variation of harmonic output is a function of the load impedance at the fundamental but more frequently it depends upon the impedance presented at the harmonic. In the case of TRAPATTS it has been essential to operate them in a two circulator assembly. Less variation of harmonic level is observed with load change. Levels only 23 dB down on the fundamental are found in some units whereas in others greater than 50 dB has been observed. In the former higher level case it was found that behaviour was not affected greatly by changing the diode in the circuit and it is inferred from this that behaviour regarding harmonic levels in the output is mainly determined by the microwave circuit."
        "The reasons for, and the differences between non-ionizing radiation \"standards\" across the world are first discussed, together with the methods used to measure power density. The reported nervous system and behavioural effects of electromagnetic waves, many of which occur at low field strengths, and over a wide range of frequencies, are then summarized. Coordinated work at both the macro and microscopic levels - from animal behaviour to the study of intra and extra-cellular ionic movements - is being undertaken. A cohesive theory may now be emerging on effects induced at the bio-electronic level. Methods for studying field interaction with neural tissue, enhanced tissue healing, possibly through leucocyte depression, effects on small organisms as well as behavioural changes from long term exposure, require the specification of precise and repeatable field conditions, over a wide range of frequencies, pulse rates and environmental factors. In this context the question of actual field strengths and energy deposition (or absorption) vs incident power density presents measurement problems. The paper emphasises the need for verifying existing work and replacing some vague speculations with reliable data from multi-disciplinary research."
     "The RCA Satcom antenna is described with reference to its cross-polarization performance. A technique of achieving high cross-polarization isolation in excess of 33dB anywhere in the coverage of an8.4\\deg \\times 3.2\\degbeam has been developed using pairs of reflectors with an overlapping geometry. The technique allows accomodation of multiple linearly-polarized reflectors within the confines of the Delta 3914 launch vehicle shroud. Measured data both on the antenna test range and in orbit has confirmed the approach. In-orbit whole-system cross-polarization isolations of greater than 34 dB between adjacent channels have been measured on the two-way New York - Los Angeles link."
    "In remote sensing problems for continuous inhomogeneous media, the Born approximation is used conveniently for tenuous, slowly changing media. The Rytov approximation is known, under certain circumstances, to give more accurate indication than the Born approximation, we have introduced an improvement that further increases the range of validity of the Rytov approximation. Some numerical results are presented to illustrate the advantages of the method introduced over that of Born and Rytov."
    "TheS.-band toroidal pattern antenna for the Meteosat satellite consists of two elements, one transmitting and one receiving, mounted side-by-side. Each of the two elements is constituted by a vertical array of slots cut on both the broad walls of a reduced height waveguide, operating on the TE10mode. General design criteria have favoured a dual antenna system solution: one part formed by waveguides in hard-machined aluminum alloy, the other part consisting of a cylindrical cover in die lectric honey-comb with an aluminum base to achieve a high dynamical behavior for the antenna."
            "The most important specification of an electrically small transmitting antenna is the ratio of the radiated power over the available power of a generator. This ratio and its bandwidth decrease considerably with decreasing antenna height. With a receiving antenna however, not the received power but the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) in the receiving system is of importance. Due to the received external noise at low frequencies the bandwidth of the snr of a receiving antenna with receiver circuit is many orders of magnitude greater than the power bandwidth that may be obtained with an antenna of equivalent height. This snr bandwidth will be evaluated quantitatively as a function of the antenna temperature, the noise characteristics of an amplifier network and of the radiator bandwidth. Antenna losses will be taken into account. With short resonant antennas maximum snr bandwidth is only obtained with a considerable noise mismatch at center frequency. Curves of minimum required antenna height versus the center frequencyf_{o}are evaluated for different values of snr bandwidth. For median values of antenna temperatureT_{A}and an snr bandwidth of not greater than 30% the required height of a rod antenna is at no frequency greater than 70cm in the total range from 10kHz to 1GHz. A comparison shows that minimum required height of a transmitting antenna at low frequencies is many orders of magnitude greater than of a receiving antenna. The common line between a passive rod antenna and the matching network in the receiver causes a considerable reduction of the achievable bandwidth. By means of an amplifier, being directly connected to a capacitive radiator, short and extremely broadband active receiving antennas can be realized, the snr/snr_{\\max}-curve of which is of low-pass character."
 "Each year thousands of boreholes are drilled into the Earth. Electromagnetic, Acoustic, Radiation, and other devices are suspended in these holes to record data pertaining to the physical composition of the subsurface formations. These data will, hopefully, help us to locate oil, gas, coal, minerals, and water. In the search for oil and gas, wells have been drilled to depths of nearly six miles. Temperatures in excess of500\\degF and pressures above 20,000 psi, although not experienced every day, are becoming more common. In addition to these subsurface methods, several surface methods are employed in geophysical applications. This paper concentrates on describing the Electromagnetic techniques that have been found useful in the quest for new energy sources, the location of mineral deposits and even potable water. Techniques for measuring naturally occuring electromagnetic phenomena such as Spontaneous Potential and Telluric currents are described. Measurements using man-generated electromagnetic fields are also discussed. These include descriptions of the Schlumberger and Wenner electrode arrays, laterologs, normals, focussed electrode arrays, induction devices, nuclear magnetic resonance methods, and electromagnetic propagation techniques. Examples of results from several of the techniques are presented. Methods of interpretation of the data, in conjunction with data from the aforementioned acoustic and radiation devices are also described."
"In simplest terms, ETUR is a conventional radar without the carrier. A narrow pulse is transmitted into the ground and a pulse scattered from any asymmetrical target (w.r.t. the antenna axis of symmetry) is observed on an electrically isolated receiving antenna. The pulse width is sufficiently narrow so that the transmitted pulse magnitude has become negligible when the scattered pulse arrives at the antenna terminals. These and other essential features of the ETUR system will be discussed. By careful design, these two mechanisms, the short pulse width and the antenna isolation provide a reasonably clear range window. This allows the reflected pulse to be observed in real time on the oscilloscope display. Experimental results will be presented in terms of this reflected pulse. These include the reflected pulses obtained from infinite metal and plastic pipe, finite length pipes and other finite sized objects, geological structures such as faults, joints and fractured rock zones, tunnels and coal mines. A commercial version of ETUR using a trade name Terrascan for the detection of buried pipes should be available at the time this paper is presented."
                "This paper describes a wideband adaptive array employing a recursive transversal filter. This array is then compared to a similar wideband adaptive array employing a non-recursive transversal filter. Because of correlation between successive time samples, the recursive filter in general results in smaller error for the same complexity or less complexity for the same error. Control of the recursive filter is more complicated than for the non-recursive filter, however, because of interdependence between poles and zeros. The paper suggests two possible recursive implementations and develops an algorithm for setting and adjusting the weights."
"The design of adaptive antennas is considered from the point of view of topology, index of performance, and algorithms to be used. First, the topology of a generalized linear adaptive network is shown to reduce to the network topology now in popular use in the adaptive antenna field, and the advantages and disadvantages of it as well as others are reviewed. The indicies of perfomance most widely used which include Least Mean Squared Error (LMSE) and Signal to Noise ratio (S/N), are reviewed and compared. More effective indicies are recommended. These include an index which maximizes S/N subject to a constraint on beam bandwidth, one which uses a weighting of interference (jammer) power as well as angle (which enables more efficient elimination of interferences near the signal although having lower power); an index which limits the magnitude of the gains as well as maximizes S/N; and one more suitable for tracking time varying signals. Algorithms are then compared for use with the above indicies and topology. The broad classes include gradient algorithms and stochastic approximation algorithms, and are compared with respect to complexity, speed, and implementation. The integration of the above aspects results in a complete adaptive antenna system. Following a brief summary of the various techniques used (e.g. null steering, side lobe cancellers, etc.) in terms of these three points of view, the evaluation of adaptive antenna systems is considered using interactive computer graphics. A description of the minicomputer based system used in the study is given, and dynamic results which demonstrate the effect of algorithms and performance index choice are shown as developed on the system. The usefulness of interactive computer graphics in the design and evaluation phase is emphasized."

"A moment method solution for thin wire antennas in the presence of lossy and inhomogeneous dielectric and/or ferrite bodies is presented."
 "Frequency-scanned antenna arrays usually employ a sinuous feed to obtain a high frequency sensitivity [1], [2]. It has been realized [1] that this effect can alternatively be produced by using a slow-wave feed, such as a helix, in place of the more commonly employed TEM-line or waveguide feed. Such a feed system can be made quite compact and lightweight as compared to the latter types of feed. In this paper, a structure consisting of a coaxial line with a corrugated inner conductor is examined as an array feed. The radiating elements are transversely out half-wavelength slots on the outer conductor and constitute a uniformly spaced linear array. The absorber at the end of the feed ensures that the array is excited in the traveling-wave mode."
 "This paper is for the non-telecommunications engineer or scientist who is interested in the sea and who may have wondered about some things in the submarine cable business but never bothered to ask. It discusses the beginnings of transocean cable telephony and the state of the art today. The activities required to bring a modern seacable system into being, what is being done to reduce interruptions, and what cable does if anything to the environment, are discussed. A forecast of possible future cable developments is made."

"Land-locked as well as maritime nations are displaying an increasing interest in the enormous potential of marine resources. The investigations engendered by this interest require - and generate - both scientific and technical information about the marine environment and the means of coping with that environment. The importance of prompt and accurate dissemination of such information on an international basis is recognized by the United Nations, and its Ocean Economics and Technology Office has been asked to encourage such interchange. The authors will give a summary of the UN's current and forthcoming activities in this area."
"The essence of technology transfer is the effective passing of information, which requires that the receiving party accept new-to-him information in organized form. This is no small requirement in a period of exponentially increasing volumes of scientific observations and their technical applications. Traditional methods of scientific and technical communications will not be adequate to assure timely and discriminating dissemination of this information, and the National Science Foundation has established a program to support research in novel methods. Special emphasis is placed on use of audio and video telecommunications, computers and automatic means of recording, storing, disseminating and retrieving information. The author will cite specific examples of projects for which grants have been made and will describe the directions in which the NSF hopes to stimulate research and development."
"The MIT Marine Industry Collegium is a partnership between the MIT Sea Grant Program and sponsoring companies, that is based on two premises: first, that the MIT Sea Grant Program can help a diverse industrial constituency by bringing to its attention the business implications or market opportunities resulting from selected marine research activities; second, that MIT and other Sea Grant institutions can benefit from interaction with industrial members, who provide critiques and evaluations of research activities and proposals, who suggest research subjects for independent on-going projects, and who provide important data for research and advisory services at MIT. Eighty corporate members participated in the Collegium Program which was initiated in July 1975. This technology transfer program has provided a vehicle for members to work together, with the MIT Sea Grant Program and with other Sea Grant institutions."
"A nation whose coastal areas, offshore as well as onshore, are becoming more intensively developed and utilized must recognize the potential property damage as well as loss of life and cost of injuries that may result from increasing vulnerability to natural hazards such as hurricanes, accompanying tornadoes, and other storms. These will have an impact on communications as well as boat and vessel accidents, also near-shore and off-shore installations. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of safe and effective use of the marine environment and the need for increasing attention and evaluation. Perhaps nowhere is the need for environmental data and analysis so great as it is in dealing with environmental hazards."
"A navigation and tracking system using a phase locked loop has been investigated for high accuracy short range applications. Studies and laboratory experimentation indicate that an accuracy of 0.1 m. is within feasibility limits. The ranging system features continuous operation in an analog mode with high noise immunity, and all controls are TTL compatible. Immediate applications include precision seismic profiling surveys, cable placement, narrow channel navigation, and precision location of open sea bench marks. System modularity and off the shelf parts minimize cost and maximize effectiveness. Operator interaction is minimal, and cost per meter of accuracy is far below other presently available systems."
"The ADRAMS buoy was developed to provide remote tracking of drifting sea ice near the Arctic coast. The air droppable feature was employed to reduce the high cost of deployment inherent to manual installation and to provide access to deployment areas and seasons of the year not previously suitable. ADRAMS contains a 401.2 MHz transmitter and suitable digital encoding to allow it to be received by the NIMBUS-6 satellite. This satellite contains a random access measurement system (RAMS) package. The RAMS system determines the position of the ADRAMS buoys to an accuracy of better than 5 KM thru doppler measurements of the received signal. The buoy is deployed via its own parachute and is designed to survive and properly orient its antenna on any type of terrain. The 80 pound package contains enough batteries for 7 to 8 months operation at surface temperatures as low as-50\\degC. Although the original ADRAMS was designed for tracking only, it has been modified to incorporate a capability for sensor data telemetry. The RAMS system in the NIMBUS-6 satellite accepts 32 bits of data from each transmission. Nineteen ADRAMS buoys have been deployed thus far; 17 in the Arctic and 2 in the Antarctic. The air drops have been 100% successful."
 "Torque-free operation is an essential performance requirement in today's ocean cable constructions. Torsional information is needed to properly select, design and specify cables. The fastest and most economical way of obtaining such information is by model simulations. Several models have recently been developed for specific purposes. One of these models, the helical model TAWAC developed by CEL, applies to both single and multistrand steel cables. For a given twist and elongation, TAWAC yields the corresponding torque and tension. An example is given to demonstrate the usefulness of TAWAC in cable selection, design and specification. Two multistrand cables with steel armors are simulated by TAWAC and the torsional response was found to be inadequate for the intended applications. By varying the pitch lengths nearly true torque-free designs were achieved."
"A method for stress and torque analysis of a steel armored Electromechanical mooring cable is presented and is compared with test results. The cable studied in this paper has an electrical core around which is helical wound two layers of armor. When the armor wires are loaded they develop torque and rotate. They also move radially; the amount of movement depends on the core hardness. This paper will limit itself to a soft core. Equations are developed to determine cable torque, torque unbalance, rotation, wire elongation, and stress. Empirical data is presented to determine cable modulus and elongation. Finally, this paper discusses actual torque balance and cable strength tests of electromechanical cables. Computed results are compared to test data for two cables. Very good agreement was achieved with test data in both cases."
"Since shortly after the first submarine telegraph cable installations in the early 1800's, underwater power cables have been implanted and used. Initial acceptance and use of such cables was slow, however, and only accellerated in the past half-century with the replacement of natural rubber insulations. This paper will look into many of the considerations involved in the installation and utilization of submarine or underwater power cables in the long lengths required in most systems. Some of the design considerations involved, some of the types of cables employed, a survey of some of the electrical considerations involved, the dynamics and mechanics of installation will also be discussed. Some thoughts on the future of submarine power cables will be presented."
"Pictographic data or imagery is commonly used in marine exploration. Preexisting image processing techniques (software) similar to those used on imagery obtained from unmanned planetary exploration were used to improve marine photography and side-scan sonar imagery. Features and details not visible by conventional photo processing methods were enhanced by filtering and noise removal on selected deep-sea photographs. Information gained near the periphery of photographs allows improved interpretation and facilitates construction of bottom mosaics where overlapping frames are available. Similar processing techniques were applied to side-scan sonar imagery, including corrections for slant range distortion, and along-track scale changes. The use of digital data processing and storage techniques greatly extends the quantity of information that can be handled, stored, and processed."
"A vector magnetic gradiometer array has been developed for the purpose of detecting, tracking, and surveying undersea, sub-bottom transmission cables and lines. The system is designed to be carried by the SCARAB vehicle or similar controlled submersibles. The basic sensor unit in the array consists of a combination of a 3-axis fluxgate vector component magnetometer and a single axis gradiometer utilizing a pair of aligned fluxgate sensors. Theoretical models of the magnetic fields of extended (linear) cables and lines are presented. These models are compared with empirical data obtained from magnetometer measurements in the vicinity of real cables having intrinsic ferromagnetic materials of high permeability and carrying electric currents. Data outputs for various sensor array geometries are compared, and criteria for optimum sensitivity of detection, tracking, and survey are discussed. Results of field tests of the system are presented and evaluated. The applications of the system for A.C. tone detection are also considered."
"The navigator of an ocean-going ship which transits the high seas, coastal waters, and restricted waters of a harbor entrance is faced with a requirement to fix his position with increasing accuracy and frequency. There may be a need to automate some part, or all, of his navigation processes. Loran-C can satisfy many navigation requirements, but there is a need for additional development before the navigator of an ocean-going ship can use Loran-C to the full extent of its capability. The U. S. Coast Guard is proceeding with a program to maximize the usefulness of the planned Loran-C system for the Coastal/Confluence Zone, to define the requirements for navigation in specific harbor areas, and to identify the information needs of shipboard navigators."
"This paper reports on the development of a Marine Radar Interrogator-Transponder (MRIT). Unfortunately, all vessel paints on a radar PPI look alike. As a result, when a ship master caught in a fog is trying to use his radio-telephone to work out a maneuvering plan with another vessel, it is difficult for him to identify which blip on the PPI is the source of the voice on the radio. One solution now receiving worldwide attention is to fit all vessels with active transponders. MRIT's are an advanced form that provide not only target identity and \"clutter-free\" target paints but also maneuvering information and such data as target's course, speed, draft, safe or dangerous cargo, etc. Mounted on a fixed navigation aid they can also function as racons. The paper describes the operational parameters and reviews the system bench tests and sea trials."
 "A summary of specific data quality estimates for the major buoy systems now operationally deployed by the NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) is provided. Quality estimates are included for four distinct buoy types: (1) The Prototype Environmental Buoy (PEB) - deep ocean moored, (2) the Engineering Experimental Phase Buoy (EEP) - deep ocean moored, (3) the 5.0m Discus Buoy - shallow ocean moored, and (4) the NOMAD Buoy - shallow or deep ocean moored. The quality estimates presented are a result of in situ and laboratory testing, computer modeling, and analytical evaluations. Total quality estimates, or total system errors, and some examples of total system error breakdowns into component errors, are provided for some general environmental situations. Detailed quality estimates such as these are important since efficient uses of data from measurement platforms such as buoys are dependent on a comprehensive understanding of the accuracy of the data."
"Historically, the scientific mooring community has had a pressing requirement for the capability of installing lightweight easily deployed deep sea surface moorings to collect, record and/or transmit near surface measurements. Past surface mooring designs have not adapted themselves to provide a stable, low noise platform to eliminate the contamination of data caused by mooring motion. These requirements have now been addressed and a unique two-stage mooring has been designed to help alleviate these problems. The mooring incorporates braided KEVLAR mechanical and electro-mechanical cable to obtain a lightweight, compliant system which utilizes syntactic foam line floats as the main floatation. A series of trim floats at the air/sea interface used in conjunction with a stable low drag surface buoy results in decreased dynamic loading in the mooring line, which increases total system lifetime due to smaller fatigue values. Also, a new, hard polyurethane jacket on the electro-mechanical cable helps to protect it from possible fishbite attack. A complete mechanical system (void of electronics) was designed and deployed in a water depth of 1500 meters for a period of 4 months in the TOTO. The objectives of the test were to determine the mechanical compatibility and minimum lifetime capability of the mooring that could be expected in the ocean open. Also, the knowledge gained through this test will be used to optimize future designs for presently needed applications."
"Global and synoptic views of the sea surface are now available from satellite photography and multispectral scanners. Classifications of patterns visible on the sea surface, such as eddies, convergences, divergences, Karman vortices, dark spots (upwellings), etc. have been reported by various authors, (Stevenson, Larson, and Kober, 1970). The obvious questions of how many different patterns exist on the ocean surface, and have all possible patterns been observed and how do they relate to oceanic morphogenesis, i.e., the patterns of ever changing currents, can be related to recent progress in differential topology. \"Catastrophy Theory\" is a popular name for this branch of mathematics in which patterns are separated into \"forms\" (patterns of limit points) and \"non forms\" (patterns without limit points). \"Forms\" in two dimensions are limited in numbers and account for the observed oceanic patterns. \"Non forms\" correspond to turbulence."
"A newly developed electronic fish tracking system to automatically monitor the movements and migratory habits of fish is reported. The system is aimed particularly at studies of effects on fish life of industrial facilities which use rivers or lakes to dump their effluents. Location of fish is acquired by means of acoustic links from the fish to underwater Listening Stations, and by radio links which relay tracking information to a shore-based Data Base. Fish over 4 inches long may be tracked over a5 \\times 5mile area. The electronic fish tracking system provides the marine scientist with electronics which permit studies that were not practical in the past and which are cost-effective compared to manual methods."
"The NASA Langley Research Center, in collaboration with NOAA-Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories, Miami, Florida, has conducted an investigation to determine the feasibility of tracking Woodhead bottom drifters instrumented with miniature acoustic transmitters that have been developed for fish-tracking applications. Demonstration cruises with the R/V Annandale (Marine Science Consortium) were made at the entrance of Delaware Bay, and near the sewage-sludge dump site in the New York Bight. The results of these tracking missions showed that Lagrangian information on inferred bottom-water circulation, caused by tidal and other nonstorm effects, could be provided by sonar tracking of acoustic Woodhead drifters."
"This paper describes a computer simulation of a radar altimeter for use in sea wave profile measurement. The simulation forms part of a wider study being carried out by the National Physical Laboratory, Division of Maritime Science. (Shortly to become the Institute of Marine Science). The particular merits and difficulties of the radar altimeter for this application are discussed and comparison made with available alternatives. The basic programming technique employed is to first simulate the impulse response of the radar above a specified sea. The transient response for any transmitted pulse shape is then found using the convolution integral. This transient response can then be applied to a simulated receiver characteristic in order to predict the performance of the instrument."
"Although the South Texas Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has been aseismic, crustal movements have been virtually continuous. The two principal types of movement have been seaward subsidence of the shelf and folding of strata by a combination of seaward creep and diapiric movement of low density material. Faulting has been extensive and has migrated seaward. Surficial benthic sediments are typically fine-grained (<0.063 mm). The average rate of deposition over the past 18,000 years seems to have been about 1 meter per thousand years. Sediment modification by infaunal activity ranges from high on the inner OCS to low on the outer part. Concentrations of cadmium, chromium, lead, and vanadium are highest in an area of suspected gas seeps at the shelf edge. Higher amounts of barium on the inner shelf are associated with petroleum fields."
"This paper provides a very general description of the BO'SUN and Sea Beam multibeam sonar systems. They are the latest multi-beam sonar systems to be marketed by the General Instrument Corporation. The data flow necessary to process the sonar signals in each system is described."
"A doppler sonar technique capable of measuring ground speed and distance travelled at extreme ocean depths is described. The technique uses non-linear acoustic effects to create the narrow beams required. Performance estimates are calculated and parameters for a test system chosen. Sonar-Pond test results of transmitter beam patterns and source levels are given. The sea trials conducted in July and August of 1975, aboard the R.V. SPERRY STAR off New Providence Island, are described. Evaluation of data taken in water depths to 11,000 feet is made and substantial agreement with original estimates is demonstrated. The feasibility of an accurate, all ocean capability, dead reckoning navigator is thus confirmed."
"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been conducting a multidisciplinary, multimillion dollar environmental studies program designed to determine the impact of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas, exploration, development, and production activities. Data derived from this program are put into the minerals management decision-making process at many different levels. This paper briefly describes the objectives and rationale behind the design and implementation of those studies, and serves as an introduction to subsequent papers dealing with specific BLM-sponsored studies."
"Near-bottom acoustically navigated vehicles and a multi-narrow beam bathymetric charting system have been utilized for seafloor mapping in the FAMOUS rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. A tethered device system (ANGUS) incorporating either a camera fish, rock dredge, corer, or heat probe is used for broad areal survey coverage. A manned submersible (ALVIN) is then deployed to investigate first hand specific sites of geologic interest. The vehicles can be tracked with a precision of 20 meters along a simultaneously collected high resolution bathymetric profile. Vehicle paths can be located relative to ultra-high resolution multi-beam bathymetric charts (SONARRAY) with a precision of 200 meters. Such precise integration has allowed meaningful extrapolation of observations between vehicle tracks useful for geologic mapping studies in the FAMOUS fracture zone B and other nearby areas."
"The in-water Light Behind Camera (LIBEC) technique permits order-of-magnitude increases in the area photographed by suspending the camera beneath the zone of range-limiting backscattered light. Mapping the sea floor with strips of overlapping LIBEC photographs obtained from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is shown to be valuable for: (a) showing relationships between major surface faunal populations and sediment characteristics (b) resolving features of relief intermediate in size (1 to 50 meters) between those revealed by conventional photography and those portrayed by narrow-beam sonar (c) producing improved-quality photomosaics (d) providing unambiguous navigational ties at track crossings"
"The development of marine education in the United States has been severely handicapped by lack of a national position which states that marine education is important. Marine education refers not only to the motivation, training and education of marine specialists capable of meeting national needs at all levels but to an informed citizenry sufficiently aware of the importance of the oceans and marine environment to take part in or to influence national marine policy. The Sea Grant Program, working closely with the Commissioner and Office of Education, is the proper Federal Program to assume leadership in development of such a policy. For a national marine education policy to be accepted and implemented, the educational system of the nation must be involved in its preparation. In essence, policy development means creation of a marine education constituency with a much broader base than the present relatively small group of educators (less than a thousand) with a commitment to marine education. The Sea Grant network of colleges and institutions is the means of reaching out into the communities to build such a constituency. The process of policy development should create a new awareness of the importance of the oceans and marine environment to the nation in the inland states as well as along the coasts. The ultimate goal is a marine-literate society as well as the manpower pool of marine specialists essential to national needs."
"This is the fifth and last of a series of papers which report on the development, production and testing of a KEVLAR-armored, deep ocean, coaxial cable. Earlier papers discussed development of the tension members, a prototype cable sequence and the final design of the production cable. This paper reports on the \"as built\" properties of the same cable. It also discusses experience gained during armoring of the cable, with suggested guidelines for others to follow. Finally, it presents the results of extensive tests conducted on the final 23,000- foot cable-torque and rotation under load, stress/strain, flexure performance under load, breaking strength, breaking mode, and techniques for cable termination."
"Over a period of fifteen years our group in the Marine Physical Laboratory has developed a system for mapping various quantities associated with the deep sea floor, and has used it extensively in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although some elements of the system have been in successful use for many years, new capabilities have been added in more recent time. The basic concept is to use instruments towed close to the sea floor, thus allowing fine spatial resolution of the parameters, (or in some instances giving the possibility of measuring aspects which could not even be sensed from the sea surface). Position determination is a key element. This is achieved by use of acoustic transponders and related computational procedures which can yield accuracy of the order of a few meters. The present instrument suite includes routine use of precision echo sounder, 4 kHz bottom penetration sounder, side looking sonar, proton magnetometer, photography, television, and temperature instrumentation. In use on an intermittent basis are newer capabilities including conductivity measurement, near bottom plankton sampling, filter system to sample suspended fine particulate material, controlled water sampling, and an instrument to measure the optical properties of the water. All of the subsystems are powered and controlled from the ship, using the coaxial electrical core to the towing cable. The signals from the various sensors (hydrophones, magnetometer, thermometer, television, etc.) are telemetered up the wire using various methods geared to the requirements of the particular unit. A major recent advance has been the move toward quantitative use of the sonar systems. The 4kHz unit produces actual acoustic reflectivity information, giving the added capability in some circumstances of calculating sound absorption as well. Most recently the side-looking sonar has been adapted to produce quantitative measurements of backscattered energy."
"A Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) has been designed for the Nimbus-G Spacecraft and incorporated also into the Seasat-A payload for the primary purpose of determining sea surface temperatures and wind stress on a nearly all-weather basis. Observations of microwave polarization components will be made at wavelengths of 0.8, 1.4, 1.7, 2.8, and 4.6 cm over a swath 577 km wide below the Seasat A spacecraft. The smallest spatial resolution cell is15 \\times 23km at a wavelength of 0.8 cm, and proportionately larger at the other wavelengths. Using experimentally determined algorithms for converting the observed brightness temperatures, the indicated accuracies of the results (excluding conditions of significant rainfall) are within 1K for sea surface temperature and 2 m/sec for surface wind speeds, over a range from 0-50 m/sec."
 "The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard the Seasat-A satellite will conduct a number of experiments involving deep ocean waves, coastal wave patterns, polar ice and land forms. The SAR will have a 25m by 25m resolution over a swath of 100km width centered about 300km to the right of the spacecraft track. The SAR's high data rate limits operations to times when Seasat-A is in view of a few ground stations with special SAR receiving equipment. However, the SAR will collect much useful data about deep ocean and coastal waves in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; about ice in the Northwest Atlantic, in the Great Lakes and off the coast of Alaska; and about land over much of the United States and Canada."
"This paper summarizes recent advances in modeling the static and time dependent failure of fiber bundles. The fibers are assumed to exhibit statistical variations in tensile strength which may be influenced by the fiber load histories. The bundle load is shared among the surviving fibers at any given time according to a load sharing rule that takes into account statistical variations in the geometric and mechanical properties of the individual fibers. On a force per fiber basis, the static and fatigue strength of a bundle is less than the average strength of the fibers. The strength loss increases with increased variability in fiber strength, time-to-failure and load sharing. The variability in bundle strength however decreases with an increase in the number of fibers in the bundle. The paper gives many strength prediction relationships that will have use in the design of high strength cables and lines."
"This report describes the methods used to develop performance requirements and design characteristics of a microwave scatterometer wind sensor planned for SeaSat-A. User requirements such as wind speed accuracy, resolution cell size, grid spacing, and swath width of the measurements formed the basis for defining instrument characteristics. Results are presented that show scatterometer accuracy as a function of orbit position satisfies User requirements for nominal orbit conditions."
"A third generation satellite radar altimeter to be flown on the SEASAT-A mission in 1978 is described. Building on SKYLAB and GEOS-C experience, a design has evolved that will allow a long-term goal of 10-cm altimetry to be realized. While dependent on recent developments in surface acoustic-wave device technology, the design in all other respects presents no major difficulty. A linear FM/full-deramp waveform and processing technique allows fine range tracking to be done in the frequency domain. A digital filter bank will provide 60 contiguous samples of the ocean return waveform with 3.125-ns resolution. An adaptive tracker built around a microprocessor will operate on the waveform samples to implement the basic height tracking function, adjusting its parameters in response to sensed waveheight."
"Geographic and environmental factors have created a substantially strong marine industrial and research economy for the Pacific area. There is a definite need for educational training options to prepare Pacific Basin people to fill the diverse marine employment needs. Based on this need Leeward Community College, University of Hawaii, and Sea Grant initiated a Marine Technology Program to provide pre-service and in-service training to the Pacific Basin Area. Although the major thrust of the program is oriented towards target groups within the State of Hawaii, training needs of people throughout the Pacific island community are recognized, especially those needs in the Trust Territory of Micronesia."
"NASA Earth Observations Aircraft Program (EOAP) high-altitude photographic overflights of the Hawaiian Islands in the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft produced color transparencies on Aerochrome Infrared film and aerial color film of excellent image quality showing multiple overlapping open ocean and near shore wave patterns. These photos were used as a teaching resource in a unit on ocean waves in the Hawaii Marine Studies Science Curriculum Project. In the unit, students are introduced to fundamentals of wave phenomena through observations and measurements and are asked to analyze the complex wave patterns shown in the NASA aerial photos. Many wave phenomena are vividly shown with great clarity on these photographs. Details for obtaining duplicates of these photographs are presented."
"Scheduled for launch in the second quarter of calendar year 1978, the SEASAT-A satellite is designed to provide all-weather global monitoring of sea surface temperature, significant wave height, surface wind speed and direction and departures from the marine geoid corresponding to ocean dynamic processes. These data will be obtained from an array of microwave instruments, two active ones (short pulse radar altimeter and wind field scatterometer) and one passive (scanning multichannel microwave radiometer). An experimental L-band synthetic aperture radar, operated on a selected basis for approximately four percent of the time, will provide land and ocean images with a resolution of 25 meters and a swath width close to 100 km for the study of coastal processes, sea ice and ocean wave characteristics. The mission objectives focus on an evaluation of the performance of the instruments in terms of their capabilities to characterize the desired geophysical quantities and the utility of such measurements to the study and exploitation of the world's oceans."
"A survey of the pressure sealing characteristics of underwater electrical cables and components required for sealing to equipment is presented in terms of electrical and pressure sealing joints. Techniques for maximizing system reliability by obtaining redundant pressure seals and by minimizing the number of pressure and electrical joints presented. The qualitative comparision of reliability characteristics has been selected because of the current lack of comparative test data."
"The technology of oil filled cable systems is reviewed as a feasible approach to electric cable systems for deep ocean use. Existing technology is adequate for shallow depths but as this technology is applied to the deep ocean, cost and reliability suffer. The framework of classical cable technology as outlined in the Naval Ship Research Development Laboratory Handbook is applied to the oil filled system used on ALVIN to provide a comparison to non-oil filled performance. Cable design considerations that resulted in the choice of systems components for ALVIN are presented. The constraints on oil filled cable systems are reviewed including material compatibility, pressure head in air and water, and system servicing. The ALVIN oil-compensated system configuration is described as well as the component parts."
"A structure which we call a solar still greenhouse can provide the necessary protection from the adversities of the marine environment for many vascular plants. Utilizing seawater and sunlight, this structure distills seawater, providing freshwater for plant use. This unit can be placed anywhere that seawater is available, including arid shores, or even (with flotation) on the ocean surface. The basic design is a cubicle array of eight ft tall columns filled with lava cinders and spaced\\imath 3ft apart. These columns connected with trasparent plastic form the walls of the solar still greenhouse. Planting is done in perforations in the side of the columns, foliage growing into the central greenhouse space. Seawater in a black pan within the greenhouse is solar evaporated, with fresh water condensing on the sloping transparent roof and trickling down into the columns, bathing plant roots."
 "The current concern for the environment of local waters has caused a reevaluation of the effects of dumping dredge spoil in local waters that are used for recreational and commercial purposes. A COE approved dumping grounds at the confluence of the Thames River, CT. and Long Island Sound has been used to dispose of the dredge spoil obtained by deepening the river channel to a depth suitable to accommodate the Navy's new 688 class submarine. This paper describes a dual frequency bathymetric profiling method used to survey the spoil that has been dumped to determine if there has been any material transported from the dump site by local currents. The method provided an accurate description of the dump site as well as an accurate estimate of the volume of spoil dumped. The survey indicated that approximately 95% of the discharged material remained within the dump site."
"The prototype of an automatic oil pollution monitor using a Direct Difference Method of Total Organic Carbon Determination was built and tested. Using this monitor it was possible to specify the concentration of any oil, independent of type, in a known water sample. In the final phases of the study, preliminary investigations on oil concentration determinations in bilge water were initiated."
"In conjunction with dredging activities planned for San Diego Bay, a study was conducted to identify and investigate selected physical chemical, and biogenic parameters of sediment for use as potential tracers of material dredged from a polluted area of the bay and disposed in the EPA approved 100 fathom disposal site. Specific properties measured included grain size distribution, concentrations of cadmium, mercury, lead, oil and grease, and foraminifera species. Results of this study indicated that mercury, cadmium, and lead concentrations and foraminifera species composition can be used to distinguish dredged material from disposal site material. However, of these parameters foraminifera species composition appears to be the best indicator for monitoring the fate of dredged material disposed off San Diego, since foraminifera species abundant in the dredge site were practically nonexistent in the disposal site."
"Research investigations and monitoring of various dredging and disposal projects in the New England region have been conducted over a ten-year period commencing in 1967. In order to facilitate the management and implementation of federal, state and private dredging projects, the New England Division Corps of Engineers has adopted a regional approach to disposal of dredge material. It is proposed that the New England coastline be geographically divided into four or five regional areas. Within each management area all present and anticipated dredging activities would be described."
"Using test data obtained over the last few years, parameters affecting oil recovery performance of Lockheed disc-drum devices are investigated. Full-scale test results of the prototype High Seas Oil Recovery System (HSORS) showed very high recovery rates over a wide range of oil properties and thicknesses including thin slicks. Measured recovery rates exceeded 1,000 gal/min with less than 7 percent water pickup. The full-scale prototype tests were conducted at outdoor facilities at Battelle-Northwest and EPA's OHMSETT in calm water and waves, with and without oil, and with and without forward way. The effects of ambient temperature variations on oil properties and test conditions were carefully accounted for during data analyses. Earlier, a smaller size disc-drum device was tested to provide support and planning information for the prototype tests. Peak recovery rates were obtained for oil viscosity of approximately 200 to 1,500 centistokes. The recovery rate increased with oil layer thickness. Optimum disc rotation rate increased with relative current speeds. Relative current speeds improved the oil feeding rate and subsequently the recovery rate. Motions of the device in waves did not appear to significantly influence the recovery rate. Elevation of the recovered oil collecting trough above the water surface slightly improved the recovery rate for stationary operations. Some theoretical claims by Leibovich for a similar disc-drum device are found to be contradicted by the full-scale prototype test data, and are corrected. Disc-drum devices of different sizes have been operating successfully in harbors, ports, open seas, refineries, food processing plants, steel mills, railroad maintenance yards, and many other applications throughout the world."
"SEASAT-A has expanded the interest in remote sensing as a tool to study and monitor world oceans. The available instruments make it possible to detect waves, tides, surface temperature, wind and current boundaries. A research and calibration effort is discussed; its aim is to obtain comparisons between remote sensors and surface truth measurements. A pre-launch experiment was conducted offshore of Marineland, Florida. Another experiment is being planned for the winter of 1977. Post-launch surface truth calibration needs are discussed in preliminary form."
"The CCIW high resolution Acoustic Fish Census System is a transportable fish counting and assessment tool designed to support biological studies of fish population in Canada's inland waters. The system features an 80 kHz transducer, a transceiver with a unique precision TVG receiver, a hard-wired signal processor and data logger, a fibre optics-CRT graphic intensity display, digital data printout and digital magtape storage. The system is configured to operate from survey launches in fresh water of depths ranging from 3 to 100 m. It processes target returns in 4 echo amplitude intervals and 6 adjustable depth ranges. A bottom-tracking digital servo is incorporated to improve the security of bottom echo rejection. A brief summary of the system mathematical modelling problem is presented together with some inferred limitations on system application. Two of these systems have been constructed, and are being used by two environmental study groups."
"An energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analyser has been applied to the in-situ elemental analysis of marine and freshwater sediments. This technique allows upwards of 20 elements to be quantitatively measured to the 10 ppm level at water depths to 300 ft. The analyzer system consists of a solid cryogen-cooled Si(Li) X-ray detector with a 20 mil Be window, a 50 mCi109Cd excitation source, and an analyzer/computer system for data storage and manipulation. Details of the detector system, the actual in-situ spectra, and the recorded data with respect to the detection of pollutants at existing environmental concentrations are discussed. The system response illustrates the usefulness of the technique for rapid environmental pollutant studies and mineral exploration of the marine sedimentary materials."
"This paper will discuss the development and the beginning implementation of a plan for the instituting of marine education in the K-12 curriculum for the public and private schools of the State of Hawaii. It traces the history of marine education in the State of Hawaii showing the stages of its evolution and the developmental procedures undertaken to produce the plan and begin its implementation."
"The NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) has developed a special purpose microcomputer system for the acquisition of wave spectral data aboard some of its operational buoys. This system is an outgrowth of an earlier system used successfully aboard NDBO buoys in the Gulf of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico. The system is capable of producing, in conjunction with shore based data processing, high resolution spectra. The first deployment and operation of the system is planned for Summer of 1976. This paper will discuss the sequence of technical events leading to the design concept for the system. A preliminary analysis leading to the selected design will be discussed. A block diagram for the system will be shown. Sampling rates, durations of sampling, and other basic wave measurement parameters will be discussed. A flow chart for the microprocessor software program will be presented. Shore based data processing will be presented and described. Plans for the deployment of and acquisition of data from the system will be described."
"A prawn larvae/Juvenile separation mechanism was developed using funnel-shaped larvae valves. Several characteristics of larvae and juveniles were utilized in the design of the equipment: (1) the larvae are active swimmers while the juveniles adopt a benthic mode of life and (2) the larvae are attracted by light. Tests showed that better than 95 percent efficiency in separation can be achieved. Based on the results, a complete pilot hatchery system for prawn juvenile production is being designed."
"A deep ocean sampler capable of aseptically sampling and maintaining a seawater sample under in situ conditions of pressure and temperature has been developed. The sampler comprises two interlocking subunits. A sequenced cam-driven triggering mechanism and a spring driven pump are integrated into one of the subunits. The second subunit consists of a 400 ml teflon-coated sample chamber that can be used for continuous incubation under elevated, i.e., in situ hydrostatic pressure. Nutrients may be added and mixed without decompression of the sample. The sampler has been tested in a high pressure chamber, on cruises in shallow depths, and in the Puerto Rican Trench."
"Coastal oceanic upwelling of deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface has long been recognized as a natural phenomenon associated with levels of biological production which are orders of magnitude higher than values for the open ocean. Some current research suggests that by artificially upwelling seawater, these same high levels of biological production are possible. In 1973 the concept of artificial upwelling was applied to a small bay in southeastern Alaska, and rough biological and engineering estimates were made which revealed the possibility that this aquaculture scheme might be economically feasible. On this basis, the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska developed a research program to evaluate artificial upwelling on a small scale prototype system in Seward, Alaska. Deep water and surface water were pumped into separate earthen ponds where phytoplankton abundance, diversity and productivity were measured. Concomitant with these studies, oceanographic surveys were made of nine candidate upwelling sites in southeastern Alaska. In January of 1975 a study was conducted to assess the economic feasibility of conducting artificial upwelling aquaculture using tidal energy at one of these nine selected sites. The study began with development of primary and secondary biological production estimates based on available seawater nutrients. Twelve candidate aquaculture species were evaluated and four selected for more detailed study. Pink salmon (Onchorhynchus gorbuscha) was chosen as the best species for culture using both biological and economic criteria. Production estimates were made based on an optimum cost/benefit relationship between pipe costs to deliver seawater of varying quantity and nutrient quality, and the resultant biological productivity. An economic evaluation of this system is presented. Alternate schemes were also investigated for adding nutrients to an embayment (fish-processing wastes), and for generating power (wind energy) to create the upwelling."
"The adhesion enhancing activity of macromolecular material extracted from sea water samples taken in the Northeastern Caribbean Sea has been examined. The extracted materials were tested for their surface active properties by determining their effect on the adhesion of marine phytoplankton cells to glass. The test materials were extracted from sea water samples taken along the southwest coast of Puerto Rico, at three offshore stations; (I) northwest of the Jungfern Passage in the Virgin Island Basin; (II) (Serial Station) 20 miles directly south of the southwest coast of Puerto Rico; and (III) in the Mona Passage, west of Puerto Rico. Sampling at the offshore stations was designed to examine three discrete water masses: Caribbean Surface Water (CSW), the Subtropical Underwater (SUW) and the Subantarctic Intermediate Water (SAIW). The materials extracted from the CSW and the SUW enhanced the adhesion of the test cells to glass. The mixed layer of the SAIW did not contain adhesion active material. Adhesion enhancement activity was found in the materials obtained from samples taken at stations (I) and (II), but was not found at station (III). If this material comes from the source area of the SUW in the Northwestern Atlantic, then these data suggest that there may be a restriction in the Mona Passage to the movement of this activity."
"A controllable real-time data acquisition and monitoring system was developed for coastal oceanographic parameter measurements. This system continuously measures profiles of temperature, conductivity, current velocity and direction as a function of depth at a number of fixed off-shore locations. The data acquisition, monitoring and control system features make this system generally suitable for unattended area monitoring applications in environmental sciences. The system has been in routine operation since July 1975."
"The development of a lightweight buoy which can be used in currents up to 8 km is the design goal of this study. Associated with the fast current environment is a substantial amount of debris, ranging from mill grass to fallen trees. The buoys presently in use tend to submerge in fast currents and generally can only be recognized by the surface water disturbance. After design, testing, and evaluation of several types of fast water buoys, two sizes of spherical section buoys have been developed and are undergoing operational evaluation. Another size of spherical section buoy, almost a hemisphere, is presently being procured."
 "Presents the back cover of this proceedings volume."
 "Ocean environmental relations between the industrial North and the developing South are considered. The first issue is whether multiple environmental standards for ocean pollution abatement, less stringent for poor countries, are economically rational. Multiple standards are generally more efficient, but it does not follow that developing countries should always choose lower standards than wealthier countries. Transfrontier pollution is then defined, and two causes of globally inefficient resource allocation are analyzed: uncorrected international environmental externalities, and the failure of international negotiations to secure optimal ocean pollution abatement levels without a functioning international \"market\" for environmental rights. Finally, the concept of environmental exploitation of the poor countries by the rich countries is examined. Estimates for marine oil pollution suggest that industrial countries do indeed make disproportionate use of the oceans for waste disposal."
"The author predicts the legal/political effects of the Ocean Farm Project, the first true open sea mariculture project under development at the Naval Undersea Center in San Diego, Ca. He offers an approach to facilitate the projects utilization for the benefit of mankind. This includes an identification, analysis and evaluate of the physical and social impacts likely to result from the employment of such a technology including legal/political effects. This was done with a view toward recommending that a prior claim under international law be made before actual installation of the farm in the open ocean environment. The goal here would be the avoidance of international and domestic conflict constituting counter claims, such as those that have plagued the deep ocean mining industry."
  "The relative capabilities of two remote-sensing systems in measuring depth and, consequently, bottom contours in sandy-bottomed and sediment-laden coastal waters were determined quantitatively. The Multispectral Scanner-(MSS), orbited on the Landsat-2 Satellite, and the Ocean Color Scanner (OCS), flown on U-2 aircraft, were used for this evaluation. Analysis of imagery taken simultaneously indicates a potential for hydrographic charting of marine coastal and shallow shelf areas, even when water turbidity is a factor. Several of the eight optical channels examined on the OCS were found to be sensitive to depth or depth-related information. The greatest sensitivity was in OCS-4 (0.544 \\pm 0.012 \\mum) from which contours corresponding to depths up to 12 m were determined. The sharpness of these contours and their spatial stability through time suggests that upwelling radiance is a measure of bottom reflectance and not of water turbidity. The two visible channels on Landsat's MSS were less sensitive in the discrimination of contours, with depths up to 8 m in the high-gain mode (3 X) determined in MSS-4 (0.5 to0.6/mum)."
"The applicability of two electrical prospecting methods-controlled-source audiomagnetotellurics (AMT) and resistivity profiling with surface- and bottom-towed arrays-to underwater mineral exploration was tested in shallow waters along the north shore of Keweenaw Peninsula in Lake Superior. These methods were first used in Copper Harbor, where there are known underwater copper veins, and later applied in Great Sand Bay to determine whether offshore extensions of onshore copper veins exist. They proved successful in detecting conductivity anomalies associated with known underwater veins, lithologic boundaries, and sands with a high heavy-mineral content. Probable copper veins located along underwater projections of onshore veins were discovered in both areas. These methods hold promise in exploration for placer and vein deposits in the shallow marine environment."
"Although the optimum temperatures for divers in He-O2environments as a function of depth (pressure) has been established, survival times at nonoptimum temperatures has not been quantitatively determined. In an attempt to do so, the theoretical rates of heat loss, and estimated survival times, were calculated for temperatures of 35,45,55,65 and 75 deg. F at pressures of 400,600,800, and 1,000 fsw (feet of seawater). This was done both for unprotected divers and those with thermal protection sufficient to reduce radiative and convective heat losses by 75%. As the major contributing factor was respiratory heat loss, effective insultation by way of protective garments does not contribute significantly to survival time, especially at the higher pressures and colder temperatures. For the pressures and temperatures considered, survival times ranged from several hours to less than 10 minutes. This can have serious implications in the case of an emergency rig abandonment while divers are at pressure; where they would be set adrift in a pressurized unheated bell."
"A new Office of Marine Minerals has been established in the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The new office serves as a focal point for NOAA's new and expanding programs in marine minerals. It also has planning, coordinating and certain operational responsibilities. During the past year the new office has initiated various plans and studies. An important example in environmental assessment involves the development of a plan for a multi-phased \"Assessment of Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts of Onshore Processing Activities Associated with Deep Ocean Mining\" in response to Congressional request and concerns of others. A contract on the first phase has already been awarded. One of the major areas of involvement was in determining national needs in marine minerals. A major workshop was convened in Silver Spring, Maryland in early 1976 to review past and present NOAA activities in marine minerals including those conducted by the Marine Minerals Technology Center (MMTC) and Sea Grant and to assess future national needs. Approximately eighty persons from academia, industry, government and NOAA participated. This is the first time such a widely based marine minerals workshop was ever held. This paper will also review some of the highlights of this meeting held in Silver Spring."
"A series of remote sensing experiments, using an airborne Ocean Color Scanner (OCS), has been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting surface chlorophyll concentrations in coastal water from high altitude. Upwelling radiance from the sea surface was recorded by 10 narrow bandwidth wavelength channels of the OCS, at an altitude of 19.8 km Measurements were made over areas with vastly different biological activities. A strong correlation between the OCS radiance measurements and the surface chlorophyll measurements was found. The extracted chlorophyll signature agreed qualitatively with results from low altitude observations, except in the blue region. In addition, it was found that a simple algorithm could be used to estimate reliable chlorophyll distributions from OCS measurements."
"A preliminary study of a unique approach to the determination of the structure of a medium from noisy normal-incidence acoustic reflection data is carried out. This approach employs a simple equal travel-time layer model for the medium, implemented by a state variable formalism. Structure determination is achieved by maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters which define the system model, the reflection coefficients. The Cramer-Rao bound on estimation accuracy is derived for the model, and computed for two cases of practical interest. It is shown that physically significant conclusions may be drawn from the behavior of the bound. Monte Carlo tests are used to compare the noise sensitivity of this estimator with that of another estimator, which is based on the Wiener-Hopf integral equation. This latter estimator, although exact in the absence of noise, is found to be unstable when noise is present."
"The Seabed Assessment Program of the Offices for the International Decade of Ocean Exploration, U. S. National Science Foundation has sponsored an inter-university project of research on marine manganese nodules since 1972. The project is studying the origin of manganese nodules and attempting to discern what processes lead to ore grade concentrations of minor metals within them. Significant progress has been made in understanding mineralogy, growth rates, sediment age, mode of formation, sediment interstitial fluid compositions, the role of organisms and the seafloor setting in which nodules are found. Future research in the project will be more process oriented than it has been in the past."
"By utilizing characteristic interaction processes of nuclear radiation with matter along with automatic data acquisition and reduction, nuclear measuring techniques may successfully be applied for solving various analytical instrumentation problems in mining and processing of manganese nodules. Development work performed at the Geesthacht research centre demonstrates that gamma-ray transmission spectrometry allows a reliable quasi-continuous and non-destructive determination of both the nodule drift velocity and the space concentrations of nodules, sediment and water in a conveyer flow. Such data are representative of the efficiency of collector or hydraulic lift systems and are of considerable importance in economy deliberations. Measuring devices have been designed which may be attached to a conveyer pipe in the deep-sea. For elemental analyses of manganese nodules a rapid nuclear method based on fast-neutron activation techniques has been developed that allows determinations of the most relevant metals without sample treatment, thus being particularly suited for quasicontinuous applications."
"A very extensive vane shear testing program of sediments from potential manganese nodule mining areas was conducted in 1975 during Leg III of NOAA's DOMES program. This effort was performed in conjunction with planned USGS studies. Replicate vane shear tests were made on 51 large box cores recovered from the three DOMES study sites A, B, and C. The statistically designed coring program (nested type), combined with efforts to sample major topographical features provided an ideal opportunity to more accurately assess the strength characteristics of nodule area sediments, including the macro- and micro- variability of this parameter. Test results demonstrated that the original vane shear strengths for the majority of cores tested from all three sites agree very closely. Average original strength profiles for each site increase from approximately 0.5 to 1.0 psi in the first 3-6 inches of sediment depth, thereafter values remain nearly constant or increase to about 1.4 psi in the rest of the depths examined. Average sensitivity values (ratios of original to remolded strength) however, were higher for Site C than Sites A and B. Analysis of the vane shear strength lateral variability showed that the largest percent of the variability is contributed by differences between cores from the same station, and the next largest percent by differences between tests conducted in the same core. At all test depths, strength differences between different stations and different sites were found to be less significant. These results clearly indicate the need for more detailed sediment sampling within relatively small seafloor areas."
"Thirteen short cores raised from water depths of 4.2 to 4.5 km in the Deepsea Ventures, Inc., mining claim area during Phase 1 of the NOAA Deep Ocean Mining Environmental Study (DOMES) were geotechnically analyzed at Lehigh University in 1975-76. The sediments are predominantly fine-grained, cohesive siliceous pelagic clays having average specific gravities of about 2.3. Selected geotechnical properties, measured and averaged over the 188 to 438 mm length of the cores, are: bulk density, 1.32 Mg/m3; water contents 178% dry weight; liquid limit, 137%; plastic limit, 82%; vane shear strength, 5 kPa; and sensitivity, 3.6. Reported shear strength and sensitivity values may be slightly lower because of sample disturbance. The data reported in this investigation are similar in magnitude to data for pelagic clay and siliceous ooze previously reported in the literature."
"The introduction of 200 mile zones will offer a new potential for proper management of the common-property fishery resources that lie off our coasts. One of the basic difficulties with studying the northwest Atlantic area is the biological and technological interrelationships between the different fisheries. A production model has been built taking these externalities into account. Using these interrelated production functions with data on the relative cost of effort in the different fisheries it is possible to describe that combination of effort that will achieve maximum economic yield for the fishery. The model will not only be able to correct for the common property problem but also for the biological and technological externalities that exist between the fisheries. Also measures will be provided of the losses in terms of efficiency that will occur when other goals of management such as maintaining local employment or correcting balance of payment problems are used."
  "A great deal of attention has recently been given to the effects of various tax policies on energy production. However, of the many publicly available studies none have addressed the dynamic interaction effects of percentage royalty taxation and the various types (cost and percentage) of depletion allowances which generally prevailed on natural resources prior to recent legislation. Though the depletion allowance resulted in greater resource production at any given price, percentage royalty taxation has the opposite effect. For efficiency in production both tax rates, i.e. the royalty and depletion, should be equal. This paper analyzes the joint effects of royalty taxation and the two types of depletion allowances in the context of a dynamic model using as a pardigm hydrocarbon exploitation on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Although this specificity allows for concreteness of examples, it does not limit the generality of the analysis. It appears that the Congress' recent removal of the percentage depletion allowance on oil was a serious mistake unless, of course, the interest of the legislation was to distort production or raise prices."
  "In recent years units of the Navy's operational command dedicated to deep submergence, Submarine Development Group ONE, have established an ever increasing record of productive accomplishments in the deep ocean. This paper highlights on-going development of the deep submergence vehicles SEA CLIFF (DSV 4) and TURTLE (DSV 3) which deploy regularly to conduct operations for various mission sponsors such as the Office of Naval Research, Pacific Missile Test Center and the Naval Research Laboratory. During this period these vehicles have undergone a development to improve their deep ocean capabilities and systems' reliability. The result has been that each subsequent deployment has produced precedent setting records for deep submergence vehicles in terms of operations and tangible results. The paper concludes with projected plans to extend SEA CLIFF/TURTLE depth capabilities to 20,000 feet."
"As part of development of a general-purpose, towed-vehicle system, a \"Batfish\" body has been expanded, tow tested and the system mathematically modelled for predictability. As a demonstration of the capability of the system, a pumped sampling system was installed and flown in the vehicle utilizing a novel high pressure pump that delivered 9 litres per minute through the faired cable. On-board sensors monitored depth and vehicle status as the body undulated between the surface and 55 m with a 0.7 km cycle at 10 kts. towing speed."
"A small computer controlled submarine capable of carrying out various underwater tasks has been designed and built. The vehicle continues to be developed and improved. It has operated for many hours under computer control and has made test runs where oceanographic data have been measured, stored, and eventually printed out. The vehicle is approximately 2.3 m long, .37 m diameter, and weighs 110 kg, in air."
"Ocean-cable burial systems (sea plows) developed by Bell Laboratories have been used with considerable success during the past eight years to provide cable protection from trawler damage over the 100-odd miles of continental shelf on both sides of the Atlantic. These systems, however, were not designed to achieve positive burial of repeaters (amplifiers) and their adjacent cable, or to operate beyond 300 fathoms. A newly developed SG cable system, schedule for TAT-6, will have 1 1/2 times the channel capacity of all present transatlantic cables combined, meaning significantly higher cost of providing interim service in the event of a trawler break. To provide the cable protection required for TAT-6 both in terms of burial performance and operating-depth capability, SEA PLOW IV was designed and tested over a 18-month period beginning in January, 1974 and was successfully used to bury both shore ends of TAT-6 during August and October, 1975."
"LEO I is one of the newest submersibles produced by International Hydrodynamics Company Ltd. While still maintaining the wide range of capabilities which have made the PISCES submersibles so successful, LEO I has been designed with reliability and safety as primary concerns. Many of LEO's reliability and safety features have been developed from over ten years of operations of the PISCES line of submersibles. Several new safety features are also included, such as; reduced floodable volume which eliminates the possibility of the submersible sinking if anything other than the personnel sphere floods; a highly reliable lead ballast system was developed; the pilot's field of vision was increased through the use of a large spherical sector viewport."
"The objective of this study was to develop an approximate method for predicting, with acceptable accuracy, the electromagnetic field scattered by perfectly conducting bodies of complex shape immersed in a lossy medium, i.e. the ocean, when subjected to the field of an oscillating magnetic dipole source."
"The spectacular growth of Hawaii's coastal zone has resulted in a disquieting array of use conflicts in recent years. This situation is further compounded by an oligopolistic pattern of shoreline ownership. The conflicts center primarily on massive resort development by private developers and coastal water pollution due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. The most frequent conflicts have been between private resort developers and local residents, the central issue being public access. Visual pollution, water pollution and air pollution are also dominant elements in the conflict rubric. This study shows that an effective technique to identify use conflicts involves the use of \"compatibility matrixes.\" These matrixes enable planners to determine the degree of compatibility of a proposed or planned use with one or several existing uses and thus avoid potential use conflicts and consequent waste of precious resources."
"A variety of signal processing techniques are available which can assist the interpretation of side-scan sonar. In exploring the range of possibilities for processing with these techniques we have developed selective tuning of textural enhancement for different textural wavelengths. In practice we have found it desirable to be free to decide on tuning, or whether to use textural enhancement at all, based on tests simulating the survey conditions as faithfully as possible. Test targets 1-2 meters long were recorded well on three alternative recordings, but were more readily identifiable when fine and grose bottom textures were suppressed by an intermediate selection of textural enhancement. If the bottom texture had been of interest, a different choice would have been made."
"A semi-automatic, electronic system used to measure seismic reflectivity of the water-bottom sediment is devised. The central part of the system is an apparatus designed to negate waveform spherical divergence using a linear ramp function coupled with a voltage multiplier circuit. A time gating circuit allows any part of the multiplier output to be amplified and preserved on a unique galvanometer camera record. Using a 3.5 kilohertz acoustic signal, Eastern Block Island Sound is mapped for reflectivity. A regression equation is established between reflection amplitude and water-bottom sediment mean grain size. A water-bottom, Wentworth sediment classification map is thereby obtained. Application of this method would include optimum offshore pipeline routing, platform location, and mineral exploration."
"A dual-beam sonar system has been developed for making in situ measurements of the target strength of individual fish. Estimates of fish target strength distribution obtained with this system are superior to estimates obtained using other techniques. The estimates of the mean value and distribution of fish target strengths obtained with the system are used in conjunction with other acoustic techniques for assessment of fish populations. This paper gives an overall description of the system and a more detailed discussion of some of the innovative hardware and software aspects of the system's development."
 "The MAFLA study is currently entering into its third year of the BLM-OCS program. The initial program, conducted in May-July, 1974, established benchmark values for a wide variety of chemical, biological, geological and selected physical parameters in the lease tract areas. The southern zone is a pristine area with low trace metal and hydrocarbon concentrations in the water, sediment, biota, a carbonate type of geology and a wide infaunal diversity. The northern area is strongly influenced by the Mississippi River system. Chemical parameters (trace metals and hydrocarbons) are higher and more variable in concentration, the sediments are dominated by the presence of silts and clays, and the biota, while still abundant, is less diverse."
"An extensive study of the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf area off the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia was initiated by the Bureau of Land Management, U. S. Department of Interior, during 1975. Major components of the program are being conducted by other federal agencies particularly the U. S. Geological Survey and the Environmental Data Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The benchmark or baseline portion of the study is being conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. The benchmark studies include extensive hydrocarbon and trace metal analyses of sediments, benthos, zooplankton, neuston and suspended particulates. In addition, studies of the benthic biota including community dynamics and histopathological condition and bacterial populations are included. Supportive physical, chemical and geological information is collected in the study."
"An anodized aluminum, completely vented box-core and an aluminum vented Van Veen grab sampler were successfully used to collect 145 quantitative, uncontaminated and minimally disturbed benthic sediment samples. Sediments collected with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Box Corer and Van Veen Sampler contact either aluminum or teflon. Replicable, non-contaminating subsampling procedures are described. The samplers allow the collection of sediments with minimal structural alterations, uncontaminated with trace metals or hydrocarbons."
 "Overall objectives of the South Texas Outer Continental Shelf (STOCS) study are put forth and the sampling design discussed. The limits of the study area are defined and the parameters to be sampled and analyzed are identified. The work is described as a multidisciplinary, team research effort between principal investigators at the University of Texas Marine Science Laboratory, Texas A&M University and Rice University. The University researchers cooperate with other investigators, working on the STOCS, from the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Marine Fisheries Service."
"The Applied Physics Laboratory has recently completed a series of underwater temperature measurements using a new thermistor chain developed in collaboration with Fathom Oceanology, Ltd., and Sippican Corporation. The chain is a 750 ft long cable with plastic nose and tail fairings to reduce the cable drag coefficient to less than 0.20. Thirty thermistors in glass envelopes are mounted in the nose pieces and exposed to the free stream. Response time constant in sea water when towed at 4 kts is 180 msec. Tests in January 1976 off the west coast of St. Croix have confirmed the reliability of the chain. The desired accuracy of\\pm0.01deg Celsius has been obtained. Each thermistor is serviced by a pair of twisted #30 insulated wires which are carried in the tail fairings. A total of 77 pairs of wires was provided in two bundles, and there is space for an additional 36 pairs. The end of the cable is weighted with an 850 lb faired body which contains a pressure transducer and acoustical devices for tracking."
"Conductivity, temperature and pressure profiling instruments usually being fitted with the best of available sensors, differences of readings with laboratory tests or intercalibration in sufficiently homogeneous water are merely a question of calibration, not of quality. Even in areas of very homogeneous deep water one finds random deviations of water properties much larger than the tolerance of measuring and calculation, and larger with the primary readingsC,TandPthan with the secondary ones\\deltaand S. These deviations give rise to additional large errors in the secondary readings, caused by the different transient responses of the sensors, and by the way to get the primary readings from the output of the sensors. By computer simulation it was found, that0.01\\degC random deviation and a certain thermometer cause0.8\\cdotp10^{-5}ruggedness of\\deltawith a sampling system. With an averaging system the value is0.5\\cdotp10^{-5}and can easily be reduced to0.25\\cdotp10^{-5}."
"Instrumented drogues were used to measure temperature as a function of time and position in the thermal plume from a power plant. During a two week period in June, 1975, 92 temperature recording drogues were deployed in the heated water discharge from the Pilgrim Power Station located near Plymouth, Massachusetts. Results of the measurements indicate a rapidly varying near-field temperature distribution which varied primarily as a function of winds and tides and the currents associated with them. The tracks followed by individual drogues were highly variable and showed no discernible concentration in any particular area. Plots of temperature versus time and temperature versus distance show that most of the data fall into well defined envelopes which delineate a range of dispersion rates at the site. Comparison of the drogue data with mathematical modeling results obtained by Adams, et. al. (1975) illustrates their usefulness in model verification and calibration."
"During the last six years the Marine Physical Laboratory has been engaged in a study of the internal wavefield in the upper ocean. Inasmuch as internal waves propagate horizontally, vertically, and in time, a four-dimensional (space-time) measurement was desired. To meet these requirements, a three-element temperature sensor system in an array 40 meters on a side, was created by mounting 3 booms on the R/P FLIP. Repeated temperature profiles were made from each of these booms. The system consists of temperature and depth profile sensors, winches to raise and lower the sensors, a computer to manage the data, and a central control unit. A vibrotron pressure sensor and two variable frequency thermometers are suspended from each of the booms. The first thermometer and the pressure sensor are placed at the bottom end of a 500 meter cable; a second thermometer is attached 188 meters up the cable. The cables are raised and lowered simultaneously by individual winches. Lowering the winch cable 220 meters provides sampling over a depth of 400 meters in the water column. The drop rate of the sensors is 4.5 meters/second. Vertical temperature resolution is 1 meter. Profiles are taken every two minutes by the three elements. The sensors are scanned by the computer while the elements descend. While the elements are being raised the computer is utilized for data display and initial analysis."
 "The Digital Decompression Computer (DECOMETER) is a wrist-worn accessory that enables the diver to maximize his time in the water safely and reliably. The computer is programmed with the U. S. Navy Diving Tables and continually calculates his inert gas pressure at each depth to determine his decompression status. The calculations occur every two seconds and the diver's status is displayed as actual depth and safe ascent depth; for safety, the battery status is also indicated. The significant features which make the device unique are its small size, digital microprocessor, programmability, low power consumption, and, of course, its ability to accompany the diver. The DECOMETER's main purpose is to compute and display the diver's decompression status as a guide. It is not, in itself, a life support item."
"The Aanderaa current meter is widely used with a variety of platforms in different oceanographic and limnologic environments. It was not intended to be used in regions where surface wave motions would influence the measurements. Several examples are described to show the effect of surface waves upon Aanderaa current measurements made near the surface and near the bottom in shallow-water environments."
"This paper describes the existing and impending movement of large quantities of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) through the ports of this country. The role of the U. S. Coast Guard, the primary Federal Agency responsible for maritime safety and law enforcement, is outlined in relation to this movement and attendant storage of LNG in our port areas. The existing, building, and planned LNG terminals and trade routes are discussed along with a brief description of the LNG carrier. The hazards of LNG are sketched and the research to quantify these hazards which has been completed, in progress, or planned is described. The controls which will be placed on the operation of the LNG carriers will be briefly considered. A scenario of the worst credible accident is presented and weighed against the need for the LNG as an energy source."
"A three-dimensional computer model to simulate the dynamic responses of small guyed towers, loaded with scientific equipment, to wind and wave forces has been developed to aid the tower designer. The wave forces for any combination of waveheight and wavelength were calculated from linear wave theory and applied to a NASTRAN package program. This model is unique in that it calculates the natural frequencies, displacements, forces and accelerations of the structure under the effects of the non-linear behaviour of guy cables acting simultaneously with the wave forces. Three types of guyed towers used in the Great Lakes were analysed using this technique. Guy wire tensions were measured under actual wind and wave conditions in Lake Ontario on two of the tower configurations. The recorded data, compared with the responses predicted by the model, provide some valuable insight into the behaviour of guyed instrument towers."
"In early 1977, the French Engineering firm SERETE will deliver a new type of geological and geophysical survey vessel to the U.S.S.R. This 2,000 ton ship is designed to operate in water depth of 600 meters, due to the use of a dynamic anchoring system. It is equipped with a conventional rotary drilling installation, and a flexodrilling device in which the rigid drill pipes are replaced by a continuous hose stored on a drum. In addition to a saving of manoeuvering time, this method allows the pursuit of drilling operations despite a heavy swell in difficult sea conditions."
"A rational procedure for the dimensioning of subsea pipelines is described. It consists of a computer program which determines pipe diameter and wall thickness for given quantities of flow rate, depth of water, bottom current velocity and towing capacity of the lay barge. Steel quality, out-of-roundnees of pipe and characteristics of the concrete coating are also taken into account. The paper explains in detail the bending/ buckling criteria used in determining the steel pipe wall thickness. An analytical expression is derived for the maximum combined stress of a pipe subjected to constant external pressure and an external bending moment, allowing for initial cut-of-roundness. The concrete coating dimensions are determined in such a way that sufficient negative buoyancy of the air-filled pipe in water is maintained to counteract the lift originating from bottom currents. The bending moment is calculated with the help of large-deflection beam theory, solving the non-linear differential equation by means of finite-beam-element techniques. Sample applications of the design technique are given and checked against model tests and full scale data."
"In this paper the limitations of present underwater tools and methods of accomplishing work is discussed and the need for a better system is presented.

Predictions are made of the role which this source of energy will play in the new world of underwater technology, as related to the Offshore Oil Industry."
"The single-hose two-stage demand regulator is the most common means of supplying divers with gas.

"Under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, the U. S. Coast Guard is charged with the responsibility to conduct surveillance of ocean dumping activities. In the past, several methods of surveillance have been used by the Coast Guard which have met with varying degrees of success. The Coast Guard's Office of Research and Development has developed an electronic surveillance system which will be required equipment on all vessels engaged in ocean dumping activities. This system uses Loran-C to determine the vessel's position, a dump sensor which interlocks the dump controls or mechanisms, a real time clock and various other data which is internally generated and can be used for data analysis. All of the required data will be recorded on digital cassette tape on board the dumping vessel. The Coast Guard will collect the recorded data tapes and through analysis determine where, when and at that rate the dumping occurred."
 "The indigenous hydrocarbons in samples of zooplankton, shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) and sediment are extracted by refluxing with a series of organic solvents fractionated by column chromatography and then resolved by high resolution gas chromatography. The above fractions were then spiked with the aliphatic or aromatic components isolated from a Louisiana crude oil and rechromatographed. Identification of resolved hydrocarbons is achieved by use of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer combination. Capillary columns enable almost complete resolution of all the isoprenoid, branched and cyclic alkanes that are important in determining the presence of petroleum in a marine sample. Many of the key petroleum aromatic compounds could also be resolved by use of capillary columns from many of the naturally occurring esters, alkenes and related organics. The greater the reliance on gas chromatography as the principle tool to establish the presence of trace petroleum pollution in marine samples, the greater the need to employ high resolution chromatography."
"The continuing loss of life in the diving fraternity in the North Sea has resulted in the United Kingdom placing particular emphasis on safe diving.

"The Marine Technology Society Undersea Vehicle Safety Standards Subcommittee is working on the third book in its submersible safety series. This book \"Recommended Safety Standards for the Operation of Undersea Vehicles\" is to be written by working groups formed from submersible designers, builders and operators. The approach used to formulate the working groups, the expected content of the book and the progress to date is discussed."
"Recent reconnaissance aircraft, satellite, and radar data have been analyzed to show where typhoons occur and how they behave. Nineteen tropical cyclones reach full typhoon strength per year, on the average. Five of these can be expected to reach super typhoon strength, that is, to have maximum sustained winds of 130 knots, or higher. The potential threat of these storms should not be underestimated by those planning marine activities in the western North Pacific. The average death toll for the past 22 years has been 1,418 fatalities per year."
"Winds, currents, and wave heights have been recorded for several years near the New Jersey coast. These data sets permit statistical examination of wind-current and wind-wave height relationships. Determination of statistically significant relationships permits the use of existing wind data to extend the representativeness of observed time series. Observed wave heights and currents are sorted into groups corresponding to different, suitably averaged, prevailing winds. Bivariate wave height/wind speed histograms and summary statistics are determined for eight classes of wind direction. Polar coordinate scatter plots and rms distribution ellipses of current observations corresponding to each wind category are displayed. Such distributions provide usable, empirical predictive capability. Wave height distributions show that onshore wind speeds greater than 14 m/s always resulted in significant wave heights greater than 2.1 m. Offshore and downcoast winds exceeding 5 m/sec are responsible for almost all currents exceeding 30 cm/sec."
"SCARAB is an unmanned cable-controlled submersible currently under construction whose mission is to aid in the repair and maintenance of undersea telephone cables. One of SCARAB's cable-locating techniques involves a magnetometer array to detect the magnetic field of a low-frequency current carried by the cable. The magnetometer signals are filtered, amplified, digitized, and multiplexed onto SCARAB's control cable for transmission to the control ship. A ship-borne minicomputer processes these signals in real time to determine the cable location, which is continuously displayed to SCARAB's operator on a graphics terminal. The computer algorithm for cable localization is briefly described, as are the numerical simulations and field experiments carried out to predict the performance of the system."
"The majority of the manned underwater vehicles in use at the present time for commercial and scientific purposes are usually equipped with instruments which are standard equipment for the contemporary submersible. Such equipment includes navigation and communication systems, video and photo equipment, manipulators, underwater lights and others. But scientific submersibles should be equipped with special instrumentation. This specific combination of instruments depends on the specific scientific purposes for which the vehicles will be used. At the present time submersibles are used mostly in some narrow fields of the oceanographic research and therefore are equipped with corresponding instruments as required. Such a narrow specialization is connected with small space facility within the submersibles and correspondingly small space for instrumentation. Only a small part of contemporary submersibles can be used for the conducting of complex oceanographic research. This report describes the instrument suite of the PISCES type submersible owned by the Institute of Oceanology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. The scientific equipment consists of sensors for measurement of temperature, conductivity of seawater, depth, speed of current in three coordinates, sound velocity in water, oxygen dissolved in water, transducers for side scan sonar, and sub-bottom profiler. The signals from all sensors enter the inputs of the data acquisition system that has 24 input channels: 16 analog and 8 digital. The information from the output of the data acquisition system is recorded on video tape in digital form in conjunction with the signal from underwater TV cameras. The control for the data is made on the screen of the TV monitor during the measurements. The processing of information from the video tape is made on support ships with a 21 MX Hewlett Packard computer. The submersible has an acoustic navigation system that pemits calculation of the position of the vehicles relative to three bottom transponders. One of the improvements of the system is the possibility for the pilot to see the position of the submersible relative to three bottom transponders on a CRT- display during an operation. The instrument suite described above is installed on two PISCES submersibles. The first experimental results of scientific investigations of this equipment will be reported at the conference."
"Data on the development, testing, support aspects, and use of four major Soviet DRV's are reviewed. Information on submersible mishaps and other vehicle and support ship related problems is reported. Based on available information, the Soviet Union is showing increasing interest in the development of DRV's, and there is a visible effort on the part of developers to upgrade DRV development priorities to a small-lot production basis. There is also evidence of interest on the part of Soviet DRV developers to eventually enter the international DRV marketplace, given a more positive attitude by the government."
"As exploratory drilling and production progresses into greater water depths, it has become apparent that cost-effective subsea monitoring and maintenance systems must be devised. The unmanned, remotely-operated vehicle described herein represents a solution to many daily operational tasks. This paper describes in detail the design features of each major subsystem, including the operational rationale behind the feature. This vehicle, designated the RECON II, is a highly mobile, remote-controlled submersible vehicle capable of being deployed from a surface vessel with a minimum of set-up time. In addition to all necessary propulsion, buoyancy, video and instrumentation systems, the vehicle incorporates an onboard hydraulic system and manipulator system with interchangeable tools to accomplish a wide range of tasks."
"The Swedish submarine rescue vehicle, URF, is presently being built. The author who is the Royal Swedish Navy Technical Project Manager has participated in and is responsible for the final design of the vehicle. The design work has been a teamwork between the Navy, the main contractor, Kockum Shipyard, Sweden and the principal subcontractor, COMEX, France. In this paper are presented design features selected because they are new or interesting or simply because they are significant for the vehicle in its previewed role. URF is a lock-out, rescue submarine with a weight of 52 tons, a load capacity of 2 tons and a multipurpose potential. It costs less than 4 million US dollars."
"This paper describes a method of undersea wireless communication by electric current. The most difficult problem about this method is how to reduce output power. In this study it was found out that effective range is not a function of power but that of current. Based on this property and the experimental results, two technically feasible models of voice communication system, one for divers which has 150 m range with 6 w power and the other for manned submersibles which has 1000 m range with 280 w power have been designed and are under development. As electric noise in the sea is extremely low, stable undersea communication is possible by this method in spite of rather high power and attenuation, compared to the acoustic method."
"The presence of ice for nine to ten months each year over the continental shelves in the Arctic requires new methods and technology in environmental assessment programs. As part of the BLM/NOAA Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessment Program in Alaska, biological and physical research is now carried out routinely throughout the year, by landing helicopters on the pack ice and lowering equipment through holes cut in the ice. Moored current meters have been designed for use under perennial ice, from which data can be transmitted acoustically on command. A number of ice buoys have been developed which are routinely interrogated by the Nimbus-6 satellite. These and other new developments have made it possible to conduct research in the coastal arctic marine environment year round; in the past, practically all existing environmental data were taken there during the brief summer only."
"A deep ocean current measurement system is being developed to meet the present and future environmental data requirements for ocean engineering design and construction. This development is being supported by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the Naval Oceanographic Office, and the Director of Navy Laboratories. The specific system goal is for 95% probability of full data recovery after one-year implant. The speed accuracy will range from\\pm 0.1cm/sec at the threshold of 0.1 cm/sec to\\pm 1cm/sec at 51 cm/sec; from 50 cm/sec to 150 cm/sec the accuracy will be\\pm 8%. The direction accuracy will be\\pm 5\\degmagnetic from 0 to360\\deg. The sensor will also measure water temperature to\\pm 0.05\\degC. The system will be a single-point mooring with a predeployment packaging configuration of a Mark 45 torpedo. The system will be deployed and recovered by aircraft with an implant duration of one year in 6100 m of water. The in-line current sensor exploits the principles of hot film anemometry for measurement of both current speed and direction. The problem of contamination is addressed by a combination of antifouling coating, sonic cleaning, and in-situ calibration. Although this paper describes the entire system, it emphasizes both theoretical and experimental work with the sensor. To date, all developmental efforts have been in the sensor area and sensor-related areas."
"Theory is presented describing deviations from linearity and cosine response for cylindrical and spherical sensors. It shows sensor sensitivity varies with boundary layer thickness for sensors with flush electrodes as well as with electrodes protruding beyond the boundary layer. We calculate values of the boundary layer coefficientC_{B}. Deviations from linearity and cosine response are proportional toC_{B}R^{-1/2}whereRis Reynolds number. We show experimental data for sensors having negative, zero, and positiveC_{B}. A nearby flow boundary degenerates sensor sensitivity. Degeneration is neutralized by a conductive boundary; it is doubled by an insulating boundary; it is nominal with water-like boundary conductivity (as in a submerged jet). A sensor appended to a subsurface housing has tilt errors owing to circulation about the housing."
 "The observation and measurement of environmental processes is made simple and economical using a minicomputer based system which controls activities and logs data from a remote unattended platform by 20 000 baud, digital, cable telemetry. The remote station electronics is bus oriented and provides A/D and D/A conversion, logical input/output and servo motor control. The minicomputer, an Interdata 74 with only 16K-byte core, houses a novel, real time, multi-tasking operating system featuring an interpretive language called REMCODE. One version of this system operates a submersible water quality analyzer which connects, via the dialed telephone network, to a central computer for real time data retrieval and remote reprogramming. Another version samples 48 analog plus 6 digital inputs at rates up to 20 Hz, from a tower in Lake Ontario and logs them onto computer-compatible magnetic tape."
 "The Coastal Zone Management Act Amendments of 1976 greatly expand the 1972 Act. This paper briefly discusses each element of those amendments and their implication for coastal states and local governments as well as the private sector. Since no regulations have yet been developed for those amendments, opportunity for input through the Federal Register review process will be available to both public and private interests."
"Urban populations are generating intense pressures for the utilization of coastal resources. Coastal management programs must be concerned with expanding the opportunities for use of the coastal zone as well as with the protection of the natural environment. One way to respond to social and economic demands for coastal resources is to increase the carrying capacity of the coastal zone in urban areas. This paper analyzes public ownership and leasing, which is a management tool that allows private development to occur within a framework of public control. Marina del Rey, the world's largest small craft harbor, is a multi-activity coastal community created through such a leasehold system, which serves a diversity of uses within one overall project. If efforts to protect natural coastal areas are to succeed, it will be necessary to determine ways to accommodate pressures for coastal activities through the development and redevelopment of the urban coastal zone."

"DEVELOPMENT SAMPLES of a 1024-bit bipolar ECI, RAM have shown typical address access time of 15 ns at 400 mW dissipation. This access time is faster than the previously rcported 1K RAM access time of 25 ns'.

"CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS has been achieved in the fabrication of low-noise microwave GaAs FETs using high quality epitaxial layers. Ion implantation has been used previously to fabricate the FET channel, but some doubt as to the possibility of obtaining low noise operation has remained. Annealling to activate the implant was accomplished with a silicon dioxide capping layer. Electron concentrations in the implanted layers varied less than 30% from end to end of the boule and across the 8 cm-2 area wafers. Typical mobilities were 4200 cm2/V-sec. Gate geometry is a straight 1 p m by 300 pm stripe divided in four equal fingers by two gate pads. The ohmic contacts were Au-Ge/Ni and the gate was Al. As a result of close control of the contact masking process and the excellent uniformity of the implanted layer, high yield was obtained."

"Summary form only given. Since the 70s, a large number of semiconductor memory devices have become available. In the early days, a limited number of different devices were available so the choice of which part to use was relatively simple. Today, however, the memory engineer is confronted with an overwhelming plethora of different parts made using many different processes. The claims from the proponents of different technologies often conflict with each other so that it is not clear which part will be the best for an application. The parts available generally fall into four board categories: (7)-dynamic MOS, (2) static MOS, (3) static bipolar, and (4) 12L. MOS memory has become well established with many available suppliers. Several different 4K dynamic types are currently available and at least one 16K device is on the verge of being announced. In the static MOS area, 1K parts are readily available, and several 4K parts are starting to become available. Bipolar memory has lagged behind with 1 K parts just barely established and available from multiple sources. To date, no I2L memories have been announced, but probably several will be during 1976. Two panelists, representing both mini computers and large general-purpose computers, will give their views on where the various memory forms fit into the present and future needs of the computer systems.

"Low-cost digital signal processing is displacing conventional analog approaches in many system applications. The impact of this trend on analog integrating circuit design will be assessed."
"Microprocessors have created a revolution in the application of digital electronics. Although they are viewed within the industry as small-scale computers, to the user the microprocessor system affords a universal programmable component for many control and information-handling applications.

"SINCE ISSCC speakers first addressed the subject ten years ago, LSI has become a reality with a broad impact across the world. Industries, here and abroad, have developed, on somewhat different time scales, with rather different emphasis and strengths . . . The Asian and particularly the European IC industry, owe much to consumer electronics influence, whereas the American IC industry is characterized by emphasis on data processing and transmission. Until the appearance of LSI, much of the development of electronic techniques, both in electronic and other industries, were based on the flexibility with which a relatively small variety of components could be arranged in many forms to achieve an almost unlimited number of functions. With the advent of LSI, enormous scale and weight reductions became possible, leading to increased reliability, but to a large extent, the design flexibility which characterized old-time electronics was in danger of being lost. The custom LSI approach, as it emerges among many European manufacturers, is a method of recovering circuit design flexibility, while taking full advantage of the other capabilities of LSI and retaining the economies associated with large-scale fabrication . . . The American industry, on the other hand, is somewhat more characterized by emphasis on standard LSI parts, especially in memories and microprocessors. Specific application of this type of LSI technology requires a definition of software and ROM firmware, and, in addition, structuring of an application interface. The new mix of designer skills required has strong professional implications, especially in the continuing technical education area, as reflected in the impact of LSI and microprocessors on the career developments of engineers . . . These evolving relationships forecast new trends in schooling, and technology research, development and applications."

"Integrated solid-state circuits have gained much ground since they were first introduced. This gain has come about in at least three distinct fashions: 1) Standard (sometimes even off the shelf) low-or medium-scale integrated circuits enter electronic equipment in much the same way as the discrete components in earlier designs; 2)Programmable integrated circuit chips are one successful answer to the problem of regaining flexibility in the case of logic circuits. The microprocessor is the main example of this type of integrated circuit; and 3)the other answer to the same problem is the customer designed IC (CDIC)."

  "Two new design methods for infinite-duration impulse-response (IIR) multirate digital filters are introduced, and a state-variable implementation is given. One method is an extension of the impulse-invariant method and results in the direct synthesis of a multi-rate filter which realizes in discrete time the response of a continuous time circuit. The second method employs linear programming (LP) to optimize the frequency domain response. For finite-length impulse response (FIR) multirate filters an efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is presented."

If a one-dimensional vector A is fractured into a two-dimensional matrix B, a one-dimensional GFT on A and a two-dimensional GFT on B give the same result and require the same number of operations to be computed. The result holds also for the DFT, as it is a particular case of the GFT."
"A high-quality pitch detector has been built in digital hard-ware and operates in real time at a 10 kHz sampling rate. The hardware is capable of providing energy as well as pitch-period estimates. The pitch and energy computations are performed 100 times/s (i.e., once per 10 ms interval). The algorithm to estimate the pitch period uses center clipping, infinite peak clipping, and a simplified autocorrelation analysis. The analysis is performed on a 300 sample section of speech which is both center clipped and infinite peak clipped, yielding a three-level speech signal where the levels are -1, 0, and +1 depending on the relation of the original speech sample to the clipping threshold. Thus computation of the autocorrelation function of the clipped speech is easily implemented in digital hardware using simple combinatorial logic, i.e., an up-down counter can be used to compute each correlation point. The pitch detector has been interfaced to the NOVA computer facility of the Acoustics Research Department at Bell Laboratories."
"The use of singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques in digital image processing is of considerable interest for those facilities with large computing power and stringent imaging requirements. The SVD methods are useful for image as well as quite general point spread function (impulse response) representations. The methods represent simple extensions of the theory of linear filtering. Image enhancement examples will be developed illustrating these principles. The most interesting cases of image restoration are those which involve space variant imaging systems. The SVD, combined with pseudoinverse techniques, provides insight into these types of restorations. Illustrations of large scale N2× N2point spread function matrix representations are discussed along with separable space variant N2× N2point spread function matrix examples. Finally, analysis and methods for obtaining a pseudoinverse of separable space variant point spread functions (SVPSF's) are presented with a variety of object and imaging system dagradations."
"Three methods of extracting resonance information from predictor-coefficient coded speech are compared. The methods are finding roots of the polynomial in the denominator of the transfer function using Newton iteration, picking peaks in the spectrum of the transfer function, and picking peaks in the negative of the second derivative of the spectrum. A relationship was found between the bandwidth of a resonance and the magnitude of the second derivative peak. Data, accumulated from a total of about two minutes of running speech from both female and male talkers, are presented illustrating the relative effectiveness of each method in locating resonances. The second-derivative method was shown to locate about 98 percent of the significant resonances while the simple peak-picking method located about 85 percent."

"An estimate of the spectrum is based on the Laplace transform which is approximated at exponentially spaced samples and analysis frequencies. In this approximation the ratio of the intervals between pairs of adjacent sampling positions is a constant greater than one. The choice of this constant is influenced by the desired analysis bandwidth and by sampling effects. If analysis frequencies are spaced the same as sampling positions, this approximation becomes a discrete correlation. which can be computed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) or a number theoretic transform. Except at low-analysis frequencies, the analysis bandwidth is \"constant-Q,\" i.e., it is proportional to the analysis frequency. With a white noise input the noise in the computed spectrum is roughly constant at each analysis frequency. The numbers of samples and computations required for exponential spacing of samples and frequencies can be less than those required for equidistant spacing. Better performance at some (but not all) analysis frequencies is provided by a two-sided sampling arrangement consisting of a juxtaposition of the basic one-sided sampling arrangement and its mirror image."
"This paper is concerned with the digital estimation of the frequency response of a two-dimensional spatially invariant linear system through which an image has been passed and blurred. For the cases of uniform linear camera motion and an out-of-focus lens system it is shown that the power cepstrum of the image contains sufficient information to identify the blur. Methods for deblurring are presented, including restoration of the density version of the image. The restoration procedure consumes only a modest amount of computation time. Results are demonstrated on images blurred in the camera."
"The system described in this paper is subdivided into three main steps: pitch extraction, segmentation, and formant analysis. The pitch extractor uses an adaptive digital filter in time-domain transforming the speech signal into a signal similar to the glottal waveform. Using the levels of the speech signal and the differenced signal as parameters in time domain, the subsequent segmentation algorithm derives a signal parameter which describes the speed of articulatory movement. From this, the signal is divided into \"stationary\" and \"'transitional\" segments; one stationary segment is associated to one phoneme. For the formant tracking procedure, a subset of the pitch periods is selected by the segmentation algorithm and is transformed into frequency domain. The formant tracking algorithm uses a maximum detection strategy and continuity criteria for adjacent spectra. After this step, the total parameter set is offered to an adaptive universal pattern classifier which is trained by selected material before working. For stationary phonemes, the recognition rate is about 85 percent when training material and test material are uttered by the same speaker. The recognition rate is increased to about 90 percent when segmentation results are used."
"Subjects judged whether two masked utterances were spoken by the same or different speakers in an experiment designed to measure the influence of masking on speaker discrimination. Performance decreased from 80 percent correct judgments for a signal-to-noise ratio of +20 dB to 65 percent correct for a signal-to-noise ratio of -10 dB. Multidimensional scaling was used to determine speakers most sensitive to masking noise."
"For any given set of coefficient values for a second-order recursive digital filter, it is shown how to determine explicitly the periods of the forced response at which overflow oscillations can be sustained. The techniques that ate presented (which have quite general applicability) show for the first time how the concept of a P0matrix can be used to advantage in the study of nonlinear effects in digital filters."
"An approach to the machine organization of dedicated hardware digital signal processors is proposed that is based on a specialized representation of the processing coefficients derived from the canonical signed-digit code. This leads to a realization requiting the minimum number of add/subtract operations to mechanize the required multiplications and additions. The proposed organization is shown to be highly modular and well suited to integrated circuit implementation, and offers a significantly better performance when compared with existing realizations using prepackaged multipliers."
"An upper bound on the limit cycles due to multiplication roundoff in a fixed-point second-order digital filter is presented."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
 "A speech synthesis technique is described which incorporates acoustic models for sound propagation in a tube with yielding walls, turbulent noise generation at locations of constricted volume flow in the vocal tract, and the self-oscillatory properties of the vocal cord source. This formulation frees the experimenter from a traditional limitation, namely, the assumption of linear separability of sound source and resonant system. As a consequence, new opportunities accrue for building realistic physiological characteristics into the synthesizer. These built-in characteristics represent information that need not be overtly supplied to control the synthesizer. The system is used to synthesize test syllables from controls which are stylized models of articulation and connected speech from controls automatically derived from printed text. The synthesis technique demonstrates the feasibility of generating all speech sounds (voiced, unvoiced, nasal) from a common set of physiologically based control parameters, as the human does."
"Automatic speech recognition experiments are described in which several popular preprocessing and classification strategies are compared. Preprocessing is done either by linear predictive analysis or by bandpass filtering. The two approaches are shown to produce similar recognition scores. The classifier uses either linear time stretching or dynamic programming to achieve time alignment. It is shown that dynamic programming is of major importance for recognition of polysyllabic words. The speech is compressed into a quasi-phoneme character string or preserved uncompressed. Best results are obtained with uncompressed data, using nonlinear time registration for multisyllabic words."
"This correspondence describes an improved version of the linear prediction formant tracking algorithm which was described in [1]. The new algorithm, like the original one, applies continuity constraints and branches out from an anchor point in the middle of each vowel. The changes are that the initial estimates for the formant frequencies at the anchor are determined more carefully, and that the option of choosing a new anchor point near the original one is allowed if the original one caused problems."
"A variety of automatic speech recognition experiments have been executed that support a measure of confidence for utterance classification. The confidence measure tested was the ratio of the two best \"Hamming distance\" scores obtained in matching utterance templates with an unknown utterance. The results show that it is possible to reliably predict when the utterance classifier has made the correct decision."
"Significant time-saving can be achieved by a simple modification to the radix-2 decimation in-time fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm when the data sequence to be transformed contains a large number of zero-valued samples. The time-saving is accomplished by replacing M - L stages of the FFT computation with a simple recopying procedure where 2Mis the total number of points to be transformed of which only 2Lare nonzero."
"New bounds on the limit-cycle oscillations of a fixed-point second-order digital filter are found. The new bounds are smaller, for some values of the coefficients, than the presently available bounds."
"Preliminary results are presented of experiments with a recognition scheme intended for continuous speech. The scheme utilizes information about interphoneme contextual effects contained in formant transitions and employs internal trial synthesis and feedback comparison as a means for recognition. The aim is to achieve minimal sensitivity to the appreciable variability which occurs in the speech signal, even for utterances of a single speaker. While the approach outlined here is quite general, it has initially been tried out on vowel-stop-vowel utterances. Recognition scores obtained are encouraging and demonstrate the viability of the approach."
"The concept of spectral factorization is extended to two dimensions in such a way as to preserve the analytic characteristics of the factors. The factorization makes use of a homomorphic transform procedure due to Wiener. The resulting factors are shown to be recursively computable and stable in agreement with one-dimensional (1-D) spectral factorization. The factors are not generally two-dimensional (2-D) polynomials, but can be approximated as such. These results are applied to 2-D recursive filtering, filter design, and a computationally attractive stability test for recursive filters."
"In this work three structures are presented for evaluating in real time the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on successive sections of a sampled signal. Each section consists ofNelements and two successive sections are staggered ofM \\leq Nelements. Each structure evaluatesN/MDFT coefficients at every step and requires about(N/(2M)) \\log_{2} 4Mmultipliers."
"In this work the problem of evaluating successively the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on ordered sets ofNelements staggered ofMis considered. Three procedures for solving such a problem are given, of which two are recursive and one nonrecursive. The complexity of each procedure, in number of complex multiplications, is about(N/2) \\log_{2} 4M."
"The digital filtering process can be achieved by a set of phase shifters with suitable characteristics. A particular set, named polyphase network, is defined and analyzed. It permits the use of recursive devices for efficient sample-rate alteration. The comparison with conventional filters shows that, with the same active memory, a reduction of computation rate approaching a factor of 2 can be achieved when the alteration factor increases. A more substantial gain can be obtained in the direct realization of a uniform bank of recursive filters through combination of the polyphase network with a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) computer; savings in hardware also result from the low sensitivity of the structure to coefficient word lengths."

  "The general language-operated decision implementation system (GLODIS) represents a flexible, operating-system approach to the generation and implementation of complex rules for decision making in pattern recognition. GLODIS is briefly described from a general mathematical and philosophical point of view; a current implementation is described in the context of a phonemic-level segmenter for continuous speech. This segmenter is presented in sufficient detail for duplication by others, not only for speech segmentation but also for alternate applications of a similar nature. Performance data are given for a large amount (8\\frac{1}{2}min) of continuous speech, for a currently running version of the speech segmentation GLODIS. Recent results from a total continuous speech recognition system, which incorporates the above, are also given."
"This paper describes an implementation of a speaker independent system which can recognize connected digits. The overall recognition system consists of two separate but interrelated parts. The function of the first part of the system is to segment the digit string into the individual digits which comprise the string; the second part of the system then recognizes the individual digits based on the results of the segmentation. The segmentation of the digits is based on a voiced-unvoiced analysis of the digit string, as well as information about the location and amplitude of minima in the energy contour of the utterance. The digit recognition strategy is similar to the algorithm used by Sambur and Rabiner [1] for isolated digits, but with several important modifications due to the impreciseness with which the exact digit boundaries can be located. To evaluate the accuracy of the system in segmenting and recognizing digit strings a series of experiments was conducted. Using high-quality recordings from a soundproof booth the segmentation accuracy was found to be about 99 percent, and the recognition accuracy was about 91 percent across ten speakers (five male, five female). With recordings made in a noisy computer room the segmentation accuracy remained close to 99 percent, and the recognition accuracy was about 87 percent across another group of ten speakers (five male, five female)."
"It is common practice to partially characterize a filter with a finite portion of its impulse response, with the objective of generating a recursive approximation. This paper discusses the use of mixed first and second information, in the form of a finite portion of the impulse response and autocorrelation sequences. The discussion encompasses a number of techniques and algorithms for this purpose. Two approximation problems are studied: an interpolation problem and a least squares problem. These are shown to be closely related. The linear systems which form the solutions to these problems are shown to be stable. An efficient algorithm for obtaining solutions is given and shown to be closely related to a well-known algorithm of Levinson and the Jury stability test. The close connection between these algorithms suggests that they are fundamental in the numerical analysis of stable discrete-time linear systems."
"Real-time decomposition is investigated via cepstrum techniques for a signal composed of a basic wavelet and its echoes. Methods suitable for implementation as a specialized signal processor are outlined, and the real-time system performance is estimated. A system which utilizes the algorithms suggested is capable of wavelet recovery at sampling rates on the order of 105Hz."
"Recognition of steady-state vowels based on the residual energy of linear prediction was ascertained to be useful for a recognition system in which the reference data are taken from the intended speaker. Sharp speaker selectivity based on a threshold criterion suggests that the use of the residual signal energy may also be useful for speaker identification, especially for speaker screening in a large population."
"A concise formula is derived for the computation of mixed higher partial derivatives of digital filter transfer functions with respect to any combination of multiplier coefficients. If only one multiplier coefficient is involved in the differentiation, our formula specializes to a recent result of Crochiere [1]."
"The Q-matrix technique of bilinear transformation of a single-variable polynomial is extended to multivariable polynomials. A computer program for the transformation is included in the Appendix."
"In speech analysis, the voiced-unvoiced decision is usually performed in conjunction with pitch analysis. The linking of voiced-unvoiced (V-UV) decision to pitch analysis not only results in unnecessary complexity, but makes it difficult to classify short speech segments which are less than a few pitch periods in duration. In this paper, we describe a pattern recognition approach for deciding whether a given segment of a speech signal should be classified as voiced speech, unvoiced speech, or silence, based on measurements made on the signal. In this method, five different measurements are made on the speech segment to be classified. The measured parameters are the zero-crossing rate, the speech energy, the correlation between adjacent speech samples, the first predictor coefficient from a 12-pole linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis, and the energy in the prediction error. The speech segment is assigned to a particular class based on a minimum-distance rule obtained under the assumption that the measured parameters are distributed according to the multidimensional Gaussian probability density function. The means and covariances for the Gaussian distribution are determined from manually classified speech data included in a training set. The method has been found to provide reliable classification with speech segments as short as 10 ms and has been used for both speech analysis-synthesis and recognition applications. A simple nonlinear smoothing algorithm is described to provide a smooth 3-level contour of an utterance for use in speech recognition applications. Quantitative results and several examples illustrating the performance of the method are included in the paper."
"Correlators are powerful instruments for analyzing signals. Recently many digital correlators have been developed. Their main parts are delays, a multiplier, and an integrator, the basic principles being the same in most cases. In this paper, the author proposes a new method (the M.I. Unit) which provides a multiplication and an integration all in one circuit by using delta modulation. Due to using this method, it is suggested that simpler digital correlators can be constructed."
"A new noise expression is formulated for the class of fixed-point digital filters described by the state equations, and two methods of its computation are discussed. The effects of possible structure transformation and state-amplitude scalings are then incorporated in this expression, and the results have been analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the output noise and state amplitudes are inversely proportional, and that an elementary transformation is well suited for a step-by-step generation of a low-noise filter."

"An alternative form of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is developed. The new algorithm has the peculiarity that none of the multiplying constants required are complex-most are pure imaginary. The advantages of the new form would, therefore, seem to be most pronounced in systems for which multiplication are most costly."
"The hardware design and implementation of a Fermat number transform (FNT) is described. The arithmetic logic design is treated in detail and a new data representation for integers modulo a Fermat number is derived.

"This paper describes digital hardware for automatically stopping a cassette recorder upon detection of a prerecorded tone. This hardware is used in conjunction with experiments on computer assisted voice wiring experiments being performed at Western Electric locations [1]. For these experiments a sequence of instructions is automatically recorded on a cassette tape by a computer voice response system. At the end of each instruction, a tone is recorded. The hardware detects this tone and stops the cassette recorder. The operator, after performing the prescribed wiring instruction, manually restarts the cassette recorder for the next instruction. The technique used to detect the tone is a simple digital method comparing the axis crossings of the signal to a fixed threshold. This threshold is determined based on knowledge of the tone frequency, duration, and amplitude. When the signal axis crossings exceeds this threshold during two consecutive 40 ms nonoverlapping intervals the tone is detected and the tape recorder is stopped. The method described is a robust one which is rather insensitive to normal tape recorder problems, e.g., wow and loss of signal level due to battery drainage. The tone detection hardware requires nominal power and is portable."
 "This paper discusses a digital formulation of the phase vocoder, an analysis-synthesis system providing a parametric representation of a speech waveform by its short-time Fourier transform. Such a system is of interest both for data-rate reduction and for manipulating basic speech parameters. The system is designed to be an identity system in the absence of any parameter modifications. Computational efficiency is achieved by employing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to perform the bulk of the computation in both the analysis and synthesis procedures, thereby making the formulation attractive for implementation on a minicomputer."
"The existence of limit cycles in combinatorial filters using two's complement truncation arithmetic is investigated in this paper. Exact results for limit cycles of period one and two are presented. Some results for longer period limit cycles are obtained using an effective value linear model. Bounds on these limit cycles are also derived. The accessability of the limit cycles is briefly discussed."
  "An important consideration in speech processing involves classification of speech spectra. Several methods for performing this classification are discussed. A number of these were selected for comparative evaluation. Two measures of performance-accuracy and stability-were derived through the use of an automatic performance evaluation system. Over 3000 hand-labeled spectra were used. Of those evaluated, a linearly mean-corrected minimum distance measure, on a 40-point spectral representation with a square (or cube) norm was consistently superior to the other methods."
"The problem of bounding the output quantization errors in linear two-dimensional recursive filters is examined. A two-dimensional filter is analyzed by developing a model for the filter based on a vector formed from the two-dimensional output sequence. A deterministic bound is obtained and then applied to a special class of second-order filters."
"An improved algorithm is presented for ordering the poles and zeros of fixed-point recursive digital filters so as to minimize the effect of roundoff noise. The method proceeds by successive improvement, and yields local optima which cannot be improved further by interchanging a pair of poles or zeros. The resulting assignments found for four filters of orders 8-22 are the best known."
"Time-domain methods for the design of recursive digital filters using a squared error criterion are compared with a frequency-domain technique. Levy's method, which has been used to estimate transfer functions of continuous-time systems is modified to obtain design equations for digital filters. A special case of Levy's method is shown to be essentially equivalent to the time-domain methods."

  "In this paper several issues concerning the design and implementation of multistage decimators, interpolators, and narrow-band filters are discussed. In particular, the question of designing these systems in terms of minimum storage rather than minimum computation rate is examined. It is shown that a design which uses finite impulse response (FIR) filters for each stage, and which is minimized for storage is essentially minimized in terms of computation rate as well. The problem of further improvements in designing decimators and interpolators by taking advantage of DON'T CARE frequency bands is also discussed. For the early stages in a multistage design it is shown that fairly significant reductions in filter order can be achieved in this manner. A third issue in the design process is the question of practical schemes for efficient implementation of multistage decimators and interpolators in both hardware and software. One such efficient implementation is discussed in this paper. Finally, the problem of designing multistage decimators and interpolators using elliptic infinite impulse response (IIR) filters is discussed. It is shown that multistage IIR designs can be somewhat more efficient computationally than single-stage designs; however, the storage efficiency of the multistage IIR design is worse than that of the single-stage IIR design."
"A fast sequency ordered Walsh Transform algorithm is presented, which is the complement to one developed by Manz. It is in place, is its own inverse, and accepts data in normal order, returning the coefficients in bit-reversed sequency order."
"This paper presents the results of an examination of rapid amplitude compression following high-pass filtering as a method for processing speech, prior to reception by the listener, as a means of enhancing the intelligibility of speech in high noise levels. Arguments supporting this particular signal processing method are based on the results of previous perceptual studies of speech in noise. In these previous studies, it has been shown that high-pass filtered/clipped speech offers a significant gain in the intelligibility of speech in white noise over that for unprocessed speech at the same signal-to-noise ratios. Similar results have also been obtained for speech processed by high-pass filtering alone. The present paper explores these effects and it proposes the use of high-pass filtering followed by rapid amplitude compression as a signal processing method for enhancing the intelligibility of speech in noise. It is shown that this new method resuits in a substantial improvement in the intelligibility of speech in white noise over normal speech and over previously implemented methods."
"A realization of nonrecursive digital filters using adaptive differential pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) as the analog-to-digital conversion scheme is presented. Output samples are computed by a sequence of read-only memory (ROM) lookups, shifts, and additions, thereby eliminating multipliers from the filter structure. Such ADPCM filters can typically operate three times faster than comparable PCM filters realized using high-speed hardware multipliers, with power consumption reduced by 25 percent. Equations are derived for computation time per output sample, signal-to-noise ratio, and coefficient accuracy necessary to achieve the optimum predicted performance. Computer simulation results agree well with theoretical predictions."
"Recent experiments in speech synthesis have shown that, by an appropriate eigenvector analysis, a set of orthogonal parameters can be obtained that is essentially independent of all linguistic information across an analyzed utterance, but highly indicative of the identity of the speaker. The orthogonal parameters are formed by a linear transformation of the linear prediction parameters, and can achieve their recognition potential without the need of any time-normalization procedure. The speaker discrimination potential of the linear prediction orthogonal parameters was formally tested in both a speaker identification and a speaker verification experiment. The speech data for these experiments consisted of six repetitions of the same sentence spoken by 21 male speakers on six separate occasions. For both identification and verification, the recognition accuracy of the orthogonal parameters exceeded 99 percent for high-quality speech inputs. For telephone inputs, the accuracy exceeded 96 percent. In a separate text-independent speaker identification experiment, an accuracy of 94 percent was achieved for high-quality speech inputs."
 "Two commonly used signal analysis techniques are linear prediction and homomorphic filtering. Each has particular advantages and limitations. This paper considers several ways of combining these methods to capitalize on the advantages of both. The resulting techniques, referred to collectively as homomorphic prediction, are potentially useful for pole-zero modeling and inverse filtering of mixed phase signals. Two of these techniques are illustrated by means of synthetic examples."
"This correspondence describes properties of multilevel pseudorandom arrays obtained by two-dimensional digital filtering of binary pseudonoise (PN) arrays derived from maximal-length linear binary sequences."
"A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is developed for determining time delay between signals received at two spatially separated sensors in the presence of uncorrelated noise. This ML estimator can be realized as a pair of receiver prefilters followed by a cross correlator. The time argument at which the correlator achieves a maximum is the delay estimate. The ML estimator is compared with several other proposed processors of similar form. Under certain conditions the ML estimator is shown to be identical to one proposed by Hannan and Thomson [10] and MacDonald and Schultheiss [21]. Qualitatively, the role of the prefilters is to accentuate the signal passed to the correlator at frequencies for which the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is highest and, simultaneously, to suppress the noise power. The same type of prefiltering is provided by the generalized Eckart filter, which maximizes the S/N ratio of the correlator output. For low S/N ratio, the ML estimator is shown to be equivalent to Eckart prefiltering."
"Expressions for the coefficient sensitivities of cascaded digital lattices introduced by Itakura and Saito and further developed by Gray and Markel are calculated using chain parameters. It is shown that a cascade of lattices with ε = +1 exhibits zero coefficient sensitivities at zero frequency."
"Number theoretic transforms (NTT's) that can be used for the convolution of complex integer sequences are defined. A unified setting is provided wherein these transforms may be defined for all odd moduli, thus extending recent results on this topic. Multiplication-free implementation of certain of these transforms is possible. When these transforms are used to implement convolution, the resulting computation is exact."
"A recently published algorithm for the estimation of arithmetic autocorrelation functions may be further refined. The premultiplications may be converted into simple additions which are efficiently computed within the algorithm. Savings in storage and computational effort are realized."
"A binary arithmetic that permits the exact computation of the Fermat number transform (FNT) is described. This technique involves arithmetic in a binary code corresponding to the simplest one of a set of code translations from the normal binary representation of each integer in the ring of integers modulo a Fermat number Ft= 2b+ 1, b = 2t. The resulting FNT binary arithmetic operations are of the complexity of 1's complement arithmetic as in the case of a previously proposed technique which corresponds to another one of the set of code translations. The general multiplication of two integers modulo Ftrequired in the computation of FNT convolution is discussed."
 "A correct proof of Huang's theorem on the stability of two-dimensional causal recursive digital filters is developed using a maximum modulus theorem for algebraic functions."
"In this correspondence a complete proof of Huang's stability theorem for two-dimensional discrete filters is presented. The proof is based on certain properties of algebraic functions. It appears that Huang's original proof is not complete and it is hoped that this proof will fill the gap."
 "This correspondence compares the effectiveness of the discrete cosine and Fourier transforms in decorrelating sampled signals with Markov-1 statistics. It is shown that the discrete cosine transform (DCT) offers a higher (or equal) effectiveness than the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) for all values of the correlation coefficient. The mean residual correlation is shown to vanish as the inverse square root of the sample size."
 "The details of the implementation of a syntax-controlled acoustic encoder of a speech understanding system (SUS) are presented. Finite-state automata operating on artificial descriptions of suprasegmentals and global spectral features isolate syllables in continuous speech. Then a combinational algorithm tracks the formants for the voiced intervals of each syllable, and other algorithms provide a complete structural description of spectral and prosodic features for a spoken sentence. Such a description consists of a string of symbols and numerical attributes and is a representation of speech in terms of perceptually significant primitive forms. It contains all the information required to reconstruct the analyzed sentence with a formant synthesizer; it can be used directly either for emitting or verifying hypotheses at the lexical level of an SUS and for automatically learning phonetic features by grammatical inference."
"Two preliminary studies comparing the intelligibilities of predictor-coefficient versus formant-frequency-coded speech and the intelligibilities of predictor-coefficient-coded speech using different numbers of coefficients are reported."
"The finite wordlength effects in the read-only memory (ROM) digital filter are studied. By quantizing the coefficients before the programming of the ROM, the two problems of coefficient accuracy and roundoff error are decoupled. This leads to a filter which is asymptotically linear."
"The three gradient-based algorithms of 1) steepest descent, 2) Newton's method, and 3) the linearization algorithm are applied to the problem of synthesizing linear recursive filters in the time domain. It is shown that each of these algorithms requires knowledge of the associated recursive filter's first-order sensitivity vectors, and, in the case of the Newton method, second-order sensitivity vectors as well. Systematic procedures for generating these sensitivity vectors by computing the response of a companion filter structure are then presented. Using the ideal low-pass filter as a design objective, it is then demonstrated that the linearization algorithm is particularly well suited for recursive filter design. On the other hand, the steepest descent and Newton methods are found to work rather poorly for this class of problems. Reasons for these empirical observed results are postulated."
"A procedure is presented to test an arbitrary function of two variables N(x, y) to see if a separator function exists such that S[N(x, y)] = A (x) + B(y). If so, the procedure evaluates S[.],A,B. Necessary conditions for the existence of S[.] are established and some limitations are given in a theorem on sufficient conditions. Examples and a canonic representation of the test and procedure are also presented."
"A comparative performance study of seven pitch detection algorithms was conducted. A speech data base, consisting of eight utterances spoken by three males, three females, and one child was constructed. Telephone, close talking microphone, and wideband recordings were made of each of the utterances. For each of the utterances in the data base; a \"standard\" pitch contour was semiautomatically measured using a highly sophisticated interactive pitch detection program. The \"standard\" pitch contour was then compared with the pitch contour that was obtained from each of the seven programmed pitch detectors. The algorithms used in this study were 1) a center clipping, infinite-peak clipping, modified autocorrelation method (AUTOC), 2) the cepstral method (CEP), 3) the simplified inverse filtering technique (SIFT) method, 4) the parallel processing time-domain method (PPROC), 5) the data reduction method (DARD), 6) a spectral flattening linear predictive coding (LPC) method, and 7) the average magnitude difference function (AMDF) method. A set of measurements was made on the pitch contours to quantify the various types of errors which occur in each of the above methods. Included among the error measurements were the average and standard deviation of the error in pitch period during voiced regions, the number of gross errors in the pitch period, and the average number of voiced-unvoiced classification errors. For each of the error measurements, the individual pitch detectors could be rank ordered as a measure of their relative performance as a function of recording condition, and pitch range of the various speakers. Performance scores are presented for each of the seven pitch detectors based on each of the categories of error."
"A synthesis-by-rule program can be thought of as a functional model of human sentence production. The phonological component of this model accepts as input a linear string of symbols that have been produced by the semantics component, syntactic component, and lexical component of a grammar of English. This abstract representation for an utterance is transformed by the phonological component into a narrow phonetic transcription and a specification of stress levels, segmental durations, and aspects of the fundamental frequency contour."
"There are eight linear transformations of the spectral plane which map the frequency axes onto themselves. These transformations can be used to change the pass and stop regions of a two-dimensional digital filter. A stable realization is assured by transforming the data rather than the system transfer function."
"The properties and interrelationships among four measures of distance in speech processing are theoretically and experimentally discussed. The root mean square (rms) log spectral distance, cepstral distance, likelihood ratio (minimum residual principle or delta coding (DELCO) algorithm), and a cosh measure (based upon two nonsymmetrical likelihood ratios) are considered. It is shown that the cepstral measure bounds the rms log spectral measure from below, while the cosh measure bounds it from above. A simple nonlinear transformation of the likelihood ratio is shown to be highly correlated with the rms log spectral measure over expected ranges. Relationships between distance measure values and perception are also considered. The likelihood ratio, cepstral measure, and cosh measure are easily evaluated recursively from linear prediction filter coefficients, and each has a meaningful and interrelated frequency domain interpretation. Fortran programs are presented for computing the recursively evaluated distance measures."

"A method for estimating the pitch period of voiced speech sounds is developed based on a maximum likelihood (ML) formulation. It is capable of resolution finer than one sampling period and is shown to perform better in the presence of noise than the cepstrum method."
"A numerical method is presented for designing digital filters. The method allows one to minimize the mean-square error or noise power over some intervals of frequency, while simultaneously constraining the maximum error in other intervals of frequency. Thus, for example, one can minimize noise power from a stopband of frequencies while constraining signal fidelity in a passband of frequencies by limiting the maximum passband deviation."
"A particularly simple way to control fast Fourier transform (FFT) hardware is described. The method produces the indices both for inputs of each butterfly operation and for the appropriate W. In addition, this method allows parallel organization of the memory such that at any stage the two inputs and outputs of each butterfly belong to different memory units, hence can always be accessed in parallel."
"Adaptive linear prediction (ALP) recently has received a great deal of attention for spectral analysis, system modeling, and speech encoding. The conventional approach used to implement ALP involves the computation of a sample covariance matrix for a block of data and solution of an associated set of simultaneous equations to obtain the predictor coefficients. This paper describes an alternate approach that uses the least mean square (LMS) gradient, stochastic-approximation algorithm, commonly used in many other adaptive systems. A complete 8-coefficient hardward system based on this approach has been designed and constructed and is described in this paper. The system consists of an analyzer that computes the eight ALP coefficients in real time and a reconstructor that forms an all-pole model filter using the computed coefficients. Several examples are presented to illustrate the concepts introduced. Each example includes an analytical discussion followed by experimental verification. Applications of ALP for spectral analysis, instantaneous frequency measurement, and speech encoding are discussed and experimental results obtained with the real-time hardware are presented."
"A two-band compression system was designed to improve the intelligibility of speech in noise for persons suffering from sensori-neural hearing impairment. Experiments were carried out at 0 and +6 dB signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio with expansion below compression threshold. Six subjects had mean discrimination scores at S/N of 6 dB of 46, 77, and 87 percent with unprocessed speech (present heating aid), compression but linear below threshold, and compression with expansion below threshold, respectively. At the 0 dB S/N test score means were 21, 61 and 69 percent, respectively."
"The topic of quantization and bit allocation in speech processing is studied using an L2norm. Closed-form expressions are derived for the root mean square (rms) spectral deviation due to variations in one, two, or multiple parameters. For one-parameter variation, the reflection coefficients, log area ratios, and inverse sine coefficients are studied. It is shown that, depending upon the criterion chosen, either log area ratios or inverse sine quantization can be viewed as optimal. From a practical point of view, it is shown experimentally that very little difference exists among the various quantization methods beyond the second coefficient. Two-parameter variations are studied in terms of formant frequency and bandwidth movement and in terms of a two-pair quantization scheme. A lower bound on the number of quantization levels required to satisfy a given maximum spectral deviation is derived along with the two-pair quantization scheme which approximately satisfies the bound. It is shown theoretically that the two-pair quantization scheme has a 10-bit superiority over other above-mentioned quantization schemes in the sense of theoretically assuring that a maximum overall log spectral deviation will not be exceeded."
 "A speech processing system has been developed in which the unvoiced portion of speech is bandwidth compressed from an original bandwidth of 4000 Hz into a low-frequency band not exceeding 1000 Hz, in which hearing impaired subjects with severe high-frequency hearing losses still possess some residual speech perception. The basic compression operation is based upon a time-domain time expansion technique, and the resulting reduction in bandwidth is accomplished without relinquishing the essential information contained in unvoiced speech. Thus, subjects are able again to perceive unvoiced speech of fair intelligibility where conventional hearing aids normally fail to be of any assistance. The imposition of stringent operating requirements such as portability, real-time operation, and functionality in a real-listening environment composed of many competing speech and noise sources, eliminated numerous elegant speech processing approaches."
"We are interested in determining whether the given utterance comes from a member of a given speaker group or an imposter. If it is the former, we are interested in determining the identity of the speaker. The only knowledge available is a set of known utterances from the given group of speakers. The given utterance is manually divided into phonemes without necessarily ascertaining the identity of phonemes. Using statistical decision theory, we will develop various types of tests for speaker verification and identification using only one phoneme segment or the entire utterance. We will consider related problems such as the methods of clustering speakers to aid speaker verification, the optimal choice of phonemes for speaker recognition. Next we consider the role of speaker variability in speech recognition and recognize its complementarity to the problem of optimal choice of phonemes for speaker recognition. We illustrate the efficacy of the various methods developed here by considering the speaker and speech identification problems with three speech data bases."
"A functioning system is described in which spoken Fortran-like programs can be reliably interpreted by a computer. Speech is encoded into cepstral patterns using a shifting overlapping 32-ms Hamming window. A vocabulary of 26 words was selected so that the distance between different words, in their cepstral representation, was large. The syntax of individual phoneme strings in a word, and the syntax chosen for the programming language, were used to resolve ambiguous decisions. Feedback to the programmer greatly increased the reliability of the system, since, 1) mistaken decisions could be corrected, and 2) the programmer gradually learned to speak in such a way that system mistakes were greatly reduced. With two trained speakers, the recognition rate was 50-75 percent on sentences, 75-90 percent on words, and with user feedback and correction, the recognition rate was 100 percent with no more than two repetitions for long statements. The good performance achieved was due to the well-chosen vocabulary, strong syntactic support, and speaker training. The basic drawback for the system at present is that the initial training of the user is a time-consuming process. However, further improvement has since been achieved by using the initial isolated cepstral prototypes to locate new prototypes in samples of continuous speech, and then using the \"continuous prototypes\" for recognition. Currently, formant trajectories, derived from a pitch synchronous, linear prediction analysis, are being used, and an automatic stress analysis program provides segmentation, and guides the selection of key allophones."
"Truncated series expansion is used to obtain discrete-time windows which are optimal in the least-square sense for a given number of terms. The representation suggested in the paper is so rapidly convergent that an excellent approximation to the exact least-square optimum is achieved even if only a few terms are kept. As a consequence, the resulting windows are easy to obtain and economical to implement in practical applications."
"A classification is given of the various possible nonlinear effects that can occur in recursive digital filters due to signal quantization and adder overflow. The effects include limit cycles, overflow oscillations, and quantization noise. A review is given of recent literature on this subject. Alternative methods of avoiding some of these nonlinear phenomena are discussed."
"In 1972 Shanks conjectured that the least squares inverse of a two-dimensional polynomial is stable, and verified the conjecture numerically for certain low-degree two-dimensional polynomials. Recently the conjecture was proved false. However, in this note we prove the conjecture for all polynomials of a restricted and low degree. The key to the verification lies in utilizing the centrosymmetric properties of the Toeplitz matrix which arises in an equation yielding the coefficients of the approximate inverse."
"Some statistical properties of the Chinese language are studied from an information-theoretic point of view. The entropies of Chinese characters, radicals, and Mandarin syllables are evaluated."
  "A computer program is presented for designing digital elliptic filters of the four most common types: low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and bandstop. The program is presented in Fortran IV. The various numerical algorithms required for implementing the elliptic functions are referenced in the program and are obtained from readily available tables of mathematical functions. Examples for each filter type are presented."
"The family of filters {H(F(z)):F(z) a frequency transformation} generated from a prototype filter H(z) is shown to possess certain common properties. These are coordinate-free quantities (called second-order modes) which are invariant under frequency transformation. The invariance is significant in the design of low-noise fixed-point digital filter structures since the second-order modes characterize the minimum attainable noise. Filter structures (including parallel, cascade, and ladder configurations) are studied whose output noise is essentially independent of bandwidth and center frequency. An analysis of direct form structures (whether isolated or as one section within a cascade or parallel configuration) results in an expression giving the dominant term in the output noise as a function of the parameter in the low-pass-low-pass transformation. This noise term approaches infinity as bandwidth approaches zero. Thus, for narrowband filters, a difference of several orders of magnitude in the output noise can exist between a scaled direct form (having six multiplications per two-pole section) and the optimal form (having nine multiplications per two-pole section)."
"An important problem in some communication systems is the performance of linear prediction (LPC) analysis with speech inputs that have been corrupted by (signal-correlated) quantization distortion or additive white noise. To gain a first insight into this problem, a high-quality speech sample was deliberately degraded by using various degrees (bit rates of 16 kbps and more) of differential PCM (DPCM), and delta modulation (DM) quantization, and by the introduction of additive white noise. The resulting speech samples were then analyzed to obtain the LPC control signals: pitch, gain, and the linear prediction coefficients. These control parameters were then compared to the parameters measured in the original, high quality signal. The measurements of pitch perturbations were assessed on the basis of how many points exceeded an appropriate difference limen. A distance measure proposed by Itakura was used to compare the original LPC coefficients with the coefficients measured from the degraded speech. In addition, the measured control signals were used to synthesize speech for perceptual evaluation. Results suggest that LPC analysis/synthesis is fairly immune to the degradation of DPCM quantization. The effects of DM quantization are more severe and the effects of additive white noise are the most serious."

"Speech synthesizers for computer voice output are most useful when not restricted to a prestored vocabulary. The simplest approach to unrestricted text-to-speech translation uses a small set of letter-to-sound rules, each specifying a pronunciation for one or more letters in some context. Unless this approach yields sufficient intelligibility, routine addition of text-to-speech translation to computer systems is unlikely, since more elaborate approaches, embodying large pronunciation dictionaries or linguistic analysis, require too much of the available computing resources. The work here described demonstrates the practicality of routine text-to-speech translation. A set of 329 letter-to-sound rules has been developed. These translate English text into the international phonetic alphabet (IPA), producing correct pronunciations for approximately 90 percent of the words, or nearly 97 percent of the phonemes, in an average text sample. Most of the remaining words have single errors easily correctable by the listener. Another set of rules translates IPA into the phonetic coding for a particular commercial speech synthesizer. This report describes the technical approach used and the support hardware and software developed. It gives overall performance figures, detailed statistics showing the importance of each rule, and listings of a translation program and another used in rule development."
"A linear programming algorithm is described for designing circulant Markov chains which generate random waveforms whose spectral densities have specified poles. These chains can be implemented by random jumping in a fixed table, and have the advantages of speed and simplicity. Possible applications to speech synthesis are discussed."
"A statistical model for roundoff errors is used to predict the output noise of the two common forms of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, the decimations in-time and in-frequency. This paper deals with two's complement arithmetic with either rounding or chopping. The total mean-square errors and the mean-square errors for the individual points are derived for radix-2 FFT's. Results for mixed-radix FFT are also given."
"This correspondence contains a demonstration of the effectiveness and validity of the Fletcher-Powell optimization technique as opposed to the algorithm presented in the above paper by Dubois and Leich."
"A simple accurate approximation for the bias of the estimate of magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) is derived from exact theoretical expressions. Simulation results corroborate the exact and approximate expressions, all of which differ from a previously published simulation result on this topic. A method for reducing the bias is suggested and investigated."
 "A statistical decision approach to the recognition of connected digits is described in this paper. The method can be either speaker dependent (i.e., each new speaker must first train the system on representative digit strings before he can successfully use the system) or speaker independent. Multiple repetitions of each digit (spoken in connected strings) are used in the training sequence. Repetitions of the same digit are combined by linearly warping the individual reference patterns to the speakers' average length for the digit. Statistics of the mean and covariance of the recognition parameters between repetitions of the same digit are computed and are used in the recognition phase of the system. Once a spoken digit string has been segmented, the recognition of each digit within the string is achieved using a distance measure based on an expanded form of the principle of minimum residual error. In cases where a great deal of coarticulation can be anticipated between adjacent digits (i.e., between digits bounded by voiced regions) a second distance metric is employed. This metric includes both the effects of the analysis estimation error and the effects of coarticulation. The analysis parameters used in this system are the linear prediction coefficients (LPC's) of a 10-pole LPC analysis. For stability purposes, the linear predictive coding (LPC) coefficients are converted to parcor or reflection coefficients prior to the linear warping, and then the warped parcor coefficients are converted back to LPC coefficients for recognition purposes. The recognition system was tested on six speakers in the speaker-dependent mode with recognition accuracies of from 97 to 100 percent. It was also tested with 10 new speakers in the speaker-independent mode, with a digit recognition accuracy of 95 percent."

"This book is the first in-depth unified presentation of the important area of linear prediction in speech processing. It covers linear prediction from detailed theoretical considerations through practical applications including Fortran program implementations of important algorithms. Linear Prediction Formulations, Speech Synthesis Structures, Spectral Analysis, Formant and Fundamental Frequency Estimation, Computational Considerations, and Vocoders are presented with emphasis on interrelating the two most widely used forms (the autocorrelation method and the covariance method). Because of the depth of presentation from theoretical derivations through computer programs, the material should be applicable to a wide range of backgrounds.

"Glottal sound waveforms were derived by an inverse filtering method from sustained vowels uttered by 217 patients of laryngeal diseases and by 20 normal speakers. Various parameters which indicate individual characteristics were extracted from autocorrelation function, correlograms of time series of fundamental period and peak amplitude in each fundamental period, and spectral envelope of the glottal sound waveform. Then, interdependency among the acoustical parameters and the relation between those and medical parameters utilized in diagnosis were examined by principal-component analysis. Using canonical analysis, classification of some laryngeal diseases was attempted based on those acoustical parameters."
"Formant frequencies of the five Japanese vowels uttered by 35 deaf and hard of hearing children were measured utilizing sound spectrograph. The distribution of the formant frequencies on the F1-F2 plane for each kind of vowel and the relation between the formant frequencies of the five Japanese vowels of each of the defective children were compared with those of 8 normal children. Based on a muscle contraction model of speech organs, those results were analyzed in terms of the nature of imperfection in articulatory movement."
"When discretizing continuous-time systems or signals, one is often interested in preserving a property termed covariance-invariance. In this paper a technique is outlined for synthesizing discrete-time systems and signals which are covariance-invariant with corresponding continuous-time systems and signals. Applications of the technique to process simulation, minimum mean-squared error estimation, and digital filter synthesis are outlined, with example designs presented for covariance-invariant Butterworth and Chebychev digital filters. Based on the frequency response of these designs it is argued that the method of covariance-invariance is superior to the methods of impulse-invariance and bilinear-z as a response matching design technique for the synthesis of digital filters. This superiority is especially apparent at sampling rates that are marginal with respect to filter critical frequencies."
 "If, in a speech understanding system, word matching is performed at the phonetic level, then the accurate determination of the locations and identities of words present in an unknown utterance is necessarily limited by the phonetic segmentation and labeling. Verification offers an alternative strategy by doing a top-down parametric word match independent of segmentation and labeling. The result is a distance measure between the reference parameterization of a hypothesized word and the computed parameterization of the real speech. This distance is interpreted as the likelihood of that word having actually occurred over a given portion of the utterance."
"Speakers lengthened the duration of a noun when it was referred to again later in the same sentence by a pronoun. The effect was observed for the very first word of an utterance and for coreferents that spanned a major syntactic clause boundary."
"The magnitude and phase responses of IIR or FIR digital filters can be determined analytically or graphically from the filter pole-zero pattern in the z-plane. Only analytical methods of determlning the group delay response have been presented. In this work we shall show that the group delay response of any digital filter can be determined graphically from the pole-zero pattern of the filter transfer function in the z-plane. This would be quite helpful for designers working on the design of digital delay equalizers and digital filters satisfying predetermined delay characteristics. The method, proof and several illustrative examples shall be presented."
"We have outlined a synthesis procedure which minimizes the output noise in cascade and parallel connections of second-order sections caused by roundoff of internal storage registers. Theorem 1 characterizes the optimal fi Iter and dictates the synthesis procedure. The output noise is made up of two terms. The dominant noise term for block optimal fi lters is independent of bandwidth unl ike the usual cascade and paralle I connections of second-order di rect forms. For narrow band filters improvements of 30 to 40 db are not uncommon. Numerical results yield excellent agreement between theory and simulation."
"For the class of digital filters described by the state equations, a new expression for the roundoff noise and the dynamic range constraint equations have been established. Then, minimization of the roundoff noise subject to the l2norm dynamic range constraint is considered. In particular, a lower bound and the global minimum of the unit noise, i.e., the noise generated under the assumption that each state equation contains exactly one noise source, have been obtained. A method of realizing the minimum unit noise filter, along with a numerical example is also given."
"Truncation and rounding operations in digital signal processing introduce harmonic and intermodulation distortion for low level inputs or pure signal inputs. A two step random rounding procedure alleviates these problems by introducing \"white\" quantization noise. Some results bearing on the quantization noise levels as a function of input level and on linearity are presented. In one application a simple recursive integrator is found to have dramatic correlated quantization error affects unless random rounding is employed."
"In this paper we discuss a number of issues concerning the design of optimal decimators, and interpolators and their application to narrow band filtering. We show that a design which is optimized for minimum storage is essentially optimum in terms of its number of required multiplications and additions as well. We then discuss a practical scheme for efficiently implementing decimators and interpolators."
 "Distortion in 3 types of loudspeakers is measured and compared. Horn, vented box, and total enclosure type speakers display increasing amounts of distortion in the given order. The most important type of distortion is modulation. Since this is usually several times the magnitude of harmonic distortion, and consists of frequencies which are not harmonically related to the input frequencies, modulation distortion is much more obnoxious than harmonic distortion. Modulating frequencies in the subsonic range were found to produce high modulation distortion in vented-box speakers. Reviewers of equipment who report 0.01% amplitude modulation distortion in amplifiers and ignore 10% or more amplitude and frequency modulation distortion in loudspeakers might well revise their prejudices."
"Signals processed im 33.3 rev/min disc recording systems suffer some nonlinear distortion at several stages of the recording and manufacturing chain. These distortions are normally considered insignificant compared to those caused by the nonlinearities of the stylus-groove interaction during playback. The nature and measurement of these playback distortions will be discussed. Measured values of distortion produced by RIAA-equalized playback systems will be presented (2nd harmonic distortion of a single-sinewave input signal, amplitude and frequency intermodulation distortion of an SMPTE two-tone input signal, and difference-tone intermodulation distortion of a CCIF two-tone input signal). The audible (and inaudible) effects of specific nonlinearities in the playback process will be demonstrated by playing music and test signals through an electronic simulator of the stylus-groove interaction."
  "For the error estimation by simulation a matrix descrip tion of time invariant, causal, linear, discrete time sys tems is used, that yields a simulation algorithm which is independent of the individual filter structure to be simulated. Various quantization characteristics can easily be used by a modular simulation concept. Since the quantization characteristic of the simulating computer may influence the desired quantization characteristic, it is necessary to suppress the quantization of the simulating computer. Examples demonstrate the applicability of the described simulation method in the field of round-off noise analysis."
 "The development of the Hydroshock®III impulsive sound source has allowed the collection of acoustic target strength data over a wide frequency range. Deconvolution of a shock-echo pair provides a wideband target impulse response. Convolution off this impulse response with any sonar ping whose spectrum is defined in the frequency range of the impulse response will generate the echo that would have resulted from that ping. The advantages of frequency domain processing are discussed and several simulated echoes are presented."
"GASP is a General Arithmetic Signal Processor originally designed for real time linear predictive speech analysis. A \"correlation\" or sum of products unit forms the heart of the processor, which employs a dual bus system for arguments. Incorporation of a separate data lookahead memory with eight autoincrementing data pointers reduces argument fetch times. The processor operates on 20 bit words consisting of 16 bits mantissa and 4 bits exponent. Instruction fetch times are minimised by using a 20 bit Cache memory containing microcoded instructions with associated hardware loop counters. This paper describes the design philosophy and gives some ideas of hardware implementation."
"This paper describes a practical computer algorithm for the solution of constrained least-squares filtering equations. This algorithm exploits the block-Toeplitz and block-circulant properties of the filtering equations. Specifically, these properties are utilized to adapt Kutikov's and Akakai's algorithms for the solution of block-Toeplitz systems. Our approach generalizes the formulation considered by Claerbout. Furthermore, it effects substantial savings in memory storage compared to existing approaches, and is therefore well suited for solving large systems."
"Summary form only given, as follows. A vibration pick-up type ear microphone was developed in order to make howlingless,mask and free hand microphones or the like. Instead of monodirectional, noise cancelling, laryngeal and forehead microphone, this microphone is made by use of a pie3o element which is put in the ear along the canal and picks up the bone conducted sound by the principle of acceleration type vibration pick-up. By use of this newly developed microphone, phonating aid for patients with highly disturbed voices, loudspeaker built in gas masks, microphones used in airports, microphones for patrolling cars and wireless communicating apparatuses employed in industry or constructive fields have been designed and plays a very important role in daily use."
"This work describes the Aeronutronic Ford Programmable Array Processor (PAP). The PAP is a high-speed programmable signal processor which has been designed to perform functions such as those required by a narrowband communications terminal. The PAP design employs many of the features of a dedicated pipeline processor while maintaining the flexibility of a programmable signal processing computer."
"When reading a text a native speaker pronounces most words correctly even if they are unknown to him. During this process he makes use of his knowledge of the language, the semantic content and the syntax. However, if we take away all information except the spelling and some pronunciation rules on the word level, the task would be more difficult. This is basically the case in our text-to-speech synthesis system containing neither semantic and syntactic analysis nor a word or morpheme dictionary. At the conference the function of our present synthesis system will be discussed. The result shows that such a system might well be based on rules rather than on an extensive dictionary. Furthermore a useful tool in speech synthesis work is described (i.e. a programming language)."
"Summary form only given, as follows. In the recent years, considerable effort has been expended in determining a quantitative measure of fatigue, and various attempts to correlate psycilological measures with fatigue have not been successful. In this paper, a positive correlation between quantitative characteristics of speech data and fatigue measures is shown to exist. Since both the motor and speech actions of the human brain are directly affected by physical fatigue, although varying from person to person, a voice technique is shown to be the most natural and personalized method to measure fatigue."
 "Recent improvements in a system for speech synthesis from ordinary English (Coker, Umeda & Browman, Au-21, 1973, 293-298) include: (i) more accurate timing rules, based on extensive measurements of natural speech (see Umeda); (2) extended rules for allophonic variation as a function of word- and other boundaries; (3) extensive low-level (usually compensatory) adjustments in speech production --- assimilation, flaps, changes within consonant cluster, syllabic consonants, and context-dependent vowel glides; (4) a low sampling-rate model of vocal-cord and noise excitation. We summarize these, paying particular attention to items (3) and (4)."
"The underwater acoustic propagation channel is dispersive in time, frequency, and space. The channel connecting a sound source and receiver can be modeled as a finite set of sparsely distributed scatterers with fluctuating reflection parameters. This paper examines the fluctuation characteristics of the frequency selective fading in terms of the channel transfer function for a time spread channel with random path lengths. The first and second moments of the channel transfer function are determined. The effect of path length randomness on the first and second moments of the channel transfer function is clearly separated from the effect of the nominal multipath structure. The conditions under which the coherence bandwidth of the multi-path channel is a meaningful concept are examined. All of the results can be used for the mathematically dual problem of a frequency spread channel."
"In this paper some useful techniques have been given which simplify hardware of the complex multipliers, and reduce the memory required to store Fourier coefficients in FFT processors, with particular reference to the cascade organisation. It has been shown that significant saving in hardware results if the multiplications are done in sign-magnitude form while the other processing may be in 1's complement or 2's complement arithmetic. The multiplication in the propossd manner preserves the characteristics of 1's complement or 2's complement multiplications, as the case may be. The symmetry in a unit circle has been exploited to reduce the number of coefficients needed to store from N/2 to N/8 When this scheme is adopted, it allows a further saving in memory by 4 bits/complex word. In other words the memory required by a kth stage of an N(=2n)-point cascade FFT processor, with 2b-bits complex words, is reduced from2^{n-k} \\times 2bbits to2^{n-k-2} \\times 2(b-2)bits. It has been shown that a 16-point processor does not require any coefficient storage. The coefficients needed by the first stage of the 32-point cascade FFT processor may be generated simply using few gates."
"The characterisitics and applications of a new digital processing instrument, particularly useful for speech, underwater acoustics, and noise analyses, will be described. Special emphasis was placed in the design to permit transient capture analysis, viewing of both the time function and its spectrum and the presentation of all information, together with the status of the analyzer on a built-in oscilloscope. Small size and portability have been achieved in an instrument the size of a small overnight suitcase by employing digital processing and the combination of hardware and programmed logic."
"The problem of correlation degradation resulting from the motion of a transiting target is addressed. The target is assumed to emit a narrowband signal which is remotely received by two or more signal sensors. The signal compensation controls available in correlation processing are a fixed time delay (to align the two received signals) and a fixed time scale-factor shift (to compensate for doppler difference). Although these controls have proven adequate over small integration integrals, the notion induced degradation will become increasingly severe as the coherence interval is extended. The object of the paper is to determine quantitatively the expected correlation degradation as a function of the system geometry, the signal frequency, the correlation integration time and the nature and characteristics of the target track. For a given system geometry, signal frequency, and anticipated notional characteristics then, an appropriate integration time can be chosen to optimize the correlation processor in some useful sense."
"In this paper, the passive sonar detection problem is considered in terms of a signal to noise model. From this model, the passive sonar equation is developed and examined. This examination considers the physical phenomena represented in the model in order that the significance and interaction of the model parameters can be understood. From this, it is seen that the sonar design engineer has limited influence in improving sonar performance because of physical limitations beyond his control. These limitations are mostly due to the variability of the target, the ocean background, and own ship noise. Several aspects of these limiting factors are discussed in terms of sonar performance in the real ocean. This is done to show that the designer must consider these limitations even though he has no control over them."
"Explicit design procedures are given for maximally flat and equal ripple lowpass and highpass transfer functions of the form H(z) = (z ± 1)q/Dn(z) , (q = 1, 2 ..... n - 1). Efficient bandpass structures are obtained directly from the realization of H(z) using the Crochiere - Penfield method. The one-multiplier lattices of Gray and Markel realize the lowpass, highpass and bandpass transfer functions with n + 1 multipliers, if q = 1. If one-multiplier lattices with ε = +1 are used in the realization, the coefficient sensitivity peaks down in the passband of the filter."
"This paper discusses a simple hybrid approach to the problems of synthesizing and analyzing harmonic spectra. Most of the attention is given to the synthesis problem but a very brief account is given of magnitude and phase analysis of harmonic spectra. The hybrid approach is shown to possess several important advantages over pure analog or pure digital techniques. The digital portion of the system computes exact values for samples of N harmonics of a fundamental frequency f0, and produces pulses whose duty cycles are exactly proportional to the sampled values. The sampling pulses are multiplexed and gate an analog switch whose output is an amplitude and pulse width modulated signal representing a weighted sum of harmonics. To eliminate aliasing of frequencies above Nfo, a low pass filter is used. The arithmetic is based on a simple harmonic sampling algorithm, and some variations are briefly discussed which can be used for phase shifting and generating subharmonics of the existing spectra. A detailed block diagram for a 16 harmonic synthesizer is given whose only active components are fourteen standard TTL integrated circuits and some op amps (for the low pass analog filter). Finally, we discuss very briefly a possible application of the system to speech synthesis."
"Mandarin was synthesized using a computer-controlled speech synthesizer. The four tones and the neutral one in the unstressed syllable were constructed by varying the pitch of the phoneme string. A passage and a list of single syllables were generated for an experiment. It was shown that subjects could hear the synthesized passage with an encouraging intelligibility score of over 70% after less than an hour of exposure to the sounds. The results also showed that the quality of the voice could be further improved by proper manipulation of the pitch."
"An equation representing the statistical variability of SONAR parameters is cast into a form allowing computation of the effects of additive interference. The technique may be applicable in cases where electronics noise, structural (platform) noise, or flow noise contribute to degradation of detection performance. The passive SONAR equation is factored to represent stochastic \"processed signal\" and \"processed noise\" terms, which are treated as independent log - normally distributed variables. A novel graphical technique computes the detection threshold penalty attributable to interference added to the two-variable process. Parametric studies are performed, characterizing detection penalty as a function of the standard deviations of the signal and noise processes."
  "This paper discusses the application of several highly systematic signal compression procedures to the digital transmission and storage of different types of redundant data. The techniques are applicable to programmable microprocessor-based communications terminals and are based on a minimax technique applied to several statistical measures of the error between the raw signal data and the reconstituted data after transmission in a compacted form. Specific applications are made to the optimization of narrowband voice transmission systems."
"A new design method designs nonrecursive digital filters directly from maximum and minimum frequency response constraints. The method will find the minimal length filter required to meet the constraints, or design a filter of any longer length desired. This latter option is helpful when there are constraints on monotonicity in certain bands or when finite word length must be considered. When the frequency response constraints are equal to the deviation of an optimal filter, the optimal filter is designed. If the constraints are loosened, a choice of many filter designs is available."
"A technique is presented for improving the bandwidth throughout which a radar return can be detected while keeping the ground-clutter power rejection below an acceptable level. The processor employs a high-pass digital filter which has been designed in accordance with the McClellan-Parks algorithm with the pass-band lower edge selected in an optimum fashion when the other filter design parameters are specified. Conventional approaches to the design of a moving-target indicator (MTI) filter such as the three-pulse canceller and the covariance design method typically improve the signal-to-noise ratio over less than 50% of the range between dc and the pulse-repetition frequency whereas this technique extends the usable bandwidth to 80% or more. A design example is included which utilizes parameter values from a C-band radar and demonstrates the interactive influence of such filter parameters as the number of weights, passband ripple and bandedge, and stopband attenuation and cut-off."
"Summary form only given, as follows. This paper describes a new modular speaker recognition system consisting of a set of real-time speech analysis processors and a pattern recognition software package. Within a government sponsored research project, combinations of different speech analysis procedures and different pattern recognition algorithms are compared in order to find optimal subsystems, to be applied to security systems or law enforcement, for given boundary conditions. In order to find the influence of different techniques, distance measures, quantisation band distortions on the recognition rate of given data base (2,500 utterances), a study has been carried out, results of which are being discussed."
"From these studies, it is possible to model the fundamental frequency (F0) contours for sentences which exhibit a comprehensive range of linguistic communicative functions, and thus extend the understanding of the role of F0 from simple declarative sentences to a class which more nearly typifies the utterances found in nornsl discourse. Any attempt to characterize discourse-length utterances must account for these factors, and it is felt that the use of language functions within a speech act framework provides an insightful means to account for these F0 phenomena."
"We believe that the filtering problem for a digital local exchange is best studied by division into two parts. The quantisation noise filter design entails a trade-off between this filter and the type of coder. The complexity of the bandlimiting filter to achieve the CCITT specification is divided between the analogue prefilter and the second part of the digital filter. Several designs of digital filter are described which may be suitable for large scale integration."
"A speech processing system named SPAC (SPlicing of AutoCorrelation function) is proposed in order to compress or expand the speech spectrum, to prolong or shorten the duration of utterance, and to reduce the noise level in speech signal. A period of short-time autocorrelation function is sampled and spliced after change of the time scale. Transformed speech is quite natural and free from distortion. Applications of SPAC are expected in many fields such as improvement of speech quality, narrow band transmission, communication aid for hard of hearing, information service for blind, unscrambling of helium speech, stenography and so on."
"Coherent optical systems have been employed in many configurations for the spectral analysis of signal waveforms. With some systems, signal time-bandwidth products approach 107, and real time or near real time analysis is now common. We describe here methods for obtaining frequency-variant time and frequency resolution with a coherent optical spectrum analyzer and for displaying signal spectral content vs. arbitrary functions of frequency. These methods greatly enhance the applicability of optical systems to specific spectral analysis problems, A constant proportional bandwidth-log frequency system is considered as an example. Applications to frequency-mapping signal processing are also discussed."
"In this report the clutter rejection performance of a range-ambiguous MTI and doppler filter system is analyzed. The reduction of correlation time in a range-ambiguous system in general improves the clutter rejection performance. However, due to the fold-over phenomenon, a far-away target has to compete with the near-in clutter; hence, a higher improvement factor is required. Examples presented here which take into account these effects show that the improvement factor of a range-ambiguous MTI system is slightly better than that of a range-unambiguous system. However, the performance of a doppler filter processor in a range-ambiguous system is worse."
"The five lists of the Fairbanks Rhyme Test were presented to the better ear of twelve teenagers with bilateral, congenital, moderate to profound sensorineural hearing losses, at 20 dB above their speech reception thresholds. Analysis of the recognition scores revealed that the /s/ score of 69% was the highest. The average score for /d/ and /t/ of 48% was almost double the average score for /b/ and /p/ of 26%. The relatively high scores for /s/, /d/, and /t/, and low scores for /b/ and /p/ are different from what one would expect on basis of subjects' audiograms in relation to acoustic energy in these consonants."
"The present studies are an initial part of a project, the aim of which is development of a cutaneous communication aid for those born profoundly deaf or who become profoundly deaf before acquiring speech and language. A vocoder-type speech analyzer was interfaced to the tactile and visual displays of an Optacon (a reading aid for the blind) so that a time-varying spectral representation of the acoustic signal was displayed. In the production studies, 12 profoundly deaf children, 2-4 years old, were divided into three groups. Progress was assessed in terms of relative frequency of CV production. The group using the visual display and the group using the tactile display showed significant progress. The control group showed no progress. In perception studies adults served as subjects. They were trained and tested on identification of 1) duration, 2) vowels, and 3) spondee words. The tasks were increasingly difficult in the order named. Subjects showed gradual improvement during six weeks of training."
"Ferrite and ceramic transducers are considered. The purpose of the paper is to develop chain matrices and equivalent circuits, based on material constants and mounting parameters for frequencies from 0 to ∞. The limits of validity of the conventional schemes are outlined, taking into account the internal impedance of signal generators. The mathematical relation between magnetostriction and pie-zomagnetism is developed. Longitudinal vibration of cylindrical bars are dealt with. Formulas for vibrating bars with the electrical terminals open and short circuited are developed, as well as vibrations with electrical excitation. Pratical considerations conclude."
"A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is derived for determining time delay between two signals observed in the presence of uncorrelated noise, under the assumptions of known signal and noise spectral characteristics. This ML estimator can be realized as a pair of receiver prefilters followed by a cross correlator. The time argument at which the correlator achieves a maximum is the delay estimate. Qualitatively, the role of the prefilters is to weight the signal passed to the correlator according to the strength of the coherence function. Other realizations of the ML processor are also discussed. The variance of a generalized correlation time delay estimator is derived when the estimate is in the neighborhood of the true delay. An example using these results is given with emphasis on the effect of erroneously specifying the frequency weighting to be employed. Limitations of the derived results are also discussed."
"IMD of 8 hearing aids was studied. Results show the inconsistent impression due to varying signal characteristics and references."
"Recent experiments in speech synthesis have shown, that by an appropriate eigenvector analysis, a set of orthogonal parameters can be obtained that is essentially independent of all linguistic information across an analyzed utterance but highly indicative of the identity of the speaker. The orthogonal parameters are formed by a linear transformation of the linear prediction parameters, and can achieve their recognition potential without the need of any time normalization procedure. The speaker discrimination potential of the linear prediction orthogonal parameters were formally tested in both a speaker recognition and a speaker verification experiment. The speech data for these experiments consisted of six repetitions of the same sentence spoken by 21 male speakers on six separate occasions. For both recognition and verification, the identification accuracy of the orthogonal parameters exceeded 99%. In a separate text-independent speaker recognition experiment, an accuracy of 94% was achieved."
"Quest for new speaker dependent features is a constant problem in the design of automatic speaker recognition systems. In speech, information about the speaker usually arises along with the semantic information which makes its independent use difficult. In this paper, a method based on linear prediction (LP) analysis is described which yields features that are more speaker dependent than the usual linear predictor coefficients (LPC). In this method the LPC contours are obtained through cascade realization of digital inverse filtering (DIF) for speech signals. A low order (2-4) DIF removes the gross spectral characteristics such as the large dynamic range and some significant peaks which tend to mask the weaker formants. Visual comparison of the contours and a preliminary statistical analysis indicate that the LPC contours obtained by processing the output signal of the first stage contain better features for speaker dependency than the direct LPC contours."
"An efficient algorithm is presented for ordering the sections of a cascade structure digital filter in such a way as to minimize the output noise power due to internal multiplier roundoff error. The algorithm is applicable to either recursive or non-recursive filters, and is not limited to a particular section form or method of intersection scaling. Computation time estimates are given for recursive filters as a function of order. Implications of the technique relative to the theory of dynamic programming are discussed."
"The problem of detecting target signals in an ocean environment using active sonar is complicated by the non-stationary background which usually consists of both ambient ocean noise and reverberation. In the present paper, a signal processing system capable of detecting a signal in nonstationary noise is introduced. This system makes use of the mean and variance time functions of the nonstationary noise background in order to design estimation filters which will cope with the nonstationarity. Appropriate statistics of the noise and signal (tone burst) plus noise have been obtained and are used to determine the probabilities of false alarm and detection and the receiver operating characteristics."
"This paper presents new results characterizing the statistical properties of under-water acoustic ambient noise fields. The acoustic output of a single hydrophone in the 75-200 Hz. band is analyzed to obtain quantitative measures of the noise power fluctuations as a function of frequency and time. This analysis demonstrates the nonstationarity of the noise power in .78 Hz bands. In addition, the correlation between the noise power fluctuations in .78 Hz. bands is shown as a function of time and frequency separation of the bands. The fluctuations appear to consist of a slow broad-band power increase and a smaller amplitude fluctuation process which has small correlation across frequency and time."
"We present new techniques for the measurement of pitch period and formant frequencies. Individual pitch periods are estimated by finding local maxima in the power spectrum averaged over a frequency band that includes a formant. A spectral analysis is then performed for each pitch period over a data interval that is of shorter duration than the estimated pitch period. The pitch synchronous spectral analysis followed by post detection smoothing - preferably carried out over both time and frequency - leads to a spectrogram from which formant trajectories can be estimated by simple algorithms."
"An algorithm to estimate formant frequencies and amplitudes has been developed to provide control signals for a parallel formant speech synthesizer. During voiced sounds power spectra are derived by Fourier analysis of speech samples in the closed glottis regions but for unvoiced sounds spectra are derived with appropriate time averaging. Each power spectrum is matched trying several different allocations of formants to spectral peaks. An analysis-by-synthesis procedure iteratively updates the formant frequencies and amplitudes for each allocation. The final choice from these formant parameters is made every 10 ms, and depends on both spectral match and speech-like constraints."
"A normal-mode method, suitable for practical calculations of transmission loss, is developed for the propagation of underwater sound in a channel with environmental parameters that depend gradually on range, by employing an adiabatic separation of the wave equation. Results are illustrated using a parabolic sound velocity profile which opens up with increasing range."
"Summary form only given. The paper gives a solution of the problem of separating n speakers observed by m microphons by modelling the n speakers as a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system. The paper demonstrates that for separation there is the requirement m = n, not surprisingly, shows the limitations of machine analysis in the cocktail party situation m = 2, gives an algorithm with results for the example m = n = 2 and comments on some applications of the method in conference telephony, speaker position measurement etc."
"A serial-data pipeline multiplier was designed and implemented in p-channel silicon-gate MOS. It uses a radix-4 Booth algorithm for two's complement compatibility. The circuit is modular, and is configured to multiply one data word by two coefficient words simultaneously."
"Traditionally, the nost important military use of underwater sound has been the detection of subnarines at as great a distance as technology and costs will allow (sonar). Nowadays, these distances are as great as hundreds of miles for passive sonars, utilizing the noise radiated by the target, and tens of niles for active sonars, utilizing echoes from their targets. Detection ranges of these nagnitudes require the naxinun state-of-the-art enployment of techniques in signal processing, array designs and displays. The purpose of this paper is to show that these techniques are limited - in their possible gains and their degree of sophistication - by the peculiar and disadvantageous peculiarities of the ocean medium. These characteristics are the result of the presence of multipaths in the ocean - that is, the fact that there is always nore than one ray path between source and receiver. Here, some of the consequences of multipath propagation in deep water will be pointed out, and the limitations imposed on processing and the gain of arrays will be mentioned."
"Voice data entry for industrial applications has reached a significant milestone - more than 100 terminals have been installed in practical operational systems. A new low-cost speech terminal recently has been introduced which replaces or complements intelligent CRT/keyboard stations by enabling the user to enter data by voice. This Threshold 500 terminal permits source data entry directly by personnel whose hands and/or eyes are already occupied in their normal work requirements. Because of the terminal's modular design, only a display and a small operator console are required at each work station. This paper reviews the history of the predecessor equipment -the VIP-100 - discusses operational considerations for practical speech recognition systems, and describes the new Threshold 500 terminal."
"The Solution of the sonar equation for wideband echo-ranging systems requires the use of Urick's generalized form of the sonar equation, and necessitates laborious computation of many frequency-dependent quantities in the equation. The solution has been automated using standard digital computer techniques, and results in a frequency-range contour map from which the echo-to-interference ratio can be seen. The fundamental use of the solution is to assess the effectiveness of proposed target strength experiments with a variety of source, receiver, and operational parameters. However, with the addition of detection thresholds, the solution can map out a frequency-range detection contour. Examples are presented to illustrate the (known) poor performance of omnidirectional sources and receivers, and begins with the use of a SUS explosive sound source. The example continues by demonstrating the improvements which may be achieved by the addition of receiving directivity, and concludes with the analysis of a measurement system using another impulsive sound source, Hydroshock(R). This system can effectively measure submarine target strength throughout the entire sonar and weapon frequency ranges in a single experiment. The paper alse reviews Urick's generalized sonar equation, which equates the echo energy to the total interference energy both of which are received in a specific frequency and time window."
"The degrading characteristics of synthetic speech, such as minimum phase effects, pitch and voicing errors, and spectral distortions are more evident when the speech is listened to on headphones than when heard in a room over a loudspeaker. Listening to monaural sound in a room over a loudspeaker differs from headphone listening in two major respects: one, a different sound source is presented to each ear (binaural reproduction); and two, the sound source is altered by the room's acoustics, (reverberation). This paper describes a technique for including the effects of binaural reverberation on synthetic speech heard on headphones. To achieve this effect, the impulse response of a 20' × 20' classroom was first measured by applying an electrical pulse to a loudspeaker and recording the resulting room-loudspeaker impulse response as measured by two microphones spaced the ears' distance apart. These impulse responses were then convolved with the speech and played through each headset channel. Results demonstrate that this process not only suppresses the characteristic distortions of the synthetic speech, but also externalizes the sound source giving the effect of non-headphone listening."
"A technique for detecting power cable fault is described. The cable faults are usually characterized by degradation of the dielectric, either by water inclusion or physical cracking and associated voids. Voltage reflected at the fault is modeled as distorted echo. In this technique, a voltage step test signal propagates down the line and reflects energy when a change in impedance occurs. Digitized samples are taken along the return waveform. The power cepstrum of the data is then computed; a simple echo of delay τ produces a ripple in the cepstrum domain of quefrency τ yielding information about the fault location."
"Three techniques for processing parallel sonar outputs are individual processors for each output, summing all parallel outputs for use in one processor, and selecting the maximum (peak) value of the parallel outputs for use in one processor. An analysis is made of the detection sensitivity of each technique as a function of the number of parallel outputs and the amount of signal integration. The results show that the peak selection technique provides a substantial savings in processing equipment and reduces sonar display requirements compared to the individual processor technique and provides enhanced detection sensitivity compared to the summation technique."
"Voice response systems based on vocoders have the advantage of a large vocabulary, but they are expensive, since conventional vocoders cannot be multiplexed due to the energy stored in their resonance circuits. This drawback has been overcome by our new \"megahertz-vocoder\" which has formant circuits tuned to frequencies 512 times higher than natural. Short segments of speech are synthesized in 1/512 real time and stretched in time afterwards by means of an analog shift register. Since the vocoder is used only 1/512 of time it can synthesize speech for several hundred different channels. The software necessary to control the megahertz-vocoder is the same as that for the standard one."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The paper deals with the application of linear prediction technique to the speech synthesis of both italian and german languages by Standard Speech Reproducing Units (SSRU), it is by combining elementary speech segments of standardized charac teristics extracted fron utterances of native speakers. The nain feature of the method presented is the possibility of synthesizing in a higly intelligible form any nessage of such languages with a very limited amount of data. So far the use of linear predictive coding of the previously realized SSRU sets allowed a memory occupation less than 16 kb for the synthesis of italian language and less than 32 k-bytes for the combined synthesis of italian and german languages. The data flow rate is about 1 kb/s. A key property of the code with respect to methods previously used (i.e. simple concatenation of original segments ) relies in the possibility of greatly enhancing the naturalness of the synthesized speech by varying pitch, amplitude and duration of the synthetic segments. Further, the quantitative rules obtained for generating the SSRU's are expected to be useful, at least as a preliminary investigation tool, for synthesis-by-rule."
"Resynthesizing speech in an LPC-vocoder is time consuming and hardly possible in real time. This paper describes efforts to resynthesize the speech wave by means of a digital hardware speech synthesizer (Rockland). For that purpose a set of five formants have to be calculated from the inverse filter. Special attention will be given to the continuity of individual formant tracks, in order to avoid transiet phenomena in the digital formant circuit."
"A computer controlled laboratory for audio research is described. The foundation of the system is a control module operating asynchronously to the computer and a Tri-State bus line to which laboratory modules may be connected. The bus line contains 16 bi-directional data lines and addressing and control lines. The system is flexible enough to allow rapid computer checkout of prototype devices which inevitably evolve in the context of research. The system may also operate as a multi-channel digital record and playback system. The presently utilized 12-bit, 10kHz A/D and D/A modules are described and system noise problems are discussed."
"A wearable twenty-channel electrotactile vocoder was used to transform audio speech stimuli into tactile patterns via a linear display on the abdomen, analogous to a frequency-to-spatial transform with increased resolution in the F2 region. A two-choice discrimination task, with simultaneous auditory and tactile feedback, was used to train and test hearing subjects on the tactile discrimination of monosyllabic words having minimal phonemic differences. In subsequent studies, the perception of words embedded in sentences and in connected discourse was tested. Results, and implications for the processing of speech information via the tactile mode, will be discussed."
"The need of primary radar's adaption into an automatic control system has led to the development of various anti-clutter techniques to provide high and reliable detectability in heavy clutter conditions. (1) However, the techniques mainly based on MTI canceller still have inherent limitations, such as inadequate improvement of detection in a moving clutter and heavy ground clutter and deterioration of the MTI detection probability of a target flying tangentially toward the radar. To improve these limitations, this paper discusses a new clutter rejection system - discrete Fourier transform cascaded by a plane average-subtract processing unit. The method is based on frequency discrimination and utilization of difference of spatial spread between targets and clutters."
"Digital signal processing has some significant advantages in analysis of vibration and sound data. The authors have assembled a multiple channel vibration and sound data acquisition and analysis system that includes FM radio telemetry capability. The FM multichannel recorder of the data acquisition link is interfaced with a large digital computer through a digital waveform recorder and minicomputer. Signal processing is accomplished with software that provides for analysis in both the time and frequency domains. The system components are described. The capability of digital signal processing in cross spectral analysis and in the separation of random and periodic components of signals is discussed. Results of such analyses for truck tire vibration and sound signals are presented."
"A new feature extraction technique designed specifically for the mass screening problem is presented. It is based on the hypothesis that feature values from the normal class tend to form a cluster while those from the abnormal class fall outside this cluster, or \"decluster\". While some feature extraction techniques attempt to retain the fidelity of the data from which the features arose, the new technique is designed to enhance the discrimination between the normal and abnormal classes. Results from applying the new algorithm to the mass screening of breast thermograms to detect breast cancer are discussed."
"This paper introduces a modified linear prediction method based on the Karhumen-Loeve expansion of the correlation matrix of the speech samples. This result is obtained via a new normalization of the parameters. It is shown that, due to some important properties of Toeplitz matrices, the poles of the A. R. model lie on the unit circle. Consequently, only the formant frequencies are computed and the result can be interpreted as a special discrete Fourier transform. Application to speech analysis is developped with a comparison to the usual linear prediction and ceptrum methods."
 "This paper presents a new formulation for linear prediction, which we call the covariance lattice method. The method is viewed as one of a class of lattice methods which guarantee the stability of the all-pole filter, with or without windowing of the signal, with finite wordlength computations, and with the number of computations being comparable to the traditional autocorrelation and covariance methods. In addition, quantization of the reflection coefficients can be accomplished within the recursion for retention of accuracy in representation."
"A great deal of current research in the area of narrowband digital speech compression makes use of the Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) algorithm to extract the vocal track spectrum. This paper describes a technique that splits the spectrum into two equal halves and performs a piecewise LPC approximation to each half. By taking advantage of the classical benefits of piecewise approximation, the fidelity is expected to be higher than standard LPC. In addition, by making use of under-sampling and spectrum folding, computational requirements are reduced by about 40%. PLPC has been implemented in real time on the CSP-30 computer at the Speech Research and Development Facility of the Communications Security Engineering Office (DCW) at ESD."
"This research has resulted in the development of a new pitch-synchronous analysis technique for the extraction of accurate formant information from speech signals. The method is an improvement over current methods of analysis in terms of accuracy and temporal resolution. This is achieved by extension of the signal from one pitch period into the next, using a speech production model based on linear prediction. The result is higher accuracy in the determination of formant frequencies, bandwidths and amplitudes, and the ability to follow rapid formant transitions. The method performs equally well with nasal and high pitched sounds. The method is applied to the speech recognition and the speaker identification problems."
"This paper examines the properties of fixed-point multiplication errors for sign-magnitude (SM), two's-complement (TC), and one's-complement (OC) binary number representations. The mappings from the multiplier input values onto the corresponding roundoff and chopping error values are derived. Periodic error patterns are shown to exist as the multiplier input is stepped sequentially through all possible positive and all possible negative values. These patterns are dependent on the multiplication coefficient value as well as the polarity of the multiplier input. The coefficient dependent parameter ν is defined and the relation to the patterns is shown to be the following. As the multiplier input ranges over all possible positive values, a set S+ of 2νdistinct error values results. A set S- of 2νdistinct error values also results as the input ranges over all possible negative values. However, S+ overlaps completely with S- only for the TC case. Partial overlap occurs in all the other cases. Previous work is referenced to show that, under certain conditions, the probability of occurrence of each error value within the set Sαapproaches the value 2-νPαwhere Pαis the probability of occurrence of the set Sαand α = ±. The statistical error models can be represented in two ways: first as uniformly distributed white noise plus a constant for TC; second as uniformly distributed white noise plus a constant plus a hard-clipper output for the other number representations. The hard-clipper input is connected to the multiplier input. In all cases the white noise is zero-mean with variance equal to (1-2-2ν)2-2M/12 where M is the multiplier output word length."
 "Summary form only, as given. The evolution of amplifiers will be put in perspective by starting with vacuum valve designs. The cost of gain stages kept valve amplifiers out of transient interncdulation distortion. The low cost of gain stages, and later of integrated circuit operational amplifiers, led to the use of large amounts of negative voltage feedback to reduce The:enin's impedance and distortion of output transistors. The result was transient intermodulation distortion which sounds much worse than the device non-linearity the feedback was intended to reduce. Practical bounds on gain within each feedback loop will be given as a basis of the amp1ifiers contribution to the distortion budget."
"In ordinary linear prediction the speech spectral envelope is modeled by an all-pole spectrum. The error criterion employed guarantees a uniform fit across the whole frequency range. However, we know from speech perception studies that low frequencies are more important than high frequencies for perception. Therefore, a minimally redundant model would strive to achieve a uniform perceptual fit across the spectrum, which means that it should be able to represent low frequencies more accurately than high frequencies. This is achieved in the LPCW vocoder: an LPC vocoder employing our recently developed method of linear predictive warping (LPW). The result is improved speech quality for the same bit rate."
"Noise exposure is a critical problem in urban and suburban communities. In many cases noise is not considered by local agencies responsible for land use planning and zoning. This may be due in part to the difficulty in applying the more sophisticated noise criteria. An event-related noise criterion is suggested for use by communities with limited resources. Comparisons are made with standards in common use."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The distortion characteristics of microphones, recorders, amplifiers, and, loudspeakers will be cross-compared to arrive at a distortion budget. Better valve and, transistor anDlifiers make a negligible contribution to this budget. Loudspeakers can be (but usually are not) better than the tape recorder and this looks like the frontier for distortion reduction. Iethods for distortion measurement of each of the system two-ports will be d.iscussed. The characteristics and use of the human hearing system will be emphasized. A demonstration will be given to illustrate the ideas of this session."
"A comparison of reflection coefficient, log area and inverse sine quantization is presented. The approach makes use of analytically tractable results without numerical approximations or direct frequency domain calculation. By using parameters obtained from a speech data base, specific bit allocations are obtained which insure that a prescribed maximum spectral deviation is not exceeded for each analysis frame. It is shown that overall, inverse sine quantization requires the minimum number of coding levels followed by log area quantization and then reflection coefficients. With the exception of the first two coefficients, however, the differences among the methods are shown to be rather minimal."
"This paper considers distance measures for determining the deviation between two smoothed short-time speech spectra. Since such distance measures are employed in speech processing applications that either involve or relate to human perceptual judgment, the effectiveness of these measures will be enhanced if they provide results consistent with human speech perception. As a first step, we suggest Flanagan's results on difference limens for formant frequencies as one basis for checking the perceptual consistency of a measure. A general necessary condition for perceptual consistency is derived for a class of spectral distance measures. A class of perceptually consistent measures obtained through experimental investigations is then described, and results obtained using one such measure under Flanagan's test conditions are presented."
"A fixed-memory filter is applied to the covariance solution. Linear predictor coefficients are sequentially updated on a sample-to-sample basis without requiring recalculation of the covariance values or inversion of the covariance matrix."
"SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY STUDIES WITH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN A 20 FT BY 45 FT LONG LECTURE HALL CONFIRM THE STRIKING EFFECT OF SPEECH-TO--NOISE RATIO ON INTELLIGIBILITY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF VISUAL CUES TO SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY IS ALSO SHOWN TO BE VERY CONSIDERABLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LEVEL OF AUDIBLE SPEECH AT THE RECEIVER IS NEAR THE BACKGROUND NOISE LEVEL. THE AMOUNT OF IMPROVEMENT IN SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY IS SHOWN TO DEPEND UPON THE ILLUMINATION LEVEL ON THE SPEAKER AND THE DISTANCE FROM THE SPEAKER."
"The National Research Council of Canada has established an infrasonic microphone array near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to detect acoustic waves generated by large meteors during their entry into the atmosphere. The system consists of four ceramic microphones modified for an extended low-frequency response and fitted with noise-reducing pipes, and involves the sending of FM signals over telephone lines to a local telemetry station, followed by digital data transmission to a recording centre. A microprocessor is used for data-handling and magnetic tape control. The system has a peak sensitivity at 0.1 Hz, a full-scale range ± 15 microbar, and a resolution of 0.125 microbar."
"This paper describes the real time implementation of a Linear Predictive Coding algorithm that has been developed over the past five years. The algorithm chosen for the analyzer is a modification of the Covariance Method introduced by B. S. Atal [1],[2] of Bell Labs. The system for pitch extraction uses a minimum distance function correlation technique. A dynamic programming algorithm [3] is used for pitch smoothing and correction of isolated pitch errors. The synthesizer uses a transversal filter. Considerable time has been devoted to optimizing the running time and integer scaling of the different algorithms for real time implementation on a 16 bit mini-computer."
"The grammars are proposed which generate all possible reference signals of speech using a finite number of elementary reference signals and a finite system of rules. These grammars take into account the essential factors of variability of speech signals: coarticulation of sounds, nonlinear change of the rate and the intensity of pronouncing. The recognition of a shown speech signal consists in finding among all reference signals one which has the greatest resemblance to the shown signal and indicating the sequence of phonemes, syllables or words that corresponds to this reference signal. The recognition problem is solved by using the dynamic programming method. The learning consists in evaluating the parameters of the grammars: alphabet of elementary reference signals, acoustic-phonetic transcriptions of words and so on. Some algorithms for speech recognition are proposed: recognition of words, recognition of connected speech composed from the words of a finite vocabulary, speech recognition by phonemes without vocabulary restriction, recognition of words and phrases by phonemes. Good experimental results were obtained for all algorithmes."
"Initial word reference signals are built from the finite set of the reference elements and written by means of acoustic-phonetic transcription. The transformations of the initial word references permitting to obtain reference signals of words with the different rate of pronunciation are introduced. Reference phrase signals are composed of reference word signals with the help of special rules. The recognition of a given signal consists in location of the reference signal of a maximum likelihood for the given one and in indication of a word or a word sequence which composes it. Learning algorithm, which finds the transcriptions of words and the set of reference elements allows to adapt to some announcer and to change some part of the dictionary or the whole one. Described method of a recognition gives 1% of errors, 3% of refusals for 300 words. The word recognition in connected speech gives 3% of errors and 7% of refusals."
 "This paper gives a description of a syntactic analyzer, which is used for continuous speech recognition. After the words have been located in a sentence by a lexical analyzer, the syntactic analyzer makes a bottom-up parsing, evaluating all the possible solutions, according to a context-free grammar. The analyzer has been designed to make up for some errors which had occured in the phonemic analysis, such as the omission or the insertion of phonemes, resulting in an inadequate segmentation of the words in a sentence. It also allows in some cases to complete sentences for which a word is missing. We have tested the program on a hundred sentences from simple languages (vocabularies of 50 to 100 words) : the present version of the analyzer allows the recognition of up to 50-60% of the sentences. It only takes a few seconds to analyze a sentence."
"This report presents results obtained in some experiments on the computer recognition of continuous speech. The experiments deal with two simple languages having vocabularies of 11 and 250 words."
"The development of 4 channel home entertainment systems has been motivated by the marketplace and accomplished without a thorough engineering feasibility study. One area of promise has not been exploited while four areas of foolishness have been propagated. As a result, the author's answer to the title question is \"yes.\""
"This paper describes a connected speech understanding system being implemented in Nancy, thanks to the work done in automatic speech recognition since 1968. This system is made up of four parts : an acoustic recognizer which gives a string of phoneme-like segments from a spoken sentence, a syntactic parser which controls the recognition process, a word recognizer working on words predicted by the parser and a dialog procedure which takes in account semantic constraints in order to avoid some of the errors and ambiguities. Some original features of the system are pointed out : modularily (e.g. the language used is considered as a parameter), possibility of processing slightly syntactically incorrect sentences, ... The application both in data management and in oral control of a telephone center has given very promising results. Work is in progress for generalizing our model : extension of the vocabulary and of the grammar, multi-speaker operation, etc."
 "Establishing phase and shading for long focused arrays at high frequencies in acoustic test pools presents numerous problems. Conventional methods for using a plane wave produced by placing projectors in the far field or using collimators proves difficult to align and becomes expensive. A novel solution has been developed by the Naval Coastal Systems Laboratory. The approach employs an apparatus which is attached directly to the face of the array and measures the phase and sensitivity of each element of the array in the laboratory, without utilizing a transducer test pool."
"A new method has been employed in order to reduce the loss of relevant information while converting digital sound spectrograms into their two-level representations. The method involves a threshold which is adaptively adjusted in time as well as in frequency. When compared with other reported attempts, the resulting binary spectrograms yield much more reliable indications of formants, formant transitions, turbulences, bursts, etc. Moreover, a feasible digital hardware solution of a simplified matrix processor is shown to be sufficient for the real-time computation of the binary spectrograms."
"The design for a convolution processor is presented, which employs a single highly parallel implementation of the FFT algorithm. This processor is eminently suited for real-time matched filtering of linear FM (LFM) signals encountered in sonar systems. Computer simulations have shown that this processor, which uses fixed point arithmetic and modest word sizes can efficiently handle signals with multiple targets and relatively large doppler shifts. The parallel architecture provides a throughput rate sufficient for computing both forward and inverse transforms in the one processor. This retains for the system the flexibility for frequency domain adaptive beamforming, attractive in many sonar applications."
"Parameter or feature extraction from speech signal forms the basis for systems designed for speech recognition, speaker verification, speech bandwidth compression etc. The parameters in general are critically dependent upon the short-time spectrum of speech. The input speech waveform is however, subjected to several types of noises and distortions due to background noise sources, reverberation, close speaking into a microphone, telephone system imperfections etc. These factors modify the spectrum of the speech signal and hence the parameters extracted. Characteristics of common sources of noise and distortion are described in this paper and their effect in shaping the spectrum of speech is discussed. Steps to reduce the influence of some noises while producing speech input to a system are suggested. Methods of normalization of spectral distortions due to noise and the effect of such normalization on parametric extraction are also discussed."
"A ship-positioning sonar system repeatedly experienced severe problems while operating in rough seas. The visual display for this system is a CRT screen with a bright spot that represents the position of an undersea beacon relative to a fixed point on the ship in the X-Y plane parallel to the sea surface. In operation, the bright spot is manipulated to the center of the screen by moving the ship in a compensating direction, the object being to keep the vessel stationary directly over the beacon. Difficulties in performance arose when the seas became very rough. The bright spot jumped erratically and sometimes took excursions off the screen entirely. This left the operator very uncertain of the ship's position and caused a general loss of confidence in the system. At first the problem was thought to be a malfunction of the hardware that manifested itself when the ship pitched and rolled severely. However, a careful analysis of test data showed that the problem originated in the transmission medium itself. Because of the rough seas, aerated patches of water were introduced into the signal path between the beacon and the receiving hydrophones beneath the hull. The presence of this aerated water reduced the phase velocity and increased the attenuation of the beacon signal, accounting for the erratic behavior on the sonar display."
 "The process of speech production is approximated by an autoregressive moving-average process described by a state equation and an observation equation. The state transition matrix that characterizes the autoregressive part is determined to minimize the mean squared error in the estimation of the speech waveform by Kalman filtering. The Matrix and the autocorrelation function of the signal are used to determine the moving-average parameters. These parameters are then used to obtain the optimum number and the values of poles and zeroes of the speech power spectrum. Applications of the method to noise-stripping and pitch extraction are also discussed."
"Loudspeaker systems may be designed using modern synthesis techniques to meet specific realizable performance goals. The central task in this process is the synthesis of the required driver parameters and the physical realization of the driver."
"Several advanced voice modems for aero communications were installed in a specially equipped FAA KC-135 aircraft and tested with an L-band signal from the NASA Rosman ground station via the NASA ATS-6 spacecraft. Tabulated and plotted data are presented."
 "The acoustical circuit of a loudspeaker in a vented box or in a closed box, approximates closely, over its piston range, to a high-pass filter of fourth-order or second-order respectively. The component values of the filter can easily be measured in a form suitable for analysis using readily available electrical measuring equipment and an enclosure of known volume. From this data, loudspeaker systems can be synthesized as filters, using composite structures containing both acoustical elements and electrical elements such as equalizers. These structures can be optimised for a desired response or for minimum box size or amplifier power or maximum power capability or a compromise between all these factors. Design considerations and methods are outlined for arriving at these optima."
"The speech quality of present day analysis-synthesis telephony systems is not sufficiently acceptable for many purposes. One cause of this is inaccuracies in the approximations to the spectral envelope of the speech signal. This paper describes an investigation into a method of approximating the spectral envelope with a filter transfer function represented by the ratio of two polynomials. Each polynomial is described by a set of log area ratios and an iterative procedure is used to determine the values of these parameters which minimize a suitable error measure. A 2400 bit/s speech transmission system which uses pole-zero approximations to the spectrum has been simulated."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The theory developed by Small points out the need for determining the displacement volume of a loudspeaker driver. Methods I or measuring displacement volume will be given. The contribution from suspension non-linearity will be shown to be of minor importance. Non-linearity in the driving motor will be related to the resulting amplitude modulation distortion."
"The old cut and try methods of direct radiator loudspeaker system development have been minimized by the recent work of Australians Thiele, Small, and Benson. The operation of systems in the so-called low-frequency piston range where the wavelength is larger than the radiator is now quite predictable and predetermined. The Australians have contributed substantially to the storehouse of information that can aid and direct a systems designer. Well developed theory has been made available, permitting a designer to proceed from the specification of important end goals (such as efficiency, system size, low frequency limit, and power output) to a usable system with a minimum of empirical investigation. Applications of this theory to the design of several loudspeaker systems will be discussed."
"An outline is given of the basic theory of arrays of linear configuration. This leads to a discussion of methods for achieving constant beam width over the working frequency range. Techniques used in the design of arrays employing acoustic and electrical frequency tapering are presented and their characteristics compared. Examples of recent applications of electrically tapered arrays are given, with particular reference to those developed for the Sydney Opera House."
"A method is described which applies the linear prediction directly to fundamental frequency analysis of the speech wave. Most methods hitherto proposed use the linear prediction indirectly estimating the spectral envelop. With an appropriate band-width and a number of terms, the linear prediction can be shown to estimate the spectral fine structure. The fundamental component is included among the roots of its characteristic equation. This method does not use explicit peak-picking or interpolation. Experimentally, the bandwidth is chosen between 300 - 900 Hz, and the number of coefficients 4 - 8. The method gives very accurate results without much computation, and is possibly applicable to coding the base-band of a vocoder."
"The Hearsay II speech understanding system being developed at Carnegie-Mellon University has an independent knowledge source module for each type of speech knowledge. Modules communicate by reading, writing, and modifying hypotheses about various constituents of the spoken utterance in a global data structure. The syntax and semantics module uses rules (productions) of four types: (1) recognition rules for generating a phrase hypothesis when its needed constituents have already been hypothesized; (2) prediction rules for inferring the likely presence of a word or phrase from previously recognized portions of the utterance; (3) respelling rules for hypothesizing the constituents of a predicted phrase; and (4) postdiction rules for supporting an existing hypothesis on the basis of additional confirming evidence. The rules are automatically generated from a declarative (Le., non-procedural) description of the grammar and semantics, and are embedded in a parallel recognition network for efficient retrieval of applicable rules. The current grammar uses a 450-word vocabulary and accepts simple English queries for an information retrieval system."
 "A series expansion of pitch periods is often suggested in order to reduce the information rate of speech signals. Considering speech signals that are sampled at a constant rate, this may be treated as a linear transformation of random vectors with varying length. For a constant length, it is commonly known how to determine the optimum basis vectors from the covariance matrix of the random vector. In this paper it is shown how to define and estimate a special covariance matrix which allows the determination of basis vectors that are especially suited for the expansion of variable length vectors. This expansion may be considered optimum in the sense that it has most of the favourable properties of the Karhunen-Loève transformation (KL), without being restricted to a fixed dimension of the vector space. The new expansion has been tested successfully on speech material in pitch analysis and pitch-synchronous block quantization."
"Most of the DPCM systems for speech transmission, employ a digital transversal predictor. In such a way an all-pole vocal tract model is assumed; this is not always good either for a fixed or time-varying model. To overcome this drawback some recursive-filter predictors (e.g., Kalman predictors) have been proposed, but not examined for real speech. This paper develops one of these procedures, and, by exploiting an average state-space model of the vocal tract, analyzes the system performance in the case of real voice."
"An experiment was performed to investigate: (a) the influence of PCM code parameters on subjective speech quality, (b) objective measures for predicting perceived distortions and (c) optimum combinations of code parameters. The results indicate that listener opinions depended strongly on coder clipping level and step size but only weakly on bandwidth. Clipping noise power proved a poor predictor of perceived overload distortion; clipping percentage was more useful. Granular noise power was a good predictor of granular distortion. For a given bit rate, the coder with the highest quality rating was not the one with minimum total (clipping + granular) noise power, contrary to traditional wisdom."
"The recognition system of spoken words using the restricted number of learning samples is described. The learning samples are composed of a part of the whole words to be recognized and are used to derive the reference patterns of phonemic spectrums needed in the recognition system. Four kinds of algorithms for selecting the optimum set of words constituting the learning samples are proposed and tested. Recognition test of twenty words is done for 20 speakers. By the use of a half of the twenty words as learning samples, the recognition rate of 98.6 % is obtained in the case of the optimum learning sample."
"The Speech Communications Group at SPERRY UNIVAC Defense Systems is developing a linguistically-oriented procedure for recognizing words, phrases, and natural sentences by computer. The major components of the current speech recognition system perform acoustic and phonetic analysis, phonetic segmentation, and lexical matching and scoring. The acoustic processing is based on a linear-predictive spectral analysis of the speech signal. Sounds are classified by manner, place, and voicing using formant frequencies and other spectral functions, as well as information about syllable boundaries and nuclei. A linear sequence of analysis segments is created, and matched against the lexicon using a scoring matrix that ranks analysis-lexical segment pairs by their expected confusions. Word sequences are progressively formed and ranked against the entire input to determine the most likely phrases spoken. When the recognition system was tested on a 31-word vocabulary from two male speakers, single word recognition scores of 95% correct were obtained when the task syntax was used. Preliminary results for recognizing connected word sequences from three male speakers range from 54 to 74% for a task with constrained word order. Current plans for enhancing the recognition system include the incorporation of components for phonological rules, speaker normalization, and prosodic guidelines. By adding more powerful procedures for syntactic and semantic analysis, the system will be extended from the recognition of several-word noun phrases to the understanding of more natural sentences."
"Coded speech according to a PHONOCODE, such as SOTINA, consists of words combining 3 vowel classes O (=o,u), A (=a,α), I (=i,e) and 3 consonant classes S (=s,\\int), T (=t,k), N (=n,m). Such coded words are designed to be internationally pronounceable by everybody, and immediately recognizable by a machine, such as a PHONO-DECODER. Human recognition tests (for orienting the best vowel and consonant combinations) are made: a) for French at the C.N.E.T. (Department J.-M. PERSON); b) for German, and next for English, at the University of Trier (Germany), (Phonetics Institute, J.-P. KÖSTER). Statistical results are given, depending on various telephonic conditions (noise immunity) and on initial, intermediate or final phoneme positions in the words (proximity immunity). Automatic recognition tests (for optimizing the systems) are made at the C.N.E.T.: a) with the PHONODECODER I, a machine which is in course of development (Department P.LORAND, team M.CARTIER); b) with DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (Team G.Mercier). Present statistical results are given for various words combining vowels V and consonants C, such as CVV, VCV, CVCV, pronounced by men and women, without prior adaptation of the machine to every word or speaker."
"This paper describes an implementation of a speaker independent system which can recognize connected digits. The overall recognition system consists of two separate but inter-related parts. The function of the first part of the system is to segment the digit string into the individual digits which comprise the string; the second part of the system then recognizes the individual digits based on the results of the segmentation. To evaluate the accuracy of the system in segmenting and recognizing digit strings a series of experiments was conducted. Using high quality recordings from a soundproof booth the segmentation accuracy was found to be about 99%, and the recognition accuracy was about 91% across 10 speakers (5 male, 5 female). With recordings made in a noisy computer room the segmentation accuracy remained close to 99%, and the recognition accuracy was about 87% across another group of 10 speakers (5 male, 5 female)."
"Three vocoders based on channel vocoder techniques are presented: - 2400 or 4800 bit/s channel vocoder which has 14 channels and pitch detector, -1200 or 1800 bit/s vocoder : spectral data are reduced by projection on a plane (out of eight possible) constitued with two factorial axis, - 9600 bit/s voice excited vocoder with acceptable quality up to five per cent bit error rate for the transmission. For such vocoders, digital processing will be a very attractive solution on account of using shared time processor which will provide large reduction of hard-ware. Each vocoder will be described and particularized. The second mentionned vocoder permits reduction of the binary transmission rate, in this field it can be considered as an improvement of first one. The last one uses delta modulation to transmit low frequency band of the speech and channels for upper band. It keeps acceptable quality even if bit error rate of the transmission reaches 5 per cent. For those vocoders, quality, complexity, transmission performances are given and compared."
 "This paper presents the preliminary study of a new approach to Automatic Speech Recognition using Acoustic-Phonetic analysis and Statistical Pattern Recognition techniques. Implementation of an On-Line, Adaptive, Speaker-Independent Word Recognition System is also described to illustrate the approach."
"The spaces of functions having a finite abelian group as domain and a Galois field as co-domain have found interesting application in digital signal processing: the group characters form an orthogonal basis in such a space, and the corresponding Fourier transform can be used to perform fast convolution with no computation error. This note considers the problem of optimality in designing signal processors in Galois fields; and tries to elucidate the significance of operations in the frequency domain related to the respective Galois-field Fourier transform. This is done by introducing a class of operators on the signal space such that the characters are their eigenfunctions, in the same way that the complex exponentials are the eigenfunctions of the classical newtonian differentiator. Starting from this definition (originally introduced by J.E. Gibbs in connection with the Walsh functions), we show that the harmonic differentiators thus defined have many properties in common with the classical differentiator. Applications of harmonic differential calculus to a 'harmonic' state-space analysis of finite-valued signal processors are investigated. The note also examines discrete Laplace (z-) transforms in Galois fields."
"The ability of a set of simple predicates to capture characteristic patterns in a parametric representation of vowels in continuous speech was investigated with the aid of an efficient conjunctive pattern recognition and classification system. The results compare favourably with those produced by a cluster-based minimal Euclidean distance technique, run over the identical training and test samples. The predicates used are similar to auditory receptive fields."
 "A new adaptive quantizer for speech digitization has been derived. It is similar to known adaptive quantizers in that it adjusts its dynamic range to match that of the speech waveform. In addition, it further adjusts its range to compensate for the increased signal strength that follows a pitch pulse. The new quantizer bases its adaptation on its own output and no side information is required. When combined with a variable length source coding scheme, the new quantizer offers a significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and in subjective speech quality. The technique is applicable to a broad range of digitization methods including adaptive delta modulation and various forms of ADPCM."
 "An effective method for calculating the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a double-sampled sequence (a pair of the equi-interval-sampled sequences) is presented in a matrix form. The calculation formula shows that the DFT of a certain type of band-limited signals can be effectively evaluated from the DFT's of a pair of the equi-interval-sampled sequences of the signal. It is demonstrated that the double-sampling technique in digital signal processing produces the effects similar to the beat-down in a heterodyne system of analog circuits. A calculation example is given in detail and some computational and practical applications are described briefly."
"The problem of realizing wave digital filter structures from analog two-port lossless ladder networks has been widely studied via the wave flow diagram approach by several authors during recent years. These filter structures generally exhibit low sensitivities to multiplier coefficient variations and improved roundoff noise. This paper presents a simple and systematic design procedure, based on the wave flow diagram and a bilinear transformation, whereby any Foster type LC network can be easily realized in digital circuit structures. Examples using this procedure are given. It is believed that the method described in this paper is fully practical and affords a wide vista for designing wave digital filters based on any type ladder analog filter network."
 "Experiments of vowel identification and dichotic fusion have been performed in order to investigate the condition in which two time-varing dynamic vowels would 'fuse'. Peripheral/central dichotomy of \"complementary function\" in the human auditory system between production and perception at the level of nonsense syllables has been considered by dealing with dichotic listening. Two types of stimuli, one of the form [u-Vowel-u] and the other [e-Vowel-e], were synthesized and presented dichotically to listeners. Judgment of fusion was made for the middle vowels of the stimuli. The results suggest that this kind of comprementality between production and perception of speech does not take place in peripheral auditory system."
"While there exist methods in the literature for objectively evaluating the intelligibility of speech in the presence of stationary noise, little has been done regarding the objective evaluation of either the intelligibility or the quality of vocoded speech. We present a framework within which we have begun a step-by-step program to develop objective measures for vocoded speech quality that are consistent with results from subjective tests."
"A discrete filtering technique based on the discrete Hilbert Transform (DHT) is presented. The filtering method and its implementation are shown to compare favorably with DFT and FFT filtering. The comparison is presented in terms of complexity of hardware implementation and error accumulation. The DHT itself and derived discrete filter transforms are each presented in matrix form and may be implemented with the same hardware in either series or parallel form. In this manner a large variety of filtering characteristics may be implemented by changes of the stored coefficients only. While the filtering process is a circular convolution, direct convolution filters are obtainable also, by using one row of the matrix only, and are realizable in the form of an FIR (non-recursive) digital filter."
"An expression for the output noise-to-signal ratio is derived, taking into account the correlation between the truncation errors, when fast Fourier transform is computed in fixed-point arithmetic. A few assumptions, made in the analysis, are verified by computer simulations. The output noise-to-signal ratios predicted by the new expression and the old expression (which is derived under the assumption that the truncation errors are uncorrelated) are compared with the experimental results. It is shown that the predicted values based on the new results fall short of the experimental results by atmost 22%, while those predicted by the old results fall short by as much as 135.7%."
"An adaptive inverse digital filter has been developed for formant analysis of speech using the LMS adaptive algorithm of Widrow and Hoff. The inverse filter is implemented in cascade form, as opposed to the traditional direct-form implementation of adaptive filters, which simplifies both the algorithm and the utilization of its output. The simplicity of the filter and the adaptive algorithm makes this an attractive technique for real-time hardware realization. Variations and improvements of the basic algorithm are discussed."
"The spectral distortion of speech signals, without affecting the pitch or the speed of the signal, has met with some difficulty due to the need for pitch extraction. This paper presents a general analysis-synthesis scheme for the arbitrary spectral distortion of speech signals without the need for pitch extraction. Linear predictive warping, cepstral warping, and autocorrelation warping, are given as examples of the general scheme. Applications include the unscrambling of helium speech, spectral compression for the hard of hearing, bit rate reduction in speech compression systems, and efficiency of spectral representation for speech recognition systems."
"To reduce distortion, a technique is presented for deconvolving the effect of the distorting system on a desired signal. The technique does not require any prior assumptions about the distorting system other than that it is linear and time-invariant. However, we must assume that the desired signal is a sample function from a cyelostationary (CS) random process with known statistics. Many signals of practical importance can be modelled as CS including PAM, FSK, PWM, etc. The technique utilizes inverse filtering with an estimate of the distorting system function which is obtained exclusively from the observed signal and the known and computed properties of CS processes."
"The algorithm for pitch determination presented in this paper derives pitch periods from speech signals in time domain applying a crude approximation to an inverse filter which is realized as a two-step nonrecursive digital filter. In the first step, a low-pass filter cuts off the higher formants; the second step presents a filter with a zero situated around F1. The output signal of the filter shows a structure similar to the glottal waveform with only one significant peak per pitch period. This peak is detected and marked as a preliminary pitch period limitation. In a final step, these markers are shifted into an optimum phase position. The method permits the realization as a digital on-line piece of hard-ware. The algorithm was applied to detect non-prosodic fundamental frequency dynamics in certain VCV utterances. First results of this experiment show a decrease of f0at the V-C transition which depends on the consonant in the utterance and strongly varies from speaker to speaker."
"A method is described which calculates poles to be called 'auditory formants' assuming that the number of pole pairs of auditory significance (or of higher Q factor of resonance) is three. The speech wave is first analyzed by linear prediction (LP) method with 14 (or 20) predictor coefficients. The frequency scale of the calculated power spectrum is transformed into \"mel scale\" and the amplitude is weighted according to \"equal loudness contour\". The processed power spectrum is transformed into autocorrelation function by inverse-Fourier-transform. LP-analysis is again performed to obtain three conjugate pole pairs utilizing the first six terms of the autocorrelation. The pole frequencies give the mel formant frequencies. Several experimental results are shown."
"Laryngeal control for change in voice pitch was studied by means of digital simulation of the anatomical structure model. The e.m.g.'s of five laryngeal muscles during the utterance of Japanese word accents were analyzed by an AbS method in order to obtain the underlying higher neuromotor commands. Utilizing the neuromotor commands as input, fundamental frequency contour and excurtion of laryngeal cartilages were calculated by the model and were compared with measured ones. Based on the results, correspondence between pitch change and the movement of larynx, rate of contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic laryngeal muscles to pitch change, and physiological correlates of Japanese word accents are discussed."
"In many applications of signal processing (in areas of communication, pattern recognition, measurement) it is necessary to detect (or classify) the signals in the absence of certain a priori information about its parameters. One of the effective methods of solving such problems - the Function Filtration Method - is discussed. Method of the determination of the generating equations form for the process with unknown parameters is proposed. A general approach to the design of algorithms for measurement under invariance conditions on the informationless parameters of the signal, whose instability is equivalent to noise, is given. This method allows the synthesis of highly effective filters for the elimination of signals with known function while their parameters are a priori unknown. Applications of this method are given for some special cases."
"The Sectioned Spectrum Processor is a technique for artificially extending the bandwidth of digital data acquisition systems. The processing technique, applicable to periodic waveforms, is based on successively acquiring segments of an input signal spectrum and subsequently combining them to obtain a composite spectrum. Errors associated with the acquisition of contiguous spectrum segments are estimated and shown to be consistent with simulation results."
"A highly reliable non-iterative algorithm for the detection of the closed glottis interval of voiced sounds is described. The method is based on an indicator of linear dependence of certain intervals of the speech signal that are considerably shorter than the pitch period. This indicator is evaluated using the normalized prediction error calculated by linear predictive coding applied to the integrated speech signal. The method allows for the decomposition of the speech signal into an excitation function and a signal for which the glottal impedance is constant and infinite. The algorithm has been extensively applied to the detection of a pitch period in the speech signal and to the extraction of the vocal tract area function. The potential applications of this approach include not only speech analysis and synthesis, but equally speech recognition and speaker identification."
"A rationale is advanced for digitally coding speech signals in terms of sub-bands of the total spectrum. The approach provides a means for controlling and reducing quantizing noise in the coding. Each sub-band is quantized with an accuracy (bit allocation) based upon perceptual criteria. As a result, the quality of the coded signal is improved over that obtained from a single full-band coding of the total spectrum. In one implementation, the individual sub-bands are low-pass translated before coding. In another, \"integer-band\" sampling is employed to alias the signal in an advantageous way before coding. Other possibilities extend to complex demodulation of the sub-bands, and to representing the subband signals in terms of envelopes and phase-derivatives. In all techniques, adaptive quantization is used for the coding, and a parsimonious allocation of bits is made across the bands. Computer simulations are made to demonstrate the signal qualities obtained for codings at 16 and 9.6 Kbits/sec."
 "In this paper, we discuss how adaptive predictive coders employing pitch and coefficient predictors perform when combined with adaptive multilevel quantizers to transmit speech at 16 Kb/s. Performance curves based on fixed point simulations provide a quantitative signal-to-noise analysis as a function of predictor complexity, quantizer adaptation strategy and channel error rate. For example, a fourth order adaptive predictor with pitch loop and adaptive 8-level quantization provides reconstructed speech that is perceptually indistinguishable from the original 2500 Hz band limited input. With channel errors, performance is found to be both a sensitive function of quantizer adaption strategy and predictor complexity. While complex predictors are superior to CVSD at error rates below 10-4, CVSD degrades less rapidly as channel errors increase, At 10-2BER and above, CVSD outperforms the other techniques studied."
"An online automatic spoken word recognition system has been developed for the researches on the automatic recognition of speech. In this system, the spoken word is first frequency analysed with a filter bank of single tuned low selectivity filters. Three major local peaks in the spectrum and the amplitude of the speech wave are extracted every 10 ms. The frequencies of two local peaks are used for classifying the vowels, and the frequencies of three local peaks, the movements of them and the amplitude are used for classifying the semi-vowels and consonants. Input speech is thus transformed into a sequence of the notations expressing the phonemes or phoneme groups every 10 ms. The sequence is again transformed into possible phonemic strings which are called input words henceforth and are convenient for the comparison with the contents of the dictionary. The Hamming's distance between each input word and each item of the contents of the dictionary is computed where the notations of phonemes and phoneme groups are expressed by 9 bits binary vectors. The item in the dictionary nearest to one of the input word is selected as the output of the recognition system. The experiments were carried out with the utterance of five speakers from whose utterances the standard patterns for P1, P2 and Pe3 distribution had been made. The recognition score was 96% for the 20 city names involving all kinds of phonemes. The speech samples were increased to 166 city names and 82% of the utterances of three speakers were correctly recognized by adding the possible combination of phonemes to every word. Next, 13 different speakers uttered 51 city names having long distance between each other, the recognition score was found to be 94% when the speakers were permitted to repeat their utterances for three times."
"A method for vowel recognition is proposed on the basis of the results obtained from the experiments of vowel perception. The method consists of two stages: First, the formant frequency pattern is transformed into the vowel quality represented as the coordinate on Psychological Auditory Space(PAS), which has been constructed applying Kruskal's method of multidimensional scaling. Second, the vowel is identified according as which vowel area on PAS the vowel quality belongs to. Here, the vowel identification is performed utilizing the context effect measured quantitatively by the psychological experiments. The experiment of vowel recognition was carried out using the vowels in connected speech."
"An experimental study on the formant structure of Bengali vowels uttered both in isolation and in the beginning of words has been investigated for the first time. The extraction of formant frequencies were carried out using the analysis by synthesis (AbS) method. It has been found that the formant structures of Bengali vowels uttered in isolation differ considerabely with those for English and the Japanese vowels though their sounds are alike. It has also been found that unlike the case of English and Japanese, the isolated Bengali vowels form two distinct group upon the F1-F2 plane. The effect of succeeding phonemes on the formant frequency of initial vowel of a word have also been investigated and discussed."
"A technique has been developed to locate, define the boundaries of, and appropriately label voiced and unvoiced fricative and plosive portions of a continuous speech utterance. Method and experimental results are presented."
"A model is described for the spectral characteristics of voiceless fricative consonants of Japanese, based on an equivalent circuit representation of their generation mechanism. The model, together with its three simplified versions, are then evaluated from the point of view of automatic recognition as well as of synthesis of speech. For automatic recognition, spectral models that contain zeros are found to be particularly effective, and their parameters are shown to be sufficient for the complete separation of /s/- and /\\int/- samples in CV and VCV utterances. On the other hand, perceptual experiments using synthetic stimuli reveal considerably smaller differences between models with spectral zeros and those without zeros."
"A technique has been developed to locate, define the boundaries of, and appropriately label steady-state voiced non-fricative areas of a continuous speech utterance. It uses advanced methods of pitch and formant tracking to provide the necessary acoustic parameters. The labeling algorithm compares the analyses with vowel-sonorant tables that incorporate some coarticulation phonemena based on current research. The sounds are discussed with respect to the stress of the vowels and the position of the sonorant, i.e., initial or final form. Results for four male subjects are presented."
"Earlier results have determined mathematical interrelationships between several zero-crossing analysis methods which have been applied to automatic speech recognition. In the present paper, some initial work aimed at determining the relative applicability. of these zero-crossing analysis methods for speech recognition is presented. Toward this end, two simulation studies with English vowels are described. One study is aimed at determining the relative discriminability of the methods for vowel recognition. The other study is aimed at determining the noise vulnerability of the zero-crossing analysis methods. Results of this study indicate that one of the zero-crossing methods appears to have the potential for more accurate vowel recognition than the others."
"A technique is presented for the design of stable two-dimensional recursive digital filters. The stability of the resulting filters is guaranteed, and hence repeated application of cumbersome stability tests is obviated. The transfer function of the filter is obtained from a one-dimensional prototype by applying a new transformation technique in the frequency domain. To illustrate the approach some design examples of low-pass filters are given."
 "A Markov-model acoustic-phonetic component is constructed for the synthesis of standard acoustic representations of connected speech. The primary building blocks are phones with Markov models structured so that phone length, spectral power and fundamental frequency are parametrically controlled. The model generates acoustic parameter outputs at 10-ms time steps. The acoustic-phonetic component permits matching between actual acoustic data and internally modeled acoustic data, and can be employed in various ways - to automatically label speech, as a phone decoder to obtain estimated phone strings, and in speech recognizers which match at the acoustic level."
"The grouping of acoustic segments into syllables and words reflects a structural organization similar to that found at many higher levels of linguistics. Evidence from speech perception studies indicates that the human interpretation of an acoustic segment is a function of its position in the stream of speech segments. Speech synthesis programs use segment-combination rules that depend on the manner of production classes of the constituent segments. This paper reviews considerations for use of the syntactic approach in automatic segmental analysis of speech for speech recognition applications. We find that the segmentation and labeling processes are sufficiently strongly connected to make context-independent segmentation unlikely to prove successful in practice. Voicing and manner of production are the features under strongest syntactic constraint while segments differing in place of production can be more freely substituted."
"An algorithm is described in this paper which performs spectral analysis of speech and automatic extraction of the formant frequencies from the speech spectra. It performs preliminary classification of the vowels in 'front','central' and 'back' and processes each of these subclasses according to different rules. The algorithm is programed in FORTRAN-IV IBM 360/370 version. The program was tested by the processing of 614 Bulgarin vowel sounds uttered by 60 speakers/30 male and 30 female/. The performance of the program has shown a total percent of uncorrect decisions about the values of the formant frequencies averaging to 13,25% for the male speakers and 23,60% for the female speakers."
 "Some results are presented of the use of partial inverse filtering to produce waveforms representing single formants of voiced speech. These waveforms confirm the well known fact that the main formant excitation normally occurs at glottal closure. However, there is frequently evidence of additional excitation, not only at glottal opening and during the open phase, but also after closure. The latter effect might be accounted for by air displacement resulting from small movements of the surface of the vocal folds, as often seen on high speed motion pictures of the larynx. The implications for speech analysis and synthesis are discussed."
"Speech synthesis has been performed utilizing different devices, Roughly speaking, these devices are composed of a vocal tract transfer function simulator and a glottal waveform simulator. Of course, this description is very crude and in actual realizations some features which belong to one part may be taken into account by the simulation of the other one.For instance, in mathematical analyses, the zeroes of the glottal wave are treated as belonging to the vocal tract transfer function. The result is good for analysis - synthesis experiments but improving the quality of synthetized speech using physiological features is impossible."
"The Modular Acoustic Processor (MAP), a complex experimental system for automatic derivation of phonemic string output for continuous speech, was first described in April 1974. Many of the new concepts currently in MAP are described. In particular, the problems concerning the diadic segment classification and final string estimation are discussed, and the current solutions given. Results on a large body of continuous speech data, prepared by an automatic evaluation system will also be presented."
"The problems involved in automatic recognition of continuous speech are generally considered very difficult. In an attempt to solve these problems an acoustic processing system has been under development which has stages dedicated to signal analysis, spectral classification, phonemic segmentation, phonemic (steady state) classification, phoneme boundary placement, diadic (transitional) classification, and final phoneme string consolidation. This paper presents the concepts of and some details concerning the first five stages, through phoneme boundary placement. Performance results are also presented."
"This paper aims to report a new successive procedure for obtaining a sequence of phonemic categories from acoustic speech signal. The procedure is composed of three levels, i.e., enhancement and inhibition of speech spectra (preprocessing), local peak extraction (feature extraction), and processing of dynamic properties of the feature series (categorization). Each level is composed of multistage processes whose one stage consists of two or three computational steps. The principal features of this procedure are: (1) Formulations of contrast effect, assimilation effect and uncertainty relation between time and space. (2) Potential function defined for phonemic categories. (3) Lattice-like configuration of functional devices. (4) No feed back loop process and no back tracking algorithm. The feasibility of the procedure is verified by applying it to continuous vowels and words. The advantages are discussed from the viewpoints of reliability and flexibility of pattern recognition techniques."
"While gathering acoustic data for the acoustic-phonetic analysis of speech, it is necessary to consider many different sounds in varying phonetic environments to assure that the results are statistically significant. In order to reduce the amount of time required to test hypotheses, a facility has been developed which provides an interactive environment for performing a wide variety of acoustic-phonetic experiments on a large data base of continuous speech. Using this facility, one can formulate an experiment, run it on selected portions (or all) of the data base, and display or tabulate the results in a meaningful way. Another experiment may then be run based on the results. CPU time required to run an experiment on the entire data base is between 5 and 20 seconds, depending on the complexity of the experiment. Due to the ease of interactions, formulating or revising an experiment, running it, and displaying the results normally takes less than 5 minutes. This facility has been used in combination with a data base of 69 hand-labeled sentences to develop algorithms for acoustic-phonetic segmentation and labeling in a speech understanding system. Several examples of its use and the results obtained will be presented."
"This paper describes the acoustic-phonetic analysis of continuous speech in a complete speech understanding system. The system accepts various parameters derived from the digital waveform and short-time spectra, and produces a segment lattice where segments can have overlapping boundaries and the description of segments is a list of labels. Acoustic-Phonetic as well as phonological knowledge of English is employed extensively in labeling the segments. Each label also has associated with it a score, reflecting the confidence in its identity. A description of the acoustic-phonetic analyzer, as well as statistics related to its performance will be presented in detail."
"A real-time speech spectrograph has been developed which is practical for clinical use. It produces and stores a frequency-time-intensity display on a video monitor while the sound is being spoken. The display closely resembles a conventional, broad-band spectrogram in time, frequency and grey scale resolution. Preliminary evaluations have been made to show its usefulness 1. as an aid to the therapist in diagnosis and communication of concepts, and 2. for student drill relatively independent from the therapist. These results suggest that the instrument has considerable potential for training speech production with deaf."
"Various speech signal time characteristics are estimated from voice individuality data transmission standpoint. Speech wave microtime intervals (that is the intervals between the zero-cross and extremal points and the intervals of fundamental tone) are taken as such characteristics from one hand, and macrotime structure of the signal which comprises some prosodic properties of pronunciation from the other hand. Statistical analysis of the above speech signal parameters has shown that the majority of them are closely connected with the individuality of voice. However, these parameters being used for automatic identification of speakers it should be noted that some of them can be controled by speakers and therefore imitated."
"This paper describes two feature selection algorithms applied to different speech segments which are used in an on-line, adaptive speaker verification system. The Information Theoretic approach is used to reduce the redundancies among the features that are originally present in the feature pool. Next, the Between-to-Within variance ratio (BW ratio) feature ordering algorithm is applied for obtaining the optimum combination of interspeaker separability and intraspeaker variability. A preliminary set of experimental results are presented."
"An algorithm to perform realtime recognition of unvoiced fricatives in continuous speech has been developed and tested. The tree-structured algorithm is implemented on a minicomputer, but it can also be economically realized by using simple digital hardware. Zero-crossing and amplitude information from successive 10 msec segments of the speech signal, its derivative and the outputs of two bandpass filters is used to isolate and identify the fricatives. Recognition of /s/, /θ/, /f/ and /\\int/ is better than 95 percent correct with a total decision time of less than 90 msec. The algorithm has been successfully applied in a realtime system to aid the discrimination of unvoiced fricatives by persons with severe high-frequency hearing loss."
 "A new digital filter bank design is proposed for the processing of speech waveforms where spectral pattern matching techniques are applicable. Outputs in decibels from the 30 channels of the filter bank are computed every 12 ms. Care has been taken to select a time window and filter center frequency and bandwidth values that take into account the acoustic characteristics of speech. A distance metric is proposed for comparing a spectral frame with previously derived reference patterns. The metric incorporates procedures for crude speaker/microphone normalization, signal level normalization, background noise normalization, and procedures for emphasizing differences in the region of spectral peaks."
"This paper describes some modifications and extensions to the Bobrow-Fraser Phonological rule testing program (CACM 11, 1968, 766-772), which enable it to expand a dictionary of words read from a file and systematically try all possible combinations of optional rules, compute a running \"probability\" of a pronunciation as a function of probabilities of application and non-application of individual optional rules, associate arbitrary applicability tests with rules, and generate a summary table of which rules applied to each word and which words a given rule applied to. The system uses a notation similar to the classical Chomsky-Halle notation for phonological rules, and has been used to expand a 500-word dictionary for the BBN SPEECHLIS speech understanding system."
"A parallel algorithm is presented which speeds up the operation of arbitrary infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters by an integer factor n. When n is a power of two or highly composite a special numerator factorization significantly reduces the number of multipliers required for large n. The resulting filter can operate at a sampling rate exceeding the inverse of a multiply time. Hence, such filters are not multiplier speed limited. The IIR algorithm is shown to share the desirable property of the FIR algorithm that when resampling is done at the output, part of the filter hardware can be eliminated. The IIR parallel algorithm implements a degenerate filter form. The implications of this on practical filter design are considered and a design example given. It is shown that implementations of these parallel filters can exhibit reduced sensitivity allowing a reduction in the multiplier constant length."
"Presented in this paper is an equivalent network theory for linear shift-invariant discrete-time networks having simple poles. Expressions are given for the network transmittance matrices in terms of a decomposition of the network's rational system function matrix H(z), and a set of arbitrary parameter matrices. Selecting values for the parameter matrices defines a discrete-time network whose system function matrix is H(z). All possible values of these arbitrary matrices define the class of equivalent networks which realize H(z). An important consequence of the theory is that it becomes feasible to synthesize directly the discrete-time structure(s) which are optimum according to a preselected optimization criterion. An example is presented which illustrates the application of the theory in the realization of digital filter structures."
"The optimum design of recursive digital filters in the cascade realization with respect to the output noise is healed here by taking into account the ordering, the pole-zero pairing, and the selection of configurations of the individual sections. In the first part of this paper, the output noise variances are derived for arbitrary realized cascaded configuration employing either the fixed-point or the floating-point arithmetics. The second part presents a simple algorithm to compute the output noise variance without direct evalution of complex integral. An example is presented in which the individual sections are allowed to take on different configurations."
"Directivity effects of large arrays are the result of array geometry and element directivity. Directivity index for a transmitter and array gain for a receiver are the directivity effects included in the sonar performance equations. Using models to predict directivity index and array gain is useful for performance analysis of conceptual arrays as well as existing arrays where measurements cannot be made readily or conveniently. Array gain reduces to directivity index for the case where ambient noise is isotropic. Arrays of directional elements are more difficult to model, except in the case where all elements in array have parallel principal axes whereby pattern multiplication can be applied. An example is presented of a large existing array whose vertical patterns and directivity index are not readily measurable. Directivity effects of this array are predicted using pattern multiplication with models for elements, array, and baffling. Models are validated using measured directivity patterns and directivity index is predicted over a frequency range of two decades to be used for performance analysis of conceptual sonar systems."
 "A comparative performance study of seven pitch detection algorithms was conducted. A speech data base, consisting of eight utterances spoken by 3 males, 3 females, and 1 child was constructed. Telephone, close talking microphone, and wideband recordings were made of each of the utterances. For each of the utterances in the data base a \"standard\" pitch contour was semiautomaticallly measured using a highly sophisticated interactive pitch detection program. The \"standard\" pitch contour was then compared with the pitch contour that was obtained from each of the seven programmed pitch detectors. The algorithms used in this study were (1) a center clipping, infinite-peak clipping, modified autocorrelation method, (2) the cepstral method, (3) the SIFT method, (4) the parallel processing time domain method, (5) the data reduction method, (6) a spectral flattening LPC method, and (7) the AMDF method. A set of measurements was made on the pitch contours to quantify the various types of errors which occur in each of the above methods. Included among the error measurements were the average and standard deviation of the error in pitch period during voiced regions, the number of gross errors in the pitch period, and the number of voiced-unvoiced classification errors. For each of the error measurements, the individual pitch detectors could be rank ordered as a measure of their relative performance as a function of recording condition, and pitch range of the various speakers. Results are presented on rankings based on one category of errors."
"An algorithm for making the voiced/unvoiced decision in speech analysis is presented. Three features (LPC normalized minimum error, ratio of energy content at high to low frequencies, and input RMS) define a three-dimensional space in which the decision making process is viewed as a pattern classification problem. This is formulated as a linear program which runs on a training set to find a hyperplane dividing the V/UV regions if they are separable, or minimizing the distance by which misclassification occurs if they are not. A procedure is given for selecting the features and constructing the training set."
"A computer-oriented voicing decision is described which relies on the correspondence of low frequency energy content and voicing. This voiced /unvoiced decision compares the low frequency energy associated with successive, fixed duration speech intervals. The key to the decision process is the establishment of an adaptive energy reference level which enables the energy-based voicing decision to function independently of changes in overall speech volume. This energy reference level must have sufficient memory to permit inter-word comparisions, but must quickly adapt to rapid volume inflections such as those associated with weak, trailing voiced syllables."
"In this paper, a numerical procedure for solving deconvolution problems is presented. The procedure is based on the Monte-Carlo method which statistically estimates each element in the deconvolved excitation. A discrete Fourier transform technique is used to improve the quality of these estimates for a prescribed amount of computation."
  "Circular convolution of complex number sequences may be implemented over a finite ring using Fourier like transforms. A unified setting is provided wherein these number theoretic transforms may be defined for all odd moduli, thus extending results on this topic."
"A tutorial-review paper on discrete orthogonal transforms and their applications in digital signal and image (both monochrome and color) processing is presented. Various transforms such as discrete Fourier, discrete cosine, Walsh-Hadamard, slant, Haar, discrete linear basis, Hadamard-Haar, rapid, lower triangular, generalized Haar, slant Haar and Karhunen-Loêve are defined and developed. Pertinent properties of these transforms such as power spectra, cyclic and dyadic convolution and correlation are outlined. Efficient algorithms for fast implementation of these transforms based on matrix partitioning or matrix factoring are presented. The application of these transforms in speech and image processing, spectral analysis, digital filtering (linear, nonlinear, optimal and suboptimal), nonlinear systems analysis, spectrography, digital holography, industrial testing, spectrometric imaging, feature selection, and patter recognition is presented. The utility and effectiveness of these transforms are evaluated in terms of some standard performance criteria such as computational complexity, variance distribution, mean-square error, correlated rms error, rate distortion, data compression, classification error, and digital hardware realization."
"It is shown that the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), when used in the conventional manner with the frequency samples located at zero and integer multiples of 1/T, where T is the signal duration, gives an inaccurate representation of the spectrum of certain frequencies that are located near the top and bottom end of the band. It is further shown that this type of error can be eliminated by using the Odd Discrete Fourier Transform (ODFT) in which the frequency samples are located at odd multiples of 1/2T. An application of the ODFT in two dimensional filtering is also discussed."
"The Hearsay II speech understanding system under development at Carnegie-Mellon University is a complex, distributed-logic processing system: Processing in the system is affected by independent, data-directed knowledge sources processes which examine and alter values in a global data base representing hypothesized phones, phonemes, syllables, words, and phrases, as well as the hypothetical temporal and logical relationships among them. The question of how to schedule the numerous potential activities of the knowledge sources so as to understand the utterance in minimal time is called the \"focus of attention problem\". Near optimal focusing is especially important in a speech understanding system because of the very large solution space that potentially needs to be searched. Using the concepts of stimulus and response frames of scheduled knowledge source instantiations, competition among alternative responses, goals, and the desirability of a knowledge source instantiation, a general attentional control mechanism is developed. This general focusing mechanism facilitates the experimental evaluation of a variety of specific attentional control policies (such as best-first, bottom-up, and top-down search heuristics) and allows the modular addition of specialized heuristics for the speech understanding task."
"The speech recognition system composing a part of the question-answering system operated by conversational speech is described. The recognition system consists of two stages of process : acoustic processing stage and linguistic processing stage. In the acoustic processing stage, input speech is analyzed and transformed into the phoneme sequence which usually contains ambiguities and errors caused in the segmentation and phoneme recognition. In the linguistic processing stage, the phoneme sequence containing ambiguities and errors is converted into the correct word sequence by the use of the linguistic knowledge such as phoneme rewriting rules, lexicon, syntax, semantics and pragmatics. The voice-operated question-answering system for seat reservation is constructed by computer simulation technique and the promising results are obtained."
"A complete solution is given to the problem of finding the number of distinct quadratic residues for a composite modulus. Two specific applications of this result are described. The first one concerns the efficient implementation of chirp filters. It is shown that by an optimum choice of the number of taps, the number of multiplications required to realize a transversal chirp filter can be greatly reduced. Secondly, an algorithm for the computation of DFT, based on chirp filtering, is discussed. It has the potential of being faster than the FFT in certain cases and, in addition, requires less storage for the sine-cosine values."
"The concept of linguistic stress is vital in research in speech perception, speech production and computer speech recognition. The research described here has produced a new and reliable way, using computer analysis, to estimate the linguistic stress levels on individual syllables in complex utterances. An interactive \"Computer Automated Stress Extraction System\" (CASES) was developed to facilitate the research. This system can rapidly compute and display estimated syllable linguistic stress patterns, and all of the usual acoustic parameters from digitized speech. The following results were obtained: a) The computer estimated stress agreed well with perceived data. The stress measure adopted used a combination of five acoustic cues, and this yielded stable estimates of stress magnitudes, in simple utterances, even under variations of syllable locations and with speaker differences. With complex utterances, it was shown that in addition to the acoustic cues, listeners relied on previous linguistic knowledge in the perception of a general stress pattern. b) A new model of stress production was devised which suggested that the stress pattern of an utterance centered around a few special emphasis syllables with the stress pattern on the other syllables determined by anticipatory and recency effects."
"Two methods are described for determining the vocal tract area function from measurements at the lips of the response to an impulsive acoustic pressure wave: - In one case, the impulse response at the lips obtained by deconvolution is used to compute the area function at all points; - Alternatively, the vocal tract is modeled by successive approximation, a search is made for the constrictions by decreasing order of importance rather than sequentially from the lips. Results obtained with both methods are good, the area functions are measured in absolute values rather than in arbitrary units. Advantages, difficulties and limitations of both methods are discussed."
"A progress report is presented on the development of procedures to process laryngeal high speed films to extract the glottal waveform and other glottal parameters. The glottal waveforms derived by this direct method are being used to determine if the pathologic larynx is manifested in its abnormal vibratory pattern. The glottal waveforms measured by sonic-sensing pen tracing, cursor outlining, a photocell technique, and TV camera scanning are presented and compared with the conventional polar planimeter method. To date the TV camera method is the most rapid procedure and can process approximately 400 frames per hour in a semi-automatic mode. This method determines the glottal area, length, and width by a combination of analog/digital circuitry and minicomputer processing."
"In order to test the accuracy of the optimal filter as an area function predictor, the technique is applied to data derived from stepped cylindrical cavities of known dimension. The impulse response of the cavities is measured and an optimal filter is derived from the data. The area function derived from the optimal filter is then compared to the actual cavity area function. In addition, an optimal filter is derived from the theoretically calculated cavity response and the area function derived from this filter is compared to the original cavity area function. Results are presented for several different cavity configurations."
"A transformation is described which converts the vocal tract areas derived from the linear prediction model to vocal tract widths. The transformation is described by the equationw = c(kA)^{p}wherew= vocal tract widthA= vocal tract areac= constantp= power constant andk= absolute areas criterion. Optimum values ofcare given and the best criterion for making the linear prediction areas absolute was that the maximum area is a constant. The transform has been implemented in a real-time articulatory display which gives an overhead of only 14% over simple linear prediction area extraction. The display was found to be capable of showing the position of any vowel. Potential applications include its use as an aid to articulator placement in deaf speech training."
 "The characterization of the influence of lexicon and syntax on the pitch contour in the Italian language is presented. The results of the work will be used in a Speech Understanding System for defining some constraints in the emission of hypotheses and for evaluating the likelihood that a synctatic structure can generate a given pattern of fundamental frequency. The pitch evolution is only determined in voiced tracts; then it is subdivided in a sequence of primitives and translated in symbols. Such strings of symbols are considered as sentences of a set regular languages, whose productions are learned using a stochastic inference procedure. Some results obtained from controlled experiments in which various factors are varied separately are presented."
"The rules for the generation of the pitch contour of a fragment of the Italian language are presented. The generative model, of which the input is a formal description of the sentence and outputs the pitch contour, operates as an automaton. The basic elements for the pitch curve generation are the segments between two accents. Inside these segments the pitch curves is approximated by means of simple primitives. The pitch rules are used to control a digital speech synthesiser."
"When the process of deconvolution or inverse filtering is implemented digitally, a high sampling rate can accentuate the sensitivity to small data errors which besets deconvolution. Conversely, a low sampling rate can cause high analog frequencies to be misrepresented as lower alias frequencies within the digital frequency baseband. This paper considers using alias-free digital signals generated by Poisson transformation to avert the trade-off between these two complications."
"Signal deconvolution is a problem commonly found in digital signal processing. If the recorded data is a nonlinear transformation of the degraded data, then linear techniques for deconvolution are not applicable. Herein we review the nonlinear Bayesian estimate for deconvolution and show that it may be implemented in a sectioned form for processing on-going data streams."

"This paper presents an analysis/synthesis method whereby speech may be transmitted at 600 bps, a data rate which is less than 1 percent of the PCM transmission rate for original speech sounds. This R&D effort was motivated by the pressing need for very-low-data rate (VLDR) voice digitizers to meet some of the current military voice communication requirements. The use of a VLDR voice digitizer makes it possible to transmit speech signals over adverse channels which support data rates of only a few hundred bps, or to transmit speech signals over more favorable channels with redundancies for error protection and other useful applications. The 600 bps synthesized speech loses some of its original speech quality, but the intelligibility is sufficiently high to permit the use of the system in certain specialized military applications. One of the most attractive features of the 600 bps voice digitizer is that it is a simple extension of the 2400 bps linear predictive encoder (LPE) which has been under intensive investigation by various government agencies, including the Navy, and is presently entering advanced development. In essence, the 600 bps voice digitizer is a combination of an LPE and a format vocoder, which is realized by adding a processor to the existing 2400 bps LPE. This add-on processor converts the 2400 bps speech data to 600 bps speech data at the transmitter, and reconverts the data to 2400 bps at the receiver."
"The linear prediction residual has been shown to be an effective technique for isolated word recognition. This paper develops a new spectral interpretation of this method for waveform matching, describes how the accuracy of such a system can be increased by training on multiple repetitions of the reference vocabulary, and how both the reference parameter storage requirements and computation rate can be reduced in half by omitting redundant speech information. Results of experiments vary from a low of 88% when the vocabulary consisted of 25 pairs of rhyming words differing only by the initial consonant sound, to a high of 98.1% when the vocabulary consisted of 107 flight commands having an average of two syllables per word."
"This report describes the development, operation, and performance characteristics of an Advanced Development Model of a Voice Input Code Identifier (VICI). The VICI is an isolated word recognition system capable of recognizing the English digits and four control words, CANCEL, ERASE, VERIFY and TERMINATE independently of speaker for a large population of General American males. A visual feedback system has been incorporated to allow the speaker to verify the correctness of each digit entry and if necessary to correct a faulty entry by the use of the control word, ERASE, and then enter a new digit. A complete code group of four digits can be accepted by the use of the control word VERIFY or rejected by the word CANCEL. The speaker can view on an alphanumeric display each recognized digit within .1 to .2 seconds after it is pronounced in order to verify the correctness of each digit entry. Live tests involving a total of 30 speakers showed that a four digit group could be entered into the VICI system with verification in as short an interval as 2.8 seconds. Four to seven seconds were typically required for most speakers for a digit group if no errors were made either by the speaker or the system. Ten to 12 seconds were required by most speakers to detect and correct an error and complete the entry of a proper code. It was necessary to employ correction for an average of 7.5% of the 75 digit groups spoken by the 29 participants in the live tests. In every case the errors were correctable and every code was entered properly."
"The adaptive pattern recognition theory has been programmed on the IBM 1130 computer and applied for the recognition of speech patterns initially in the form of sonograms of CVC Hindi syllables spoken in isolation. A set of thirty six Hindi syllables spoken by three male speakers was used in the learning and recognition phases of the system. Two experiments were performed. In the first, the computer was trained by using the syllables spoken by a single speaker only; in the second, training was based on syllables spoken by two speakers. In the recognition phases, all the syllables spoken by the speakers of the learning phases were correctly recognized. However, for those speakers whose syllables were not used in the learning phase, the percentage of correct recognition was 19.4% and 61.1% for the first and second experiment, respectively."
"Advanced development of the Word Recognition System (WRS) will result in a system that provides direct, two-way verbal communication between front-line personnel and the Army Tactical Data Systems (ARTADS) using discrete word recognition, speaker identification and verification, and voice response techniques. The minicomputer based WRS will achieve fully automated real-time prompting, message translation, and synthesized-speech response over three communication nets simultaneously for any 3 of 64 users with a recognition vocabulary of approximately 250 words. Speech recognition/ synthesis technology is combined with a complex syntactical handler and operating system to achieve these objectives in the field environment."
"A hierarchially organized computing recognition system is described. The primary dynamlc spectrogram is obtained by means of 23 1/3 - octave filters. The algorithms of the lowest recognising levels deal with finding out the phonetic features in the spectrogram. At the highest recognizing levels the nonunanimous string of phoneme codes is converted by the lexical algorithm into the sequence of words of the restricted vocabulary. The grammatical and semantical algorithms select those of them which are in accordance with the rules of the phrase construction. 150 Russian words pronounced isolatedly and in simple phrases have been recognized by the computing system with 90% effectiveness."
  "Linear prediction filters have recently been employed to obtain power spectral estimates which exhibit excellent resolution properties, particularly for the case of narrow band spectra. In this paper, we discuss an extension of linear prediction spectral analysis in which both previous and future values of the data sequence are used to estimate the sample of interest. Theoretical performance measures for this class of estimators are developed and used for comparison with linear prediction methods. It is shown that he new estimators, termed linear estimation filters, provide lower mean-square-error estimates in some problems of interest than can be achieved using linear prediction filters. The resulting power spectral estimates, however, are in general poorer than those provided by linear prediction . The conclusion drawn is that he mean-square-error criterion may not be the appropriate performance measure for this class of spectral estimator sand that additional criteria, such as aspectral flatness measure, should be investigated."
 "Some methodologles based on fuzzy set theory are proposed for emitting and verifying lexical hypotheses in a Speech Understanding System. Context-independent and context-dependent features are extracted from spectrogram patterns with a procedure that establishes a correspondence relation between a speech segment and its linguistic interpretation. The syllabic hypotheses are used for emitting lexical hypotheses by an algorithm that compensates for partial corruption of the syllabic information exploiting the lexical redundancy."
"This paper will present research results and discussions about two very different types of prosthetic devices for the blind. Both devices, speech compressors and hearing aids, have applicability for much broader populations than simply the blind, but both assume greater importance when the user is visually impaired. Results of testing blinded veterans' comprehension of pitch corrected speeded speech indicate that this form of \"reading\" has the potential of providing a valuable alternative to Braille, fixed speed talking books, low vision aids, and other techniques when specific types of information are required by the blind individual, Hearing aids, when used by the blind, are forced to convey information about the acoustic environment in addition to simply amplifying speech signals. Various aspects of these additional demands on the instruments are discussed."
"Speech Synthesis by dyads concatenation produces an intelligible speech, but the lack of prosodic features like rythm and intonation gives the speech an unnatural and unpleasant sound. Having regard to the short-dated applied objectives, It's proving necessary to find a simple set of intonation patterns without taking the complexity of syntactic sentence structuration and the many derived rules into account. Intrinsic characteristics of each dyad are stored and a very simplified grammar is used to surimpose them automatically a pitch pattern, function of the following parameters: Type of sentences, End of each kind of syntagms, words boundaries, and words position inside a sentence."
"This paper presents a new approach to automatic segmentation and feature normalization of connected speech based on area functions. Algorithms for segmenting speech sounds into vowel-like and nonvowellike segments, and then for identifying vowels and detecting nasal segments, turbulence noise segments, etc. are described, together with an algorithm for feature normalization. Fairly reasonable results were obtained with seven sentences spoken by two male speakers and a female speaker."
"A glottal source model generating a volume velocity signal and including the interaction with the vocal cavities is discussed. The model is loaded by an equivalent circuit for the driving point impedance of the vocal tract. This circuit is controlled dynamically by the first two formant frequencies. The synthesis of this circuit is based on the results we have obtained from a simulation of a lossy vocal tract transmission-line model. A \"coupling index\" is defined as a measure of the degree of tract-source interaction which is found to be important for all the first formant range. The effects of this interaction on the shape and spectrum of the volume velocity wave is demonstrated. Among other phenomena observed on human speech, the increase of the first formant amplitude with increasing F0, at a higher rate than that predicted when no interaction is assumed, can be explained by the coupling effects. A simulation on a digital computer of this model was achieved and an analog construction is being investigated and will be used for perception tests."
"A technique is presented for automatically locating and describing the shape of fundamental frequency (F0) patterns throughout a sentence. The function y(t) = atbectis used to model the rise-fall shapes which define F0phrases. The function parameters are derived from a stepwise regression with the F0data, where new values are added to the region of analysis until the variance of the fit gets too large or the next F0point falls outside a prediction interval. The modeling procedure was applied to sentences taken from simulated man-machine interactions; the locations and shapes of the resulting F0phrases were evaluated against phonological phrase structures determined by perceptual experiments. 80% of the phrase boundaries perceived by listeners were located by the F0model. However, 21% of the boundaries found by the F0model were not found perceptually and are classed as False Alarms. In a comparison of perceived phrase types and contour shapes defined by the model, sentence-final phrases marked as complete clause boundaries by listeners were generally found as falling or level patterns, while those sentence-final phrases called incomplete were all found as rising contours by the model."
"This paper reports the results of an investigation of a computable Quality Comparison Measure (called the QCM) for linear predictive systems. The measure described is easily obtained by a synthesis-analysis procedure. It is a weighted combination of differences between the input and output speech parameters for a series of spoken sentences. Results are presented that demonstrate a high correlation between QCM and listener preference scores. The QCM offers an alternative to costly and time consuming formal listening procedures."

"The investigation of infinite electrical networks having no restrictions on their graphs other than countability and connectedness is a recent occurrence. The first rigorous analysis of locally finite purely resistive networks was published in 1971 by Flanders, and the subject has developed apace since then. This article summarizes the current status of the subject and points out some open questions and areas for future research. First of all, various approaches to infinite purely resistive networks are described. They use some ideas from algebntic topology and Hilbert-space theory. These methods no longer work when the network is allowed to have a variety of electrical parameters. Two approaches to the latter situation ate then presented. In one of these, the network is decomposed into an interconnection of a finite number of infinite subnetworks, each of which contains parameters of only one kind. If each subnetwork can be characterized as an operator on Hilbert's coordinate space l2, it is possible under certain circumstances to achieve a solution to the network by extending the customary analyses for finite scalar networks to finite operator networks. The second approach, which is inherently very general and is due to Dolezal, treats an incidence matrix a as an operator on a certain Hilbert space and characterizes the solution of the network by means of the null space of a and its orthogonal complement. All these approaches achieve a unique solution by imposing various conditions in addition to Kirchhoff's node and loop laws. The last part of the paper investigates the whole class of all possible solutions when only Kirchhoff's node and loop laws are imposed."
"During the past five years, multilinear, multipower, and polynomic systems have become a most important area of applications and theoretical development. This paper starts with some typical examples and historical remarks. Using this background, it then proceeds to put the recent literature in perspective and to partially quantify some broad problem categories where intensive work is underway."
"An exposition of the concepts and of the results in feedback system stability is given. Both the input/output approach and the Lyapunov approach are considered, and it is shown how these may be viewed and unified in the context of dissipative systems."
"An overview of recent results on basic causality structure properties, additive canonical decompositions, and the connections between these decompositions and other systems theorelic properties is given. Particular attention is devoted to the implications of causality properties in the solution of basic problems in feedback system analysis and optimal control."
"This paper surveys the distributed system parameter identification problem and concludes that it can be treated as a series of largely independent subproblems, each of which must be considered in any attempt to treat the problem in applications. An approach is discussed which treats in a unified manner all the inherent subproblems. An annotated bibliography of the literature in the field analyzes the contributions of the various authors to each step in the solution of problems of parameter identification in distributed systems. The applications of existing techniques are discussed, and the paper closes with conclusions and recommendations for future work in the field."
"Nonlinear systems which are governed by a finite number of ordinary differential equations with controls present constitute a large and important class models for practical purposes. In the last few years, there has been considerable progress in our understanding of this class of models. This is an expository paper devoted to surveying and explaining some of the main results currently available. Background material on manifold theory is included in order to make the paper more nearly self-contained."
"Linear passive time-variable networks are investigated primarily through the use of distributional kernels as applied to the scattering matrix treated in the time domain. Necessary and sufficient conditions for passivity are obtained, and the scattering matrix is shown to be a measure satisfying an energy form constraint. Lossless constraints pertinent to synthesis are developed while networks consisting of a finite number of circuit elements are considered in some detail. Examples illustrating interesting behavior are presented."
"The maximum power transfer problem is discussed for the case of a pure resistive termination. New bounds on the available power are given."
"The problem of factoring a positive Hermitian operator into the product of a causal operator and its adjoint is reviewed. Three classes of factorization are studied, miniphase factorization, regular factorization, and special factorzation. The former always exists, and a complete representation thereof is obtained in terms of the properties of reproducing kernel spaces. The regular factorization does not exist, in general, and its existence theroy is shown to be equivalent to the unitary equivalence problem of classical operator theory. Finally, an existence and uniqueness theorem for special factors is formulated in terms of certain Cauchy integrals and is shown to be closely related to Wiener-Hopf theory."
"A great deal of what systems engineers do is rooted firmly in the concepts of modern algebra. Despite this fact, however, systems manipulations have often been carried out with little or no awareness of their basic algebraic nature. However, recent years have witnessed a growing cognizance of the intrinsic presence of algebra in systems theory, and this recognition has led not just to further understanding of problems already solved but to unforeseen solutions of problems unsolved by the older, less formal methods. This paper is intended to introduce the art of recognizing the sorts of issues which may be clarified and resolved through the application of modern algebra. Among the topics discussed are modules, quotients, and tensors, together with illustrative applications."
"A Gaussian stochastic process (yt) with known covariance kernel is given: we investigate the generation of (yt) by means of Markovian schemes of the type dxt= F(t)xtdt + dwtyt= H(t)xt. Such a generation of (yt) as the \"output of a linear dynamical system driven by white noise\" is possible under certain finiteness conditions. In fact, this was shown by Kalman in 1965. We emphasize the probabilistic aspects and obtain an intrinsic characterization of the state of the process as the state of an externally described stochastic I/O map. Realizations of (yt) can be constructed with respect to any increasing family of ω-fields; in particular, when the family of ω-fields is induced by the process itself, the driving white noise reduces to the innovation process of (yt). The corresponding realization has been referred to as the \"innovation representation\" of (yt)."
"A synthesis procedure for systems with a nonlinear time-varying constrained part (plant) with uncertain parameters, subjected to a finite set of deterministic command and disturbance inputs I = {iα} is presented. The design must guarantee that in response to iα, the system output cα∈ Sα, despite the plant uncertainty, where Sαis a prescribed set of acceptable responses, for that α value. The basic design philosophy is to convert the uncertain nonlinear plant set into an \"equivalent\" uncertain-linear time-invariant plant set. A synthesis procedure exists for the latter problem. Schauder's fixed-point theorem is used to prove that the resulting design satisfies the nonlinear problem. The final design emerges, in general, with linear and nonlinear time-varying compensation networks. Two design examples are included."
"The Riccati equation plays as important a role in scattering theory as it does in linear least squares estimation theory. However, in the scattering literature, a somewhat different framework of treating the Riccati equation has been developed. This framework is shown to be appropriate for estimation problems and makes possible simple derivations of known results as well as leading to several new results. Examples include the derivation of backward equations to solve forward Riccati equations, an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the Riccati equation, the derivation of backward Markovian representations of stochastic processes, and new derivations and new insights into the Chandrasekhar and related Levinson and Cholesky equations."
"We consider the stability of the feedback interconnection of possibly unstable n-input n-output subsystems whose interconnection is described by e1= u1- y2, e2= u2+ y1and yi= Gi(ei), i = 1,2. We give three theorems which simplify the stability tests. Theorem 1 deals with nonlinear time-varying subsystems. It gives conditions on G2so that the stability of u1↦ y1guarantees that of the feedback system. The other two theorems consider continuous-time linear time-invariant subsystems. It is noted that in the multivariable case, the stablity of ui↦ yi, i = 1,2 is not sufficient to guarantee the stability of the feedback system, and Theorem 2 specifies some additional requited conditions. Theorem 3 shows that if G^2and G^1(I + G^2G^1)-1are in some special stable classes, so is the transfer function of the feedback system. In both theorems, corollaries specialize the results to lumped and single-input single-output cases. The paper ends by showing how these results can be translated for the discrete-time case."
"The control of infinite-dimensional systems has received much attention from engineers and even mathematicians. Realizability although first considered in [4] has been ignored until recently. Ironically enough while state-space systems theory was developing in the early 1960's a mathematical study of scattering and of non-self-adjoint operators produced a parallel theory which was infinite dimensional from the beginning. When the close relationship between the two subjects became known time invariant infinite-dimensional systems theory advanced quickly and at a general level it now seems reasonably complete. This paper describes the connection between mathematical scattering and systems. It then gives a thorough treatment of infinite-dimensional time invariant continuous time systems. The last section lists recent scattering results which might be of engineering interest."
"Linear multivariable-distributed systems and synthesis problems for lumped-distributed networks are analyzed. The methods used center around the invariant subspace theory of Helson-Lax and the theory of vectorial Hardy functions. State-space and transfer function models are studied and their relations analyzed. We single out a class of systems and networks with nonrational transfer functions (scattering matrices), for which several of the well-known results for lumped systems and networks are generalized. In particular we develop the relations between singularities of transfer functions and \"natural modes\" of the systems, a degree theory for infinite-dimensional finear systems and a synthesis via lossless embedding of the scattering matrix. Finally coprime factorizations for this class of systems are developed. These factorizations play an essential role in the development and show that properties of Hardy functions are of fundamental importance for this class of distributed systems as properties of rational functions are for lumped systems."
"The resistance value of two electrodes attached to two-dimensional regions with rotational antisymmetry is obtained using the rule when equipotentials and lines of flow are interchanged. This is an extension of a previous work [1] in which mirror antisymmetrical regions were treated."

Nontrivial examples are used to illustrate the procedure, which has potential applications in several system theory problems."

"Most of the technologically important aspects of magnetic recording are reviewed in a nonmathematical manner. After a discussion of recording media and heads, the fundamentals of the media magnetization and writing processes are considered. The factors limiting the bandwidth, distortion, and signal-to-noise ratio of audio, instrumentation, video, and digital recording machines are analyzed. The paper concludes with some predictions on the future of magnetic recording."
"A broad generalization of memristors--a recently postulated circuit element--to an interesting class of nonlinear dynamical systems called memristive systems is introduced. These systems are unconventional in the sense that while they behave like resistive devices, they can be endowed with a rather exotic variety of dynamic characteristics. While possessing memory and exhibiting small-signal inductive or capacitive effects, they are incapable of energy discharge and they introduce no phase shift between the input and output waveforms. This zero-crossing property gives rise to a Lissajous figure which always passes through the origin. Memristive systems are hysteretic in the sense that their Lissajous figures vary with the excitation frequency. At very low frequencies, memristive systems are indistinguishable from nonlinear resistors while at extremely high frequencies, they reduce to linear resistors. These anomalous properties have misled and prevented the identification of many memristive devices and systems-including the thermistor, the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane circuit model, and the discharge tubes. Generic properties of memristive systems are derived and a canonic dynamical system model is presented along with an explicit algorithm for identifying the model parameters and functions."
"Extreme distortion and time-dependent Faraday rotation occur for propagation of short electromagnetic pulses in magneto-plasma, for some ranges of plasma parameters. In order to relate pulse and monochromatic waves for propagation-path diagnostic purposes, we introduce a new parameter for the transmitted pulse train which has properties that correspond very accurately to results that would be expected for Faraday rotation of a continuous wave having the central frequency of the incident pulse spectrum. Results for 5-ns pulses (10 GHz) are presented for varying propagating length, static magnetic field, electron density, and collisional absorption."
"The development of the insulated antenna is outlined from its beginnings as an ocean cable. The generalization of the theory from that applicable only to coaxial lines with an outer conductor of infinite extent to an insulated antenna embedded in a relatively dense medium that may be a dielectric or a conductor is described. The properties of the eccentrically insulated antenna and their usefulness in traveling-wave directional arrays for lateral-wave transmisson are reviewed. The diagnostic applications of the insulated antenna are considered with special reference to the measurement of the electric field in an ambient medium independent of its permittivity and to a study of the properties of a plasma-filled tube."
"Adaptive array antenna systems are currently the subject of intense interest and investigation/development for radar and communications applications. The principal reason for the interest is their ability to automatically steer nulls onto undesired sources of interference, thereby reducing output noise and enhancing the detection of desired signals. These systems usually consist of an array of antenna elements and a real-time adaptive receiver-processor which has feedback control over the element weights. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to adaptive arrays from the viewpoint of antenna beam-forming and null steering. The particular vehicle chosen for discussion is the Howells-Applebaum analog servo-control-loop processor. This processor derives feedback control error signals from the correlations between element signals, i.e., on the basis of the covariance matrix of the set of system inputs. A simple two-element array with a single adaptive control loop is addressed first, in order to set the stage for analysis of a basic K-element linear array with K adaptive control loops. The set of linear differential equations associated with the controlloop network can be solved by a Q-matrix transformation into orthonormal eigenvector space. The purely mathematical Q-matrix is interpreted in terms of orthogonal beam-forming networks, similar in principle to a Butler matrix beam-forming network. The Q-matrix network produces a set of K orthogonal normalized eigenvector beams whose output powers are proportional to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. These beams are utilized in a convenient expression for calculating the time-dependent output pattern function for the array. Performance characteristics have been calculated for different distributions of interference sources to demonstrate the effects of power level, source location with respect to the quiescent beam pattern, source spacing in terms of array resolution, source bandwidth, continuous source distributions, and the array \"degrees of freedom\" captured. Two modifications of the basic system are also included: the addition of a hard-limiter in the control loops, and a change in the antenna aperture element arrangement to a circular array with an omni \"mainbeam.\""
"Mott et al. have attempted to provide an explanation of the unacceptably fast charge relaxation in good conductors that is predicted by the conventional analysis. It is shown here that their explanation is unsatisfactory. However, certain smaller but interesting features do emerge from a solution of the modified formulation."
"The commonly used two-term relaxation equation can lead to inconsistencies, which researchers have sought to resolve by introducing diffusion and scattering-time effects. It is shown here that the complete equation ∂n~/∂t + σ/ε n~+ E→ċ grad→(nµ) = 0 is sufficient to account for charge flow, propagation effects and surface-charge induction, as well as instabilities in negative-differential-conductivity materials."

The resulting equations confirm that there should be no Doppler shift for light reflected from a transversely moving mirror. This result disproves several previous theoretical predictions."
"The classical and relativistic Doppler shifts are compared for light incident at any angle upon a perfectly reflecting mirror moving in any arbitrary direction. It is shown that experiments designed to test the theory of special relativity in reflecting systems must be accurate up to third order in v/c."

"It is easy to argue that real signals must be bandlimited. It is also easy to argue that they cannot be so. This paper presents one possible resolution of this seeming paradox. A philosophical discussion of the role of mathematical models in the exact sciences is given and a new formulation of the 2 WT theorem is presented. The paper is a written version of the second Shannon Lecture given at the 1974 International Symposium on Information Theory. An appendix giving proof of the 2 WT theorem has been added."
"Field calculations in the presence of rotating bodies with symmetry of revolution can be performed in the (inertial) laboratory frame of reference. Specific results are presented for a rotating circular cylinder immersed in a plane wave of the E or H type. Particular emphasis is put on the low-frequency limit, but some numerical data are also given for a typical frequency in the \"resonance\" region. The analysis becomes more complicated in the absence of symmetry of revolution. It is then necessary to solve the problem in a rotating system of coordinates. Maxwell's equations are written in these coordinates, together with the relevant constitutive equations and boundary conditions. The general formalism is applied to a typical two-dimensional configuration, viz., a cylinder immersed in an incident E wave. Considerable simplification obtains if all material velocities are negligible with respect to c, a condition which is always met in practice. Even simpler results are obtained if the cross-sectional dimensions of the cylinder are small with respect to λ. Some numerical results are presented, at low frequencies, for a dielectric cylinder of rectangular cross section."
"Guided-wave acoustooptic Bragg diffraction from a single surface acoustic wave (SAW) and from two tilted SAW's has been analyzed to establish the design parameters of the related devices. Design and performance figures of the devices involving three and four tilted SAW's in single-mode Y-cut LiNbO3out-diffused waveguides are described in detail. Device bandwidth of up to 358 MHz, an optical throughput coupling efficiency of up to 25 percent, and very good optical beam quality have been realized. A bandwidth of 358 MHz enables the device to deflect a light beam of 1-cm aperture into 1000 resolvable spot diameters with a random-access switching time of 2.8 µs. A total electric drive power of 220 mW was required to diffract 50 percent of the incident light power for the unit with 245-MHz bandwidth. The development of this wide-band technique has paved the way for using such guided-wave acoustooptic devices in a number of applications in addition to those common to bulk-type acoustooptic devices."
"For more than 100 years, scientists have attempted to determine the truth or falsity of claims for the existence of a perceptual channel whereby certain individuals are able to perceive and describe remote data not presented to any known sense. This paper presents an outline of the history of scientific inquiry into such so-called paranormal perception and surveys the current state of the art in parapsychological research in the United States and abroad. The nature of this perceptual channel is examined in a series of experiments carried out in the Electronics and Bioengineering Laboratory of Stanford Research Institute. The perceptual modality most extensively investigated is the ability of both experienced subjects and inexperienced volunteers to view, by innate mental processes, remote geographical or technical targets including buildings, roads, and laboratory apparatus. The accumulated data indicate that the phenomenon is not a sensitive function of distance, and Faraday cage shielding does not in any apparent way degrade the quality and accuracy of perception. On the basis of this research, some areas of physics are suggested from which a description or explanation of the phenomenon could be forthcoming."
"It was found experimentally that six compounds of the homologous cholates and their acids exhibit a new kind of superconductivity not hitherto seen in the superconducting metals or alloys. This superconductivity is manifested in a two-phase state, with the superconducting state occurring in small randomly dispersed domains side by side with the bulk insulating state in which the superconducting domains are sparsely dispersed. The transition temperature of these compounds ranged from 7.5 K for the sodium dioxycholate to 277 K for the sodium cholanate."

Germanium was used as the p-type dopant to eliminate impurity diffusion and to maximize minority carrier diffusion lengths. These procedures provide precise control of the thickness and carrier concentration of each individual layer."
"This letter discusses the effects of surface charges and the cathode doping notch on the high-field domain propagation in an X-band cylindrical Gunn-effect device. The charges considered are the direct result of Maxwell's boundary conditions imposed at the device surface. The letter also demonstrates that, for Gunn oscillations to prevail, a 3-dimensional model requires a larger doping fluctuation than a 1-dimensional model."
"Detailed vibrational displacement distributions of the thickness-shear modes of a plano-convex AT-cut quartz plate have been measured for the first time utilizing a laser interferometric technique. The technique is unique in that simple introduction of a low-frequency phase modulation into one of the laser beams makes measurements essentially free from the environmental mechanical disturbances, and hence relatively simple optical setups may be used for measuring in-plane vibration displacements down to the order of several angstroms."
"Optical heterodyne detection at room temperature in a silicon p-i-n diode for the 7-13-GHz range is reported here.

"Computer techniques now emerging in the laboratory promise new capabilities for voice communication between man and machine. Three modes of interaction are of special interest: computer voice readout of stored information, automatic verification of a caller's identity by means of his voice signal, and automatic recognition of spoken commands. Applications extend to: voice-directed installation of telephone equipment, authentication by voice of a credit customer or of an individual requesting readout of privileged information, and voice-controlled services such as repertory dialing or automatic booking of travel reservations."
"Digital techniques for implementing voice response systems are discussed. In particular, attention is focused on practical methods for computer voice response that are likely to be important in the near future. The general method of concatenating isolated words and phrases to form a message is discussed, along with the various possibilities for digital representations of speech signals. The techniques used to implement an all-digital voice response system with multiline capability are presented. A wide variety of experimental applications of this particular system are also included."
"For many applications, it is desirable to be able to convert arbitrary English text to natural and intelligible sounding speech. This transformation between two surface forms is facilitated by first obtaining the common underlying abstract linguistic representation which relates to both text and speech surface representations. Calculation of these abstract bases then permits proper selection of phonetic segments, lexical stress, juncture, and sentence-level stress and intonation. The resulting system serves as a model for the cognitive process of reading aloud, and also as a stable practical means for providing speech output in a broad class of computer-based systems."
"Prosody plays the role in speech ot producing a spoken message meaningful to a particular circumstance, from otherwise unweighted abstract units called phonemes. In the process of message formation, phonemes are given proper acoustic characterization according to the syntactic and semantic structure of the message, the location of stress and boundaries, and surrounding phonemes. Since this process occurs at a subconscious level, it has not received attention from researchers in the language related fields until recently. The recent progress in speech-synthesis techniques has made us aware of the importance of prosody in speech communication, and has encouraged the rule formation for this process. This paper concerns work at Bell Laboratories in the area of purely automatic (i.e., nonhuman) text synthesis. It summarizes the development of related prosody rules from natural speech data."
"A model of human articulation is described whose spatial and dynamic characteristics closely match those of natural speech. The model includes a controller that embodies enough articulatory \"motor skill\" to produce, from discrete phonetic strings, properly timed sequences of articulatory movements. Together with programs for dictionary searching and rules for duration and other phonetic variables, the model can produce reasonably acceptable synthetic speech from ordinary English text."
"This paper presents a survey of automatic speaker recognition techniques. The paper indudes a discussion of the speaker-dependent properties of the speech signal, methods for selecting an efficient set of speech measurements, results of experimental studies illustrating the performance of various methods of speaker recognition, and a comparision of the performance of automatic methods with that of human listeners. Both text-dependent as well as text-independent speaker-recognition techniques are discussed."
"The relation of speaker verification to other pattern-recognition problems in speech is discussed, especially the distinction between speaker verification and speaker identification. The prospects for automatic speaker verification, its settings and applications are outlined. The techniques, evaluations, and implementations of various proposed speaker recognition systems are reviewed with special emphasis on issues peculiar to speaker verification. Two large-scale operating systems using different analysis techniques and applied to different settings are described."
"Voice input to machine is the most natural form of man-machine communications. In this type of system the machine responds to the mode of communications preferred by the user, rather than vice versa. Many practical applications exist today for limited capability voice input systems. The first operational voice input systems have taken place with limited vocabulary, isolated word voice input systems. Most of these initial systems were for industrial applications in which the users' hands or eyes were already busy with their normal work requirements. Future developments in both new applications and increased capability voice input systems can be expected to considerably expand the usage of this form of man-machine communications."

The variation of the SAW velocity, an estimate of the electromagnetic to acoustic coupiing (Δv/v), the temperature coefficient of delay (TCD), and the power flow angle have been theoretically predicted for the standard crystallographic cuts. This material is shown to have more than 1.5 times the coupling of LiNbO3, SAW velocities only slightly higher than Bi12GeO20, low temperature coefficients of delay, and low power flow angles."

The plate is a 127.86° rotated Y-cut X-propagating plate and has a large electromechanical coupling coefficient."
"Recent results obtained with helical surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) delay lines of large time delay and bandwidth are described. Both unguided and guided propagation are involved, with time delays up to one millisecond and bandwidths up to 65 MHz being observed. Fiber delay lines of both capillary and cladded types are also discussed. The potential for future application of SAW delay lines of large time-bandwidth product to high-speed signal-and data-processing systems is considered."
"Information can be stored serially in an acoustic beam wrapping about the closed surface of a circular thin disk. Beamguiding may be secured by exploiting a natural interaction between edge curvature and crystal anisotropy. Observations at 41 MHz, on Y-cut and ST-cut disks, demonstrate the feasibility of building isopaustic low-spurious level (57-dB) long 250-µs) disk delay lines."

Then we report the results we have obtained in the fabrication of: 1) a piezo-MOSFET programmable filter with a bit rate reaching 50 MHz; 2) a Love wave-dispersive delay line with a 240 compression ratio; 3) a fused silica reflective array compressor exhibiting a 30-µs dispersion over a 60-MHz bandwidth around 100 MHz and a 24-dB total insertion loss."
"The piezoelectric film layer transducer represents the most efficient method for generating and detecting surface acoustic waves on nonpiezoelectric substrates. ZnO, which has a strong piezoelectric effect and can readily be sputtered as an oriented crystalline composite on a wide variety of substrates, is a natural choice as the piezoelectric film layer. This paper summarizes a body of knowledge which has been developed on the characteristics of transducer quality ZnO film layers, and focuses attention on those sputtering parameters and microstructural properties which characterize a superior surface-wave transducer film. Requisite sputtering conditions are high substrate temperatures (150-300°C), modest deposition rates (0.5-1.0 µm/h), low background vapor pressures (<5 µm Hg) and an ultraclean vacuum system. Transducer quality surface-wave films are characterized by their optical clarity, high density, smooth surface, small crystallite size, and well-oriented crystallite axes. Such ZnO films will play an important role in future surface acoustic wave device technology."

This ray optical technique differs from the approach employed in recent publications [1], [2], and leads to a better understanding of bulk-wave radiation in SAW devices. PZT ferroceramic materials have been chosen for this study and numerical results are obtained and given."

"Surface-wave components have demonstrated performance capabilities in the VHF/UHF range which are available with no other filtering technique. The major advantages of the filters are their small size, high reliability, low cost, high Q, good reproducibility, temperature stability, wide dynamic range, and linear phase response, as well as special characteristics relevant to specific applications. Surface-acousticwave (SAW) devices are used for bandpass filtering [1], matched filtering for radar pulse compression [2], [3] or spread-spectrum signal processing [4], delay lines [5], and frequency control elements [3], [6]. Within the context of communication systems' applications, this paper reviews the state of the art for SAW components from high-performance fixed-tuned devices to tunable or programmable filters. Major technological advances discussed include unidirectional SAW filters [7] which eliminate bidirectionality loss and simultaneously suppress in-band spurious responses to achieve an insertion loss below 1 dB with a 0.04-dB peak-to-peak ripple. A novel surface-wave sub-system [8] which offers revolutionary signal processing functions through transform processing is also described."
"A surface-wave filter constitutes an attractive alternative for the design of the IF section of a television receiver. The detailed requirements for the TV IF channel are set forth, followed by a comparison of the conventional design with the new design involving a surface-wave filter. The surface-wave filter is introduced by a physical description of the transducer configuration. The procedure for fabricating surface-wave filters is described; it is very similar to that of making integrated circuits. The properties of the surface-wave filter are compared with the requirements in terms familiar to electrical engineers, emphasizing advantages and an occasional disadvantage. In a final section, some areas of possible improvement are indicated, showing that this TV IF filter is an advanced first generation device and that further improvements can be expected."

The distributed reflective arrays are modeled as lossy repetitively mismatched transmission lines with impedance mismatch ε and expressions for the reflection magnitude and phase are given. An experimental technique is described to directly determine both ε and the proper placement of the input/output transducers. Experimental two-port resonator filters have been realized having Q's of 2000-5000, 5-7 dB insertion loss, and ∼35-dB sidelobe suppression. By electrically cascading three resonators, sidelobe suppression of ∼80 dB has been achieved. Resonator structures have been developed in which continuous frequency tuning up to 0.18 percent has been obtained by electronic means."
"It is possible to utilize a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) interdigital transducer (IDT) with a large number of electrodes as a resonator-a SAW resonator. Band-elimination filters and bandpass filters with a narrow bandwidth have been developed employing SAW resonators."
"Two approaches to frequency division multiplexing using SAW devices are described. The first one uses a 9-channel filter array, where the signal combining and splitting is performed using wide-band power splitters. Two of these filter arrays were used in a data link, with data rates up to 7.5 Mbit/s for a total data rate of 67.5 Mbit/s. The second approach uses offset multistrip couplers to channel a wide-band signal into various narrow-band outputs according to frequency. Consequently, this approach exhibits lower insertion loss and is especially suitable for a large number of channels. An 8-channel MSC multiplexer has been constructed with less than 10-dB insertion loss."
"A SAW filterbank (2.5 × 0.9 cm) coupled to a miniature silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) p-i-n diode, multiple-input single-output RF switch array (2.5 × 0.25 cm) forms the basis of a very compact UHF frequency synthesizer. In this paper the operation, design, fabrication, and performance of rapid-switching SAW frequency synthesizers is described. Experimental measurements depicting the spectral purity of the waveforms synthesized by two devices; one fabricated on LiTaO3and the other on AlN-on-sapphire, operating over respective frequency ranges of 520-650 MHz and 970-1210 MHz are provided."
"The performance of a practical compact SAW dispersive filter with a bandwidth in excess of 500 MHz and centered at 1.3 GHz is described. The linear FM chirp filter was fabricated and serially reproduced by electron-beam microfabrication. The effect of an externally implemented weighting function on the time domain performance is discussed. The filter has been found suitable for pulse compression in a high-resolution monopulse radar. Replication of filter sets with identical characteristics is discussed."
"Substantial documentation of the character of spurious responses in SAW devices has shown that they can be completely characterized as families of plate modes when the substrates have parallel top and bottom surfaces. Presented here are theoretical plate mode calculations and the corresponding experimental results for commonly used substrate orientations. It is shown that quantitative terminal response predictions are possible when all the plate modes are included in the analysis. Results for a new substrate cut, 46° (ZYW) LiNbO3, show that it can have lower than -60-dB spurious modes relative to the Rayleigh mode."
"The use of reflective arrays in surface-wave devices has yielded new devices such as resonators in addition to an enlarged parameter range for devices such as radar pulse expanders and compressors. A number of different grating geometries, substrates, and types of reflectors have been employed in resonators, band-pass filters, filter banks, oscillators, and dispersive delay lines. Simple, yet accurate, models have been developed for design and analysis of reflection gratings in these applications. The major application of reflective arrays has been in radar pulse compressors wherein low spurious levels and precise phase and amplitude response have been achieved in devices with time-bandwidth products as large as 104. Other signal-processing applications such as chirp-z transforms can exploit the large time-bandwidth products available in reflective-array devices."
"The surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonator is the surface-wave equivalent of the crystal resonator now used extensively for stable frequency sources and filters. High-Q operation above 30 MHz, ruggedness, and small size characterize these devices. This paper reviews the current status of SAW resonator developments for the benefit of readers with interest or experience in either crystal resonators or SAW devices. Several typical device geometries are illustrated before providing a qualitative description of resonator operation. Some standard terminology and measurement procedures are proposed, based on similarities to crystal resonators but accounting also for some fundamental differences in loss and coupling mechanisms. Certain irreducible losses which limit the achievable Q of the intrinsic cavity are discussed. Applications are summarized with the aid of two filter examples. A variety of fabrication techniques are being used and none have been fully evaluated, especially with respect to reproducibility, tunability, and stability. Advances in theory, applications, and fabrication are occuring at a rapid rate in this exciting new area."
"Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) sampled-data filters can be utilized as serial access READ-ONLY memories to directly implement at carrier frequencies a coherent fast-frequency-hop synthesizer in the VHF and UHF ranges. An example of frequency synthesis using surface acoustic wave discrete chirp filters is shown. A frequency synthesis scheme using a SAW prime-sequence filter is described."
"The principles of a wide range of acoustic-surface-wave devices employing acoustoelectric interactions with semiconductors are described. It is shown that acoustoelectric amplifiers can increase the dynamic range of a delay-line filter. Such devices have been operated on a CW basis and are beginning to become practical. The acoustic convolver and its derivative devices, the optical scanner, the acoustic focusing and imaging devices, and the storage correlator are described. Several of the signal processing applications of the convolver are discussed. Various types of constructional techniques, including the air gap convolver and acoustoelectric amplifier, the strip coupled and external diode convolvers, the use of piezoelectric semiconductors, deposition of a semiconductor on a piezoelectric substrate, and deposition of a piezoelectric material on a semiconducting substrate are discussed."
"An increase of the dynamic range of a surface-wave piezo-electric convolver can be obtained by increasing its bilinear factor. We show that this can be done by reducing the acoustic beamwidth in the interaction region. A lower limit of beamwidth is found through the study of the guided modes in the convolver plate. A 600-BT product device using nonsymmetrical couplers to obtain the beamwidth reduction is described. The main characteristics-bandwidth, dynamic range, spurious signals-are given and we show a linear FM pulse autocorrelation performed in this device."
"Segments of a long biphase coded waveform were correlated in a degenerate acoustic convolver, and the resulting correlation peaks were summed in a SAW recirculation loop. Using a 9 Mchip/s wave-form, 730 µs of waveform was correlated, giving an experimental SNR increase of 40 dB. This system can be used to reduce substantially the acquisition time for synchronization of a direct sequence spread-spectrum communication receiver."
"A sensitive sensor for the measurement of pressure and temperature is created by fabricating a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) delay path on the surface of a thin diaphragm which, in turn, is in contact with the medium to be measured. The SAW delay path and associated electroacoustic transducers are utilized as the feedback circuit in a miniature electronic oscillator. Since the SAW time delay varies almost linearly with diaphragm temperature and pressure induced strain, the oscillator frequency is also a predominantly linear function of pressure and temperature. A frequency output sensor is desirable both for high-measurement resolution and for compatibility with digital data processors. Sensor configurations are discussed which can be optimized for independent measurement of either temperature or pressure."
"Acoustoelectric convolvers for a spread-spectrum communication application age described with a 100-MHz bandwidth. The use of convolvers as programmable matched filters provides the ability to change the coding waveform from bit-to-bit, thus offering improved multipath performance, security against decoding, and protection against repeat jamming. In this paper, we describe design and performance details of a prototype convolver which processes signals of 10-µs duration with a 100-MHz bandwidth. A dynamic range of 50 dB is obtained, and error signals are 30 dB below the output signal with input signal levels of +14 dBm. A test circuit is described which creates typical spread-spectrum signals in which each bit is encoded into 512 chips and data is encoded by inverting the phase of an entire bit at a data rate of 100 kbits/s."
"A new mode of operation for the surface-acoustic-wave convolver has been discovered. The features of this mode are as follows. 1) It is a degenerate mode, but is detected by an interdigital transducer whose periodicity bears no special relationship to the input transducers. 2) It operates only in an interaction region with bi-directional surface wave amplification. 3) It is more efficient than the usual nondegenerate mode which can operate on the same device. 4) It makes possible highly efficient surface wave convolution with significantly lower spurious response than the usual nondegenerate mode. This device consists of a substrate of YZ LiNbO3with a film overlay of CdSe in the interaction region. A dc bias field applied across the electrodes of the output structure provides the bidirectional surface-wave amplification. The device has been used to process PN codes with time-bandwidth products up to 280."
"A novel acoustoelectric device capable of storing large bandwidth analog signals and correlating the stored signal with other signals is described. The device uses charge storage in an array of Schottky diodes on a silicon strip mounted adjacent to a lithium niobate surface-wave delay line. The paper emphasizes experimental results characterizing the device in terms of storage capacity, storage time, linearity, and efficiency. Based on the experimental data, a short discussion is given on anticipated performance limitations."
"The monolithic combination of sputtered zinc oxide on an oxidized silicon substrate has been utilized as an acoustic surface wave nonlinear convolver. It has been found that the mixing efficiency of an area on the device can be weighted either by applied local bias or illumination. It has, furthermore, been found that gate bias or illumination can be used to store weighting information in the form of trapped charge in the zinc oxide. In multiline convolvers one can use the nonlinear relation between the amount of charge trapped and applied writing bias to form matrix addressable memory cell arrays. Also, one can use the sensitivity of the interaction efficiency on applied bias to select a desired output line, and thus, achieve a raster scanning capability without switching any RF."
"Studies of ZnO films which have been performed at Tohoku University are summarized to describe the important role of ZnO films in their application to surface acoustooptic devices on nonpiezoelectric substrates. The ZnO film has been confirmed experimentally as one of the most suitable materials for SAW transducers which can generate surface acoustic waves with power enough to attain the maximum diffraction efficiency in surface acoustooptic devices on nonpiezoelectric substrates in VHF and higher frequencies. It has also been confirmed to be useful as an optical waveguide which is suitable for use as the interaction medium in surface acoustooptic devices."
"Pulsed ionizing radiation was found to degrade for several hundred microseconds the RF output of most of the separated-medium SAW convolvers that were investigated. A model, involving interface traps, is proposed which accounts for most of the observed effects, including those on one of the devices operating in the \"memory\" mode."
"Many thin-film acoustooptic interaction experiments for Bragg modulators and deflectors, for mode converters, and for fast switches have been demonstrated. Due to the high-power density, long interaction length, and controllable dispersion associated with guided-wave structures, thin-film acoustooptic devices have proved to have advantages over their bulk wave counterparts. In this paper, thin-film acoustooptic devices are discussed in terms of 1) the unique features in theoretical calculations which arise from the use of guided-wave structures, 2) the possible device configurations which may improve efficiency and speed, 3) the thin-film material and fabrication problems, 4) the transducer efficiency bandwidth trade-off, and 5) a comparison with bulk acoustooptic devices and thin-film electrooptic devices. Recent experimental results for thin-film acoustooptic modulators and convolvers are included."

Design, evaluation, and pedormance of a number of AO scanning devices using the first two configurations in LiNbO3out-diffused waveguides are presented. A number of potential applications of such wide-band devices are discussed together with some preliminary performance figures."
"Low-loss magnetostatic wave (MSW) propagation in epitaxial yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films allows the development of a technology which is complementary to that of surface acoustic waves (SAW's), but capable of operation in the microwave range from 1 to greater than 12 GHz. Experimental low-loss dispersive and nondispersive tapped delay lines are described. Future developments of MSW's involving signal routing by etched waveguides and periodic resonator structures are discussed, and the properties of MSW's at microwave frequencies are compared with those of SAW's at VHF/UHF."
"CCD's are inherently analog and can be used to implement a number of sampled data filtering functions in the analog domain. The CCD transversal filter is a particularly cost effective building block because of its versatility and simplicity. The limitations and applications of CCD transversal filters are summarized, and their cost advantages relative to digital filters are discussed."
"Glass fibers can be made with attenuation coefficients as low as 0.4 dB/µs for electromagnetic energy in the 1-µm wavelength region. It is shown that this property, together with the potentially very large bandwidths attainable, could provide for delay lines with time-bandwidth products as high as 105. The status and limitations of optical fibers are assessed from the delay line viewpoint, and their application to matched filters indicated."

"The problem of learning the discriminant hyperplanes, given imperfectly supervised training sample sets (which include unreliably labeled samples along the joint boundaries between the sample clusters), represents the topic of this study. The approach is to view the problem as the classical linear inequality problem, but subject to certain additional minimization constraints, and convert it into an equivalent unconstrained linear inequality problem, which is then solved through one of the established procedures in this field."
"An n-input D/A converter fed from an n-bit pseudorandom noise (PN) generator will generate a pseudorandom amplitude noise uniformly distributed and periodic with period N = 2n- 1. By either permuting the D/A inputs or building a longer PN generator, a sequence of length n! (2n- 1) is obtained. The resulting autocorrelations are given."
"A digitally controlled coherent frequency synthesizer is reported which uses two surface acoustic wave chirp filters to generate frequency-hopped waveforms. Attractive features are wide bandwidth and instantaneous switching between frequencies, which are selected by an external word generator. Experimental results show waveforms which hop every 2.5 µs within a 12.5-MHz band. Phase coherence between pulses is demonstrated by correlating the waveform in a surface acoustic wave plate convolver."

"The microprocessor has made it possible for a standard complex function to be employed in a broad range of applications that extends the applicability of large-scale integration (LSI) to many situations that could not support special chip designs. This in turn has freed the technology from previous restrictions to evolve in directions appropriate for microprocessors and associated LSI functions. The result is that many new variations of cirucit design and process technology have arisen that lead toward more dense and higher performance integrated-circuit structures."
"A general overview of the semiconductor technologies available for the manufacture of microprocessor and bit slices is given. Both MOS as well as bipolar processes are covered. Advantages and disadvantages of PMOS, NMOS, CMOS, TTL, ECL, and I2L are discussed. Several of the more special-purpose technologies are briefly mentioned. A comparison is done on the basis of performance, cost, and application, and suggestions are made as to which technology will service best which application. A general prediction is made as to which processes will survive as main stream technologies and what developments can be expected in the near future with respect to improvements. Applications are separated into cost-sensitive low-chip-count areas and high-performance bit-slice-oriented approaches."
"Over the past few years, microprocessor designs have undergone an evolution process shaped largely by improvements in LSI circuit technology and experiences gained from the very large user community. By and large, most microprocessors have internal architectures that are patterned after classical CPU structures. This trend is changing rapidly. High-performance LSI microprocessors are emerging at a slow but steady pace, with architectural features borrowed from larger and more powerful computers. This paper examines aspects of pipelined concurrency and microprogramming as applied to LSI microprocessors, for the purpose of enhancing performance."
"The inherent low cost afforded by MOS/LSI technology has been widely exploited in the functional areas of CPU's, ROM's, and RAM's. Much less attention has been given to I/O and peripheral controller applications. In many microcomputer systems, as in conventional computer systems, the cost of I/O and peripheral control may far overshadow CPU costs. This paper describes an integrated-systems design which makes full use of MOS/LSI capabilities for all commonsystems functions. In this approach, intelligence is distributed throughout the system instead of being concentrated in the CPU. A single-chip floppy-disk controller is described to illustrate the capability of MOS/LSI in peripheral control."
"In this paper, we describe the design, interface, and architectural features of a 12-bit single-chip microprocessor, the IM6100, implemented with a silicon gate complementary MOS (SiG CMOS) process. The features of CMOS circuits for operation in difficult noise, temperature, and power environments are noted. The microprocessor recognizes the instruction set of the PDP-8/E minicomputer. It is also programmed I/O interface compatible with the PDP-8/E. A unique feature of the IM6100 is the provision for a \"transparent\" operator console. An all-CMOS processor system with 256 × 12 RAM, 1K × 12 ROM, and a programmable asynchronous serial interface port can be built with seven LSI devices. The system dissipates 60 mW at 5 V."
"In spite of many shortcomings in regard to performance and hardware/software support, microcomputers have come to enjoy widespread application. Many microcomputer users, however, would still prefer to have minicomputer performance and ease of use coupled with microcomputer cost and size. In this context, the introduction of a minicomputer-compatible microcomputer system is a significant event. Such a system, the DEC LSI-11, is described in this paper from the perspective of both the computer designer and the user. The LSI-11 architecture, organization, and implementation are discussed, together with a survey of special features made possible by the processor's microprogrammed nature. A simple interfacing example is presented, and questions of software support are considered."
"Triple-modular redundancy (TMR) is a classical technique for improving the reliability of digital systems. However, applying TMR to microcomputer systems may not improve overall system reliability because voter circuits may contribute as much to system unreliability as the microprocessors themselves. We examine the issues that affect the effectiveness of TMR for transient recovery and the reliability of semiconductor memory systems. With careful application, TMR can improve the mission time of a small system by a factor of 3 or more."
"Interfacing a peripheral to a microprocessor requires a peripheral interface attached to the processor and a controller within the peripheral, with usually a transmission link in between. Universal and special interface circuits are becoming available for an easy interface with the various microprocessor peripherals. The use of programmable interfaces increases the flexibility of the interface, and standards are necessary for reaching high-volume production. Present standards include serial EIA RS232 and the recent Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus for measuring instruments. Four new standards developed and used at the Mini and Microcomputer Laboratory of Lausanne fill a gap at the following levels: 1) microprocessor data, address, and control bus, 2) parallel data transfer, 3) simple serial data transfer with handshake, and 4) serial bus for data exchange between terminals and processors."
"Current microcomputer software is limited compared to what is available on megacomputers.

The importance of the presence of megasoftware in the development of microsoftware is noted. Programming activity on microcomputer development systems is described. Finally, conjecture is offered concerning future microsoftware capabilities based on the perspective established in the paper."
"The software tools used to develop a microcomputer-based product can have a substantial effect on the development costs, development time cycle, and reliability, of that product. The power and the appropriateness of the commercially available software tools for programming microprocessors vary significantly. Hence, in addition to evaluating the appropriateness of a microprocessor for a particular product, the systems designer must also evaluate the software tools available for that microprocessor. This paper describes the various kinds of software support tools that are commercially available for programming microprocessor. The functions and features of the tool categories of editors, assemblers and compilers, loaders, simulators, and debuggers are discussed. Tradeoffs between cross-computer and resident tools are presented. Finally, an itemized fist of assembler features which support good program design is presented and six commercially available microprocessor assemblers (Fairchild's F8 assembler, Intel's 8080 assembler, Motorola's 6800 assembler, National's IMP-16 assembler, Rockwell's PPS-8 assembler, and Signetics' 2650 assembler) are compared on the extent to which they provide these features."
"ASM/SIMGEN is a software system comprised of a set of independent Fortran program writer modules designed to generate microprocessor assemblers and simulators. It is simple enough to be used by those with limited architecture and programming backgrounds, but flexible and powerful enough to generate efficient well-structured assemblers and simulators for microcomputers with sophisticated architectures and instruction sets. This paper gives a description of the generating system, the generated simulators and the advantages it offers in both engineering and pedagogical applications."
"The microprocessor market is expanding at an amazing rate. The only element of this market more surprising than its rate of growth is its escalating number of new vendors. The time has already arrived when you cannot tell the players without a score card. The score cards in the microprocessor world consist of chip sets, memory, I/O controls, specifications, schematics, support devices, and available software for the various microprocessors. These score cards are the prototyping kits that are so popular today."
"For years, software and hardware development for micro-computer-based products was accomplished by two segregated development efforts. This approach resulted in wasted effort and delays due to inconsistencies between hardware specifications and software implementation at the prototype level. In-circuit emulation, a major breakthrough in microcomputer development systems, has provided the ability to integrate hardware and software development during all phases of the development cycle. The software designer can now work with the prototype hardware as it is being designed by the hardware engineer. In addition, the hardware designer is now able to construct his hardware while working with the actual design software, facilitating debug as hardware development progresses. For the first time, powerful microcomputer development system debug aids can be applied in the user environment."
"This paper defines the microcomputer family in terms of random-access memories (RAM's) and the microprocessor unit (MPU), illustrates test techniques applicable to these devices, and provides information concerning the equipment necessary to perform the task of testing. Several test patterns specifically designed for 4096-bit RAM's (GALTCOL and DIAPAT) are presented. The concept of comparison with a known good device and a new approach called modular sensorialization are illustrated for MPU's. Methods for testing memory and random-logic boards and a summary of commercially available test equipment are also included."
"Microprocessors have become important tools for the electronic designer. Prime motivators for their success have been the advantages they offer in cost reduction and design flexibility.

"Two nonnumeric applications of microprocessors are described. It is shown that commercially available products allow an economical design of a small private automatic branch exchange (PABX). The second application considers a laboratory data aquisition system. Microprocessor characteristics are assessed on the basis of our experience with these applications. In view of some of the shortcomings of current products, some sugsestions are made which would make microprocessors more suitable for the nonnumeric environment. To demonstrate the feasibility of these suggestions, a design of a suitable micro-processor is proposed."
"A high-speed serial matrix printer is used as the framework for presenting an approach to the use of microprocessors in place of complex sequential logic networks. This approach consists of viewing the microprocessor as a logic element that with a program can replace a significant amount of sequential logic circuitry. Instead of translating a logic flow diagram into a circuit schematic, one simply translates the logic flow diagram into the computer program. The resulting product, consisting of fewer packages, is much less expensive and more reliable than its equivalent implemented with random logic. In fact, within the restriction of cost, the design of a printer using random logic with all of the resulting features would not have been attempted. The development was implemented by the use of a generalpropose microprocessor development system."
"Ultrasound is being used in a growing number of clinical settings and offers the potential for supplementing or replacing many X-ray procedures at significantly reduced cost and risk to the patient. Medical applications of ultrasound have been largely qualitative due to an inability to locate the acoustic beam with respect to a coordinate system. A new method for determining the location and orientation of these beams has been developed which incorporates a dedicated micro-processor. The technique involves measuring the transit times of sparkgenerated shock waves. An Intel 8080 processor controls the operation of the system and performs all the computations required to determine the location and orientation of the ultrasound beam with respect to a known coordinate system. Approximately 2800 bytes of read-only memory and 250 bytes of random-access memory are required. System control, the reading of transit times from external counters, and the display of computed results are accomplished with a total of 2 input and 2 output ports. A 32-bit floating-point mathematics program including square root is necessary in order to obtain spatial resolution of ± 0.6 mm within a cubic volume 50cm on a side. The microprocessor performs error checking on the data and will automatically initiate a new measurement sequence should error limits be exceeded."

"This paper describes a microprocessor-controlled \"mini network\" designed for digital-device communication. The network provides a data pipeline which may be switched between any two devices in a many-device system. Data in the pipeline pass through a first-in-first-out buffer memory that my be filled and emptied asynchronously, so that the receiver and sender need not operate at the same data rate. The switching function is performed by a microprocessor in response to device requests for data transfer."
"The introduction of the IBM 5100 portable computer with its high-level APL and Basic languages presents yet another application for the Powerful versatile microprocessor. This paper presents the IBM 5100 from several aspects. The first section is an overview of the computer including a description of the machine's physical attributes, functional capabilities, languages, and features. A detailed description of the characteristics of the 5100's hardware and firmware architecture follows. Later sections discuss the logical and physical attributes of the computer's microprocessor and application areas for the 5100. Finally, a brief projection on the future of microprocessor-based portable computers is presented."
"For some time now, the notion that \"an algorithm is an algorithm\" has been emphasized in digital system design. In approaching such design problems, the question of hardware versus software implementation of the algorithm should be left to the last. In fact, such approaches have not been viable until the advent of the microprocessor, and software design has seemingly gone its own way independently of hardware design. But has it really? It is becoming increasingly clear that structured approaches to the design of digital systems, hardware or software, have evolved in both areas and are virtually identical. It is possible to teach a course on digital system design so that a diverse group can understand and learn from each other's background. It is also possible to have a laboratory wherein realistic projects can be undertaken. In this paper, the digital system design sequence and laboratory facilities at Northwestern University will be discussed. Also, desirable design tools will be postulated."
"Microprocessors and programmable LSI circuits provide increasingly cost-effective alternatives to traditional hardwired electronic or electromechanical circuits and subsystems used in automatic control, data processing, communication, and instrumentation. The design engineer, however, must learn new skills, i.e., digital system architecture and programming, in order to take advantage of this rapidly evolving new technology. This paper describes the experience of developing an effective approach to microcomputer education for both students and practicing engineers at the University of California, Berkeley."

"An efficient and large-tolerant single-mode optical fiber coupler with a tapered structure is fabricated and studied experimentally. The maximum coupling efficiency of 95 percent and the tolerance in the coupling length of 2.5 mm permitting the coupling efficiency of more than 90 percent are obtained experimentally. The approximate analysis based upon a coupled mode equation is developed using a step transition model in order to describe the basic principle of this coupler."

"Traffic signals were first introduced for reasons of safety by providing the right of way to the intersecting traffic in a fixed sequence. It was soon found, however, that a signalized intersection could be used more efficiently by properly timing the traffic light in accordance with the amount of incoming traffic. Further improvement in efficiency was then achieved by coordinating the timing of the traffic signals along a traffic artery. With the advent of computer technology, coordination of signal timing is now extended to cover the two-dimensionally distributed traffic signals in such a way that the timing adaptively follows to the changes of the traffic pattern in the area. Information from a large number of traffic detectors are now automatically collected, processed, and fed to the centrally located wall-map displays as well as to the remote roadside displays to provide the traffic officers and the drivers with such information as congestion, accident, frozen surface, etc. This paper outlines the problems, methods, and principles of the road-traffic control and describes the state of the art with reference to the Tokyo Traffic Control and Surveillance System. Some of the results of floating car surveys, the accident statistics as well as the estimated reduction in exhaust emission and fuel consumption are also presented."
"An attempt is made to survey and assess the nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices including charge-storage devices and FET's with ferroelectric gate insulators. The charge-storage devices are further divided into two groups: 1) charges-trapping devices such as the MNOS and the MAOS, and 2) floating-gate devices such as the FAMOS and the DDC. Approaches for achieving virtual nonvolatility in otherwise volatile semiconductor memories are briefly disscused. Novel structures which provide nonvolatility as well as the theoretical limit of memory array density are also explored."

Research areas requiring Application of short-wavelength lasers also are given."
"In this introductory exposition, the class of noncoherent digital matcted filters (DMF's) which are matched to AM signals is analyzed. Attention is focused on the special case of binary signals and one-bit digitization. Expressions are obtained relating output and input signal-to-noise ratios when the channel interference is additive and a) white Gaussian, b) incoherent and of constant amplitude, and c) coherent and of constant amplitude. These expressions are compared with expressions for the performance of the corresponding noncoherent analog matched filter under the same conditions Improvements in DMF performance obtained by thresold biasing and by dithering are investigated; it is shown that DMF's can be made to outperform analog matched filters by proper use of the former technique. All theoretical results are corroborated by computer simulation."
 "The transient behavior of a transistor with tunnel diode feedback has been studied using the charge-control model for the transistor and empirical power functions for the tunnel diode. Though an accurate nonlinear power function is used for the tunnel diode, the final expressions are obtained in terms of some average time constants associated with the various segments of the tunnel diode characteristic. The theoretical results are found to be in good agreement with experimental observations."

"In this paper, partitioning and the associated generalized partitioned estimation algorithms are shown to constitute a unifying and powerful framework for optimal adaptive estimation in linear as well as nonlinear problems. Using the partitioning framework, the adaptive estimation problem is treated from a global viewpoint that readily yields and unifies seemingly unrelated results and, most importantly, yields fundamentally new families of nonlinear and linear estimation algorithms in a decoupled parallel-realization form. The generalized partitioned estimation algorithms are shown to have several important properties from both a theoretical and a realization or computational standpoint."
"The performance of adaptive state estimators for linear dynamic systems is investigated. The adaptive state estimates are formed under the assumption that the unknown system parameter belongs to a finite set and is thus readily implementable. It is shown that, for the true parameter value in a prescribed region in the parameter space, the corresponding a posteriori probablity (or weighting coefficient in the adaptive estimator) converges exponentially in the vth mean (v > 1) and almost surely to unity. The analysis is based on the asymptotic per sample formula for the Kullback information function, which is derived in this paper. The significance of the analysis for applications is also examined."
"This paper describes the performance characteristics of the LMS adaptive filter, a digital filter composed of a tapped delay line and adjustable weights, whose impulse response is controlled by an adaptive algorithm. For stationary stochastic inputs, the mean-square error, the difference between the filter output and an externally supplied input called the \"desired response,\" is a quadratic function of the weights, a paraboloid with a single fixed minimum point that can be sought by gradient techniques. The gradient estimation process is shown to introduce noise into the weight vector that is proportional to the speed of adaptation and number of weights. The effect of this noise is expressed in terms of a dimensionless quantity \"misadjustment\" that is a measure of the deviation from optimal Wiener performance. Analysis of a simple nonstationary case, in which the minimum point of the error surface is moving according to an assumed first-order Markov process, shows that an additional contribution to misadjustment arises from \"lag\" of the adaptive process in tracking the moving minimum point. This contribution, which is additive, is proportional to the number of weights but inversely proportional to the speed of adaptation. The sum of the misadjustments can be minimized by choosing the speed of adaptation to make equal the two contributions. It is further shown, in Appendix A, that for stationary inputs the LMS adaptive algorithm, based on the method of steepest descent, approaches the theoretical limit of efficiency in terms of misadjustment and speed of adaptation when the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix are equal or close in value. When the eigenvalues are highly disparate (λmax/λmin> 10), an algorithm similar to LMS but based on Newton's method would approach this theoretical limit very closely."
"The equalized-error (\"EE\") training procedure, introduced in this paper, is a new nonparametric training procedure for linear classifiers in a multiple-feautre stochastic environment. This procedure is a form of stochastic approximation that minimizes the sum of the expected normalized first moments of the fasely classified pattern vectors about the decision hyperplane. This sum is the \"EE loss function.\" The minimization is achived by a simply implemented recursive equation. We show that the sequence of decision hyperplanes generated by this recursive equation converges in mean square and with probability one to a hyperplane that minimizes the EE loss function. We provide premiliminary qualitative and quantitative evidence that the EE training procedure converges rapidly and achives low asymptotic error probabilities over a wide range of overlapping pairs of class densities and nonlinearly separable pairs of class densities."
"An adaptive control method can be classified into two categories, actively adaptive or passively adaptive, according to how the available information is being utilized in the on-line calculation of the control. An actively adaptive controller utilizes, in addition to the , available real-time information, the knowledge that future observations will be made, and regulates its adaptation (learning). This is done by anticipating how future estimation will be beneficial to the control objective. On the other hand, a passively adaptive controller, while utilizing the available real-time measurements, does not account for the fact that future observations will be made. Thus any learning in such a case will occur in an accidental manner. This paper summarizes a recent research effort in the development of an actively adaptive control method for nonlinear stochastic systems. A new and simpler set of equations for the original algorithm is given that provides further insight into the concepts of probing and caution in adaptive control. Several examples are chosen to illustrate the actively adaptive control method."
"In this paper, partitioning and the associated partitioned adaptive control algorithms are shown to constitute a unifying framework for adaptive control. Moreover, the partitioned adaptive controls (PAC's) are shown to have several interesting properties as well as a decoupled parallel-processing structure that is computationally attractive. Finally, using the partitioning framework and a related general class of PAC's the adaptive control problem is treated from a global viewpoint that unifies seemingly unrelated previously obtained suboptimal adaptive controls, and, most importantly, yields fundamentally new adaptive control algorithms. These new control algorithms are shown to have several important properties from both a theoretical and a realization or computational standpoint."
"The paper deals two basic problems in systems theory-the identification and control of umknown plants-using a model reference approach. In both cases, methods for determining the adaptive laws for adjusting unknown parameters which result in an asymptotically stable overall system are considered. The first part of the paper deals extensively with the identification problem and presents important developments in this area in recent years; the second part describes briefly some of the questions associated with the control problem which is unresolved at the present time."
"A new solution to adaptive control for a linear time-variant multivariable process with unknown parameters is presented. The proposed method requires knowledge of only input and output data and, consequently, no state estimation is necessary. The control signal is generated by a control block placed in series with the process. The control block behaves as the \"adaptive\" inverse of the process, and has as its input the desired output of the process. The whole control system is asymptotically hyperstable. The control system can solve the main problems encountered in process control: structural differences and parameter variations. In addition, it behaves satisfactorily under the influence of perturbations. The method is extremely simple to implement and quite general in scope. Various examples are included for illustration."
"Dynamic models in which the coefficient processes exhibit sudden changes at random time points can be used to make manifest the influences of subsystem failures or rapid changes in the environment in which a system must operate. Control and regulation of such systems is complicated by the uncertainty which surrounds the effect of future events on system behavior. A satisfactory control policy must quantitatively discount these events of uncertain occurrence to provide good performance for a variety of operating conditions. This paper describes controller synthesis procedures for specific classes of such systems and gives some of the ways in which these controllers differ from those derived under the assumption of perfect knowledge of future plant behavior."
"This bibliography contains the references to the major papers and reports on adaptive systems. The refmences listed are divided into two main sections, one for books and the other for journal, papers, reports, dissertations, patents, and conference papers. In the second section, papers, reports, etc., are indexed into categories e.g., applications, model reference systems, self-oscillating systems, etc."
"A proposal by Muehe and work carried out by Guentzler showing that in new similarity laws for high-density plasmas the discharge currents are scaled by a constant current-tube-radius ratio were directly verified in terms of the electron temperature characteristics including the ionization of metastable atoms."
 "The distribution of the equipment elements of an electrical circuit in groups corresponding to units is reduced to finding a minimum vertex cutset of an undirected graph derived from the circuit."
"A specific third-order result pertaining to Kalman's conjecture is discussed."
"A new procedure for formulating the state equations for RLC circuits without proper trees is presented. This method would force the network to have a proper tree; thus, obviating the necessity of finding the inverse of a general L, C matrix (a matrix which is not diagonal), and saving the memory and time requirements for computer implementation."
"Application of automatic frequency control (AFC) to regulate the spectrum of an injection-driven oscillator is reported. This technique can eliminate noisy asymmetrical multiple sidebands. It is shown that the AFC loop changes the spectrmn to those lines of simple mixing, viz., stable local oscillator, incident signal, and image frequency. The change is reversible, merely by connecting and disconnecting the AFC."
"A new technique is developed for the precise determination of the equivalent circuit parmeters of a quartz crystal resonator: the series resonance frequency, the series resistance, the series inductance, and the capacitance ratio. This technique is unique in that the parameters are determined from the measured data of the crystal admittance by means of computer processing."
"In order to reduce the noise level of the second-harmonictype magnetic modulator, the authors propose a new method of modulation employing pulse-wave excitation at a temperature slightly below the Curie point. It is verified experimentally that the equivalent input noise could be reduced to 0.026 µAT/cm."
"The high-frequency noise properties of a Read diode, whose current multiplication factor in the avalanche zone can be controlled and is finite, has been analyzed. The analysis indicates that the open-circuit noise voltage and the noise figure of the diode are reduced with the lowering of the current multiplication factor. It is also found that the open-circuit noise voltage exhibits a finite peak at the avalanche frequency for finite but large values of M which, however, disappears at lower values of M(≤100)."
"Recursive methods well suited for the numerical computation of the coefficients appearing in the approximation of a probability density function (pdf) with the aid of a known and well behaved reference pdf and its successive derivatives are presented in this letter. The use of the normal law as a reference law is examined."
"In a recent paper [1], a certain two-dimensional recursive estimation procedure was claimed to be optimal. Here, we show that it is not and point out a mistake in the proof given."
 "Networks of neuron-like elements with random thresholds and interconnection weights and absolute refractory periods are studied mathematically to determine their equilibrium levels and stability, and to note different types of behavior. A future aim is to build computing machines based on concepts quite different than today's."
 "A new receive-array adaptive beamformer configuration is presented. The array output signal consists of the difference between a conventionally weighted beam and an adaptive beam that is constrained to have a spatial null in the direction of interest. Adaptation then provides minimum total array output power."

"Benjamin Franklin's electrical work is reviewed, much of it through his own words. Emphasis is placed on the important role new instrumentation-the improved electrostatic machine and the Leyden jar-played in the development of his theoretical views."
"Joseph Henry (1797-1878), America's foremost electrical physicist of the early nineteenth century, stood at the center of the developing science and technology of the newly discovered electric current. The electromagnetic telegraph and the battery-powered motor were two leading technological efforts of the period. Although Henry chose not to engage in the actual inventive process, he closely followed the development of both devices. While he fully supported the work on the telegraph, especially S.F.B. Morse's experiments, he stood opposed to the battery-powered motor on the grounds of impracticality. He stated these views forcefully to the numorous inventors who sought his expert advice on electricity. This paper explores the reasons for Henry's contrasting opinions of the telegraph and the motor. Underlying these opinions was a set of assumptions about the progress of technology and its proper relations to scientific knowledge and the current needs of society."
"In 1864, following the recommendation of a committee of eminent French scientists, Emperor Napoleon III awarded \"Le Prix Volta,\" 50 000 francs, to a Paris instrument maker, Heimich D. Ruhmkorff, for \"l'invention de la bobine d'induction.\" When news of this reached Washington, Charles G. Page, a patent examiner, claimed to have anticipated Ruhmkorff's first coils by 13 years. Page was subsequently able to secure a special Act of Congress authorizing an extraordinary patent for the coil. While this patent was ostensibly designed simply as a formal tribute and to \"vindicate our own nationality in the paths of science,\" Page's attorney, in league with the Western Union Company, began to press charges of infringement. Even though there is no evidence that Page conspired to exploit his \"honorific\" patent-indeed, he died shortly after it issued-many of his one-time partisans denounced it as \"an outrage on the public.\" Controversy eventually subsided, and most authorities conceded that Page's priority claim was valid. Nevertheless, Page was virtually forgotten, while historians of science have continued to treat Ruhmkorff as a noteworthy figure on the basis of the recognition accorded him for his work on the coil. Yet, by standard criteria such as publication Ruhmkorff was not a scientist at all, whereas Page was a bona fide experimental physicist, a worthy peer of Joseph Henry. The story of the Volta Prize and the Page Patent, then, reveals something about scientific chauvinism, and about the capricious basis of scientific repute."
"Soon after the first Atlantic cable was laid in 1866, social and technical adjustments were made at the terminal stations which were essential to its successful operation. This critical period of change extended through the 1870's. Activity at Heart's Content is examined through reference to the original logs and letter books."
"Telecommunications is unique among technologies in its minimum demands upon the material and energy resources of nature. Throughout its history-particularly in the past century-it has found ways to increase its message handling capacity and reduce the unit costs by engineering developments, particularly by improved coding procedures. These coding procedures exploit both the single worldwide common medium of the radio spectrum and the multiple use of physical conductors employing cables and tubes and, more recently, by optical transmission to carry many messages simultaneously through common media. The cost of individual messages has continually decreased and the available media would be wasted rather than consumed if not used. Telecommunications may be substituted for many technologies such as physical transportation, which would consume scarce supplies of energy and materials. The paper is a historical outline of how the technology of telecommunications has expanded in the past century based on concepts as old as man's discovery of speech, smoke signals, picture writing, and the alphabet."
"The rise of a \"science-intensive\" industry, electronics, illustrates the transition of the United States from a scientifically underdeveloped nation to a world leader in science."
"In the late 1870's both Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray claimed to be \"the inventor\" of the telephone. Both held substantial claims to this title. Yet, conventional folk wisdom tells us that Bell invented the telephone. This paper explores one reason for this outcome: the difference in the style of invention between Bell, a professional speech teacher, and Gray, a professional inventor. Just as style is crucial in the success of an author or an artist, style is also critical in an inventor's success. Central to this study of the differences in Bell's and Gray's style is the element of science. The two inventors saw science in very different ways. Thinking that the electrical transmimion of speech was more a matter of interest to the scientific community than the technical community, Gray chose not to develop his mature ideas on how this could be accomplished. Bell, on the other hand, saw great commercial possibilities in the telephone. In developing the device, Bell not only applied what science he knew, he also used the scientific community to establish priority for his invention and to provide expert witnesses for his ideas. He achieved success in this regard because he understood the norms of science in America and followed them with perfect etiquette."
"The pattern of growth of the United States electronics industry on each of the two coasts is decidedly different. In the years 1920 to 1940, while the large eastern firms controlled the electronics market, a small group of entrepreneurs laid the basis for the present electronics industry on the Pacific Coast. The background to and the growth of this industry can be viewed as a four-stage process-developing out of an area with a colonial economy controlled by eastern United States firms to the present mature position of the electronics industry. The first three stages are discussed in this paper. Several of the most important companies in northern Calfornia have been selected for emphasis and these include both wireless and electronics companies. Stress is placed on the vertical and horizontal time relationships among these companies and the technology they relied on and modified."
"This paper recounts the adventures of the two National Television System Committees (NTSC's)in preparing monochrome and color television service for the American public. The first NTSC had the active encouragement of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Building on the important prior work of the Television Standards and Allocations Committeees of the trade association of the time, the Radio Manufacturers Association, it was able to complete its task of setting up the system standards for black-and-white television in less than nine months, from July 1940 to March 1941. These standards, with narrower tolerances but otherwise unchanged, now serve as the basis for the compatible color service now universally broadcast to the American people. The second NTSC had a rougher road to follow. The FCC, having approved an incompatible color system over strong-and strongly resented-objections of the industry's engineers, did not welcome the formation of the second NTSC. The second NTSC had, in addition to these political and institutional pressures, a very difficult technical task, one thought by many at the time to be flatly impossible: to impose high-quality color on the black and white system without injuring reception on black-and-white receivers. Combining and refining the work of many contributors, the second NTSC cogitated and tested from early 1950 to mid-1953 until it had the system we now enjoy-one that has been adopted in its essentials throughout the World. One aim of the paper is to reveal the constructive forces that led to these successes, and the near misses with defeat that were encountered on the way."
"During the first half of the 50-year period covered by this paper, the color television display progressed from crude mechanical methods and rudimentmy cathode-ray-tube ideas to a more sophisticated combination of these with a rotating color disk in front of a black-and-white picture tube. By 1950, the need to make practicable a compatible color system resulted in an intensive program to develop something better. The result was the shadow-mask color tube, which has since been greatly improved and has been outstandingly successful. Although other cathode-ray approaches succeeded techinical, they have not supplanted the shadow-mask tube commercially. For larger screen applications, projection methods are employed, both with light valves and with projection cathode-ray tubes. The future will undoubtedly see major changes, particularly in the direction of paneltype displays."
"While the struggle over the use of alternating cunent (ac) versus direct cunent (dc) in the United States lasted from 1886 to 1895, the critical year was 1888. Early in 1888 the Edison dc interests first launched public attacks on the technical aspects of ac. Later they redirected the controversy, from a general consideration of comparative merits, to concentrate on only the safety issue. The decision of dc interests to launch public attacks on ac was probably caused by the success of a French copper syndicate in cornering much of the world's copper supply and forcing prices sharply upward in 1887. This made the lower copper costs of ac systems an attractive selling point and forced dc proponents to react. Thus the early months of 1888 saw a number of well-rounded discussions on the comparative merits of the two systems. The decision in mid-1888 to focus the debate on the safety issue was related to the discovery, in the spring of that year, of a workable principle for an ac ampere-hour meter (Shallenberger) and an ac motor (Tesla). The Edison interests were largely successful in focusing the polemics on the safety issue and achieved several major publicity coups (such as the use of ac for the first legal electrocution), but they were unable to match the technical improvements that by 1895 were clearly to make ac a far better system of power transmission."
"This paper analyzes the evolution of the universal electric power system introduced at Niagara in 1895. The establishmemt of public parks at the site destroyed the former pattern of individual power consumption and made Niagra utilization a necessarily large, difficult and costly venture. The Cataract Construction Company and its engineering subsidiary, the Niagara Falls Power Company, organized - investigations to minimize the costs and problems of power development. Responding to the growth of the electrical market, the enterprise hoped to build a single electric central station that would supply electric power to consumers locally and in Buffalo, 22 miles away. Finding no satisfactory solution to the problems involved in this effort, the enterprise lacked a rudder until Swiss advances in hydro-electric technology demonstrated the feasibility of polyphase systems for the generation and long distance transmission of electric power. Niagara development quickly became a polyphase project involving an international relatioship between leading figures in polyphase technology. The turbines and alternators followed Swiss designs although the alternators were modified in a compromise between Cataract's market desires and Westinghouse's polyphase capabilities; the distribution system represented polyphase advances in America. The completed system delivered any current demanded by local or distant consumers."
"The history of railroad electrification falls into three phases that we might designate the primitive, the pioneer, and the mature. The first was the period of preliminary experiment covering the mid-Nineteenth Century. The second, concentrated in the decade of 1895- 1905, was marked by the first successful installations in Europe and the United States. The third, the age of technological maturity, grew directly out of the previous period."
"Interconnections of utilities, stimulated by shortages of power during World War I, and the availability of high-voltage transmission technology encouraged projects for regional electrification years before the TVA was established. Morris Llewellyn Cooke, a progressive and controversial engineer, and Gifford Pinchot, the governor of Pennsylvania, proposed a regional electrification plan for Pennsylvania in 1923. The plan boldly called for mine mouth power plants, by-producting of bituminous coal before firing, rural electrification, and a statewide high-voltage transmission system as a common carrier. The plan, named Giant Power, embodied far more than recent technology-it expressed economic and political attitudes as well as advocated social change through electrification. Support for Giant Power was well organized, but opposition, eapecially of the utilities, ran strong. The nontechnological impact was seen as a radical challenge to existing trends and institutions in the electric power industry. The history of Giant Power is a reminder that technology is a social concern stimulating fervid debate and dramatic confrontation."
"In the years since 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) electric power operations have passed through three phases. The first, lasting from the early days until 1941, was characterized by the construction of multiple-purpose dams, a quest for power markets and consequent battle with private companies, and innovative experiments with utility rate structures. The gamble of very low rates paid off, and well served both the goal of raising the standard of living in the Tennessee Valley and of demonstrating the possibilities inherent in sliding-scale prices. The TVA's second phase, lasting roughly from 1941 to 1961, witnessed immense growth of its power program, in response to demands imposed on the system by external conditions. WorldWar II created an emergency situation, with the Tennessee Valley an important area because of the presence of such aluminum firms as Alcoa and Reynolds, whose production facilities were largely turned over to the fabrication of aluminum for warplanes. After the war, the demands of the Cold War prompted the Atomic Energy Commission, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and elsewhere, to expand its uranium plants, and with them its demands on the TVA. The Authority thus turned to coal, and ultimately to nuclear generation, which brought about criticism from environmentalists and successive problems involving the cost of fuel. The entire story demonstrates how an institution is inevitably a volitional actor in history, and a prisoner or victim of it, as the TVA has been in its third phase, which began in 1961."
"This paper briefly reviews the history of the induction motor from its invention by Nicola Tesla in 1888 through the various stages of its development-the invention of the cast aluminum squirrelcage winding, improvements in magnetic steel and insulation, and the progressive reduction of the dimensions for a given horsepower rating, so that today a 100-hp motor has the same mounting dimensions as the 7.5-hp motor of 1897."
"The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers came into being almost one hundred years ago, calling itself in the years before the advent of electronic technologies the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. The AIEE was founded in 1884 by an active group of managers, telegraphic electricians, inventors and manufacturers, and a few professors of physical science. Just over half of the initial leadership were corporation managers and leading inventormanufacturers. From the beginning, the Institute sought to centralize and nationalize electrical knowledge in America. Through the first quarter century, members sought status through educational standards, and struggled with the restrictions of specialization. A study of the original officers and board members indicates that the first generation of electricians and electrical engineers were largely self-taught inventors. Even before their natural demise, these men were displaced by the academically trained electrical engineers; their companies were either absorbed or made useless by the corporations which took control of the industry. Thus in the AIEE itself, the original founders-inventors, telegraph and telephone company officers, and telegraph electricians-soon gave over the reins of the society to the employees of large electrical corporations. The society emerged from the explosive growth of the electrical industry. Electrical technologies, virtually ignored at the Centennial Celebration of 1876, became within ten years the basis for a powerful new industry centered on dramatic advances in electric lighting and power. AIEE was born as a consequence of the needs of modern industrial society. Its drive for professional status was a perfect response to those needs. There could be no opposition from the corporate bureaucracies since professionalism itself was a bureaucratic response to knowledge."
"The IRE was unique; it was the most scientific of American engineering societies. This spirit found expression in high membership standards, a stress upon crativity, democratic elections, and dedication to international scientific ideals. The relationship between professional standards and the style and direction of the work fostered by a professional society has not been clear historically, however. By examining a specific case, nonlinear problems, this paper shows that there was a convergence between the values implicit in the development of a highly scientific field and the professional atmosphere created by the founders of the IRE."
"As a cooperative activity of the Bicentennial Year, 1976, the present operations of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, now in its 93rd year by succession, are examined from ten viewpoints."
"Electrical engineering curricula made their first appearance in the U.S. in the early 1880's as options in physics that aimed to prepare students to enter the new and rapidly growing electrical manufacturing industry. As this industry developed, so did electrical engineering education, and within a decade made a place for itself as an equal among the older engineering departments. The curricula that evolved followed the needs of the industry, and before World War I were concentrated largely on the properties of dc and ac circuits and equipment and associated systems of power distribution. Before World War I, little graduate work was carried on, and what passed in academic institutions for \"research\" was typically advanced testing. The standard career pattern was to receive a B.S. deggee and then obtain a job where one could learn how practical electrical work was done. After World War I, developments in broadcasting and communication led to the appearance of communication options within electrical engineering departments. Concurrently, students having a special interest in teaching or in research were increasingly encouraged to obtain the master's degree. However, the numbers who did so were small, and practically no electrical engineers sought a doctor's degree. For example, at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology in 1925 there was only one member of that large faculty who held an earned doctorate, while the background of about half of the faculty consisted of a bachelor's degree plus practical experience. Under these circumstances research performed in academic institutions was in most cases superficial, although here and there some significant work was carried on by an unusual professor. When World War II came along and brought into being such new electrical and electronic techniques such as radar, microwaves, control systems, guided missiles, proximity fuses, etc., the electrical engineers were caught unprepared. As a group they had neither the fundamental knowledge required to think creatively about these new concepts, nor the research experience to carry through. Thus most of the great electrical developments of the war were produced not by engineers, but rather by scientists, particularly physicists who had turned engineers for the duration. In the decade after the war, electrical engineering education went throush a complete transformation. Prewar courses were drastically revised. Increased emphasis was placed on fundamentals, including particularly emphasis on physical and mathematical principles underlying electrical engineering. These results were achieved by reducing the time devoted to teaching engineering practice, by eliminating subjects such as surveying that were of little concern to electrical engineering, and by reducing the concentration on 60-cycle power. In addition, master's programs were developed that were direct extensions of the revised bachelor's program, and in time the master's degree became the recommended degree goal of the student who desired to follow a career in technical engineering. Concurrently, the doctor's degree became the objective of those who planned a career in academia or of research in industry, or who wanted training superior to that of their many classmates working for the master's degree. With government funds available, programs of studentfaculty research developed on many campuses that were the equal of the research being carried on in the best industrial laboratories. The combined effect of curriculum changes, more students carrying on graduate work, the existence of university research laboratories of the highest caliber with this research led by well-trained faculty aided by doctoral and master's candidates, has completely changed both the character and intellectual level of eletrical engineering on the campus. This is illustrated by the fact that in a 1969 survey of a representative group of major high technology firms, 82 percent agreed with the statement that \"Engineers now learn enough science and mathematics so that they can adequately fill positions once occupied only by physicists.\" If another world emergency should arise, the electrical engineers will this time be ready to carry their share of the leadership."
"Airborne radiotelephony was one of the most important, yet least discussed developments of World War I. It evolved from a successful organization of science and engineering created by Chief Signal Officer of the Army, Major General George Owen Squier. Under the leadership of such early notables in the history of electrical engineering as John J. Carty, Frank B. Jewett, and Nugent H. Slaughter the radiotelephone transformed the airplane from a weapon of individual opportunity to a weapon capable of centrally commanded operation. It made it possible to apply the established military principle of concentration of mass to aerial combat. This important innovation came from technical officers-primarily from those who had a vision of aircraft operating in concert. The potential of military aircraft thus conceived differed markedly from the popular image of the fighter pilot engaged in individual combat, which shared much in common with the popular view of cavalry officers in the nineteenth century. Tanks and airplanes are often regarded as the most significant weapons forged in World War I. It must be added that they attained their full significance as weapons only after being equipped with radiotelephones."
"A Consulting Engineering Department was organized by the General Electric Company in 1910. It was designed to complement the General Electric Research Laboratory through a focus on creative engineering rather than basic science. The Department was conceived and directed during its early years by C. P. Steinmetz. It continued under the able leadership of a Steinmetz protegé, E. F. W. Alexanderson, until its identity was finally lost during a reorgnization in 1951. The Department produced numerous innovations in communications, electronics and power engineering, including a world radio system that provided the technological basis for a new corporation, the Radio corporation of America, founded in 1919. The history of the Department and the philosophy articulated by Steinmetz and Alexanderson are considered from the perspective of recent studies of the nature of science and technology and their interaction."
"To develop perspective for the discussion of root-force influences shaping our culture today, a short oversimplified time-structuring review of important science and engineering developments is related to the 75-year life-spans of three individuals standing lifetime to lifetime. During the past 75 years the rising complexity and the profligate use of materials and fossil fuels have brought us to the end of our exponential growth journey. Rising chaos will characterize our socioeconomic systems until we evolve the essential brain-extension modeling means for developing adequate system understanding. We can expect to intervene intelligently only after we succeed in identifying leverage points in the system, and improve the quality of decision-making to guide the intervention and control processes. Free enterprise must be modified to permit the selection of priorities and goals. We have a choice ... either we make me of extended-brain-power and modeling techniques or we descend into a perpetual state of chaos."
"Spectroscopic measurements of the integrated intensity distributions of the radiation from turbulent ac plasmas have two sources for the appearance of turbulence: 1) the gross motion of the arc column and 2) the formation and motion of eddies."
"In this paper a method to synthesize nonlinear source antennas is outlined. Here the problem is first approximated to the corresponding one of synthesizing an antenna consisting of arbitrarily oriented dipoles, which can be solved. After obtaining the initial values of the current excitations, the antenna's shape is corrected by a regular method."
"The phase-variable representation is more advantageous for analyzing a system than the corresponding Foster's form. A unique transformation matrix yielding the former from the latter for a given transfer function is developed. The transformation may also be used to combine the simple partial fractions to yield a rational function corresponding to them."
"A recently developed method, based on A, B, C, and D parameters, deals with a generalized continued fraction interpreting its form as a driving-point admittance. This letter presents another A, B, C, and D matrix method for inverting a general continued fraction assuming its form as a driving-point impedance."
"A matrix formulation of the discrete Hilbert transform, an alternative to that given by Burris [1], is presented. This has the advantage of reducing the number of multiplications by a factor of two."
 "It is shown that a large class of nonrecurrent RC ladder networks including, as a special case, the geometric ladder networks discussed by Bhattacharyya and Swamy can be represented as an equivalent RCG ladder network."
"A procedure for determining whether or not a polynomial V(x1,x2) is positive in the region defined by a ≤ x1≤ b and c ≤ x2≤ d, is discussed, where x1and x2are real variables and a, b, c, d are arbitrary real constants. Two physically motivated examples are given to illustrate the procedure."
"The existing definitions of Q of RC notch networks are examined when applied to parallel-T RC notch networks with adjustable notch depth."
"An economical means of constructing a Fourier analyzer utgizing polarity correlation is described. Only one sinusoidal Oscillator and its quadrature function are required, but one clock is needed for each pair of cosine and sine coefficients. Included are analyses of the convergence time for a given fractional error probability and of the error variance for RC averaging."
 "Memoryless nonlinear distortion of one of two Gaussian signals, x(t) and y(t), does not induce a change in the shape of the cross-correlation function ϕxy(τ) as a function of τ (Price's theorem). A similar theorem holds for a network consisting of a cascade of three elements: a linear circuit L1, a memoryless nonlinear device NL, and a second linear circuit L2. This letter presents a proof of this property with the aim to promote a discussion on general methods by which a network of this type can be analyzed."
"The state-feedback eigenvalue control problem is studied for a class of distributed-parameter systems subject to parameter variations about given nominal values. The feedback controller derived contains two parts, namely, the nominal controller which is based upon the nominal open-loop system parameter values, and the correcting controller which is designed such as to compensate for the parameter variations. Actually, the resulting eigenvalue controller may be regarded as a controller which reduces the sensitivity of the closed-loop eigenvalues to variations of the open-loop parameters. Two examples are worked out to support the theoretical results."
"This letter outlines an approach to the problem of dimensionality reduction in the context of clustering techniques based on multidimensional histogram analysis. The approach is founded on an evaluation of the hills and valleys in the unidimensional histograms along the different features as the basis for assessing the information contained in the individual feature dimensions from the point of view of clusterability of the data set using these features."
"The Boolean difference has proved to be an elegant mathematical concept in the study of single faults of a stuck-at nature in combinational logic circuits. Recently Ku and Masson have extended this tool of analysis to cover all possible multiple-fault situations of logic circuits as well. In this letter, we have considered the problem of multiple-fault analysis through the use of the Boolean difference and derived suitable expressions that give the set of test-input codes for the detection of all possible multiple faults of combinational circuits. The developed expressions are compact and simpler, in general, and require much less computation to mire at the test vectors, particularly in cases where the multiple faults of interest are specified. These expressions, like those of Ku and Masson, are useful when only k simultaneous faults or all faults up to and including k faults are to be considered."
"The effects of mass-loading and harmonic on the resonance and antizesonance temperature behavior of a piezoelectric plate vibrator age described, in the one dimensional approximation, fog thickness- and lateral-field excitation. Applications to the AT-cut of quartz ate given."
"The electric field and abscetbed power density inside a typical human torso 1.7 m in height induced by EM waves with frequencies ranging from 10 to 500 MHz have been theoretically quantified. Some numerical examples are given. The strongest internal electric field and absorbed power was found to be induced by an EM wave of about 80 MHz with the incident electric field parallel to the torso height."

"The present status of the prospects for electric power generation with laser-driven fusion as the primary energy source is reviewed. The fundamentals of laser-fusion reactor design and attendant means of utilizing the thermonuclear energy for commercial electric power generation are discussed. Theoretical fusion-pellet microexplosion energy release characteristics and the requirements for high-energy short-pulse leasers are described. The results of analyses to assess the engineering feasibility of reactor cavities, for which protection of cavity components is provided either by suitable ablative materials, or by diversion of plasmas by magnetic fields, are presented. Two conceptual laser-fusion electric generating stations, based on different laserfusion reactor concepts, are described. Also the environmental and safety aspects of laser fusion energy systems and alternative means of fusion energy utilization, other than electric power via the conventional heat engine cycle, are briefly reviewed."
"A survey is given of the field of satellite time dissemination covering past experience, present activities, and future planned services with their respective precisions and accuracies.1Transponder satellites, clock-carrying satellites, satellite systems, and two-way satellite links are discussed."
"The concept of hologram matrix is proposed. This concept was incorporated into the design of a novel radar which, unlike conventional radars, determines the distance by the spatial distribution of the scattered wave rather than by the lapse of time. The radar based upon this principle was developed and built for the purpose of mapping ice thickness in the range of 0.5 ∼ 5 m, but it has potential applications in other fields. Such a radar has real-time processing capability, resulting from an amalgamation of the antenna and computer subsytems. The programability of the radiation pattern by software of the processing simplifies the construction of the radar. Capability of dual focussig of the transmitter and receiver eliminates the necessity of either pulsing, or frequency modulation of the transmitting signal. Superior performance in the short range, with high resolution, is particularly advantageous for measuring lossy ice. These features were substantiated by experimental results obtained from the field operation of the system."
"Motion-induced noise can be an overwhelming source of inteference in vector magnetic field sensors designed for submarine communications in the 30-130-Hz portion of the extremely low frequency (ELF) band. In the case of an ELF antenna constructed using three orthogonal superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID's) as receiving elements, the removal of motion noise is complicated by the inability of SQUID sensors to determine the absolute value of the earth's field component along the axis of the sensor. An equation is derived that expresses the projection of the ELF signal vector on the earth's field in terms of the SQUID outputs, and an adaptive vector that is approximately equal to the earth's field vector. Two adaptive schemes using the methods of process parameter estimation are described which determine the adaptive vector. The Least Squares method requires no initial estimate of the adaptive vector but is an open-loop method which tends to be slow. The second adaptive scheme, the steepest descent method, is a close-loop technique that has the potential of being rapid, but requires an initial value of the adaptive vector that is close to the true value. Both techniques remove, to first order, sources of noise arising from sensor nonorthogonality, sensitivity differences and dc offset errors. From a computer simulation of both techniques, it is found that the optimum system is a combination of the two methods, using the Least Squares method for estimation of the coarse value of the adaptive vector, and using the Steepest Descent method for fine adjustment."
"A state-of-the-art discussion of heterostructure injection lasers is presented. These lasers are first considered as configurations of uniformly pumped semiconductor slabs that constitute the transmission medium of multilayered slab waveguides, whose boundaries are trapless heterojunctions. Emphasis is on lasers whose electrically active and waveguiding layers are AlxGa1-xAs or GaAs, although several other semiconductors are discussed. Single, double, and separate confinement hetrostructure lasers, all of which yield carrier and optical confinement normal to the plane of the heterojunctions, are described. Lateral electrical and optical confinement in various stripe geometry double-hetrostructure lasers is illustrated. In addition to the more common Fabry-Perot cavity lasers, there are now also several new varieties that use corrugated surfaces as Bragg gratings for internal distributed feedback or reflection. Some of these heterostructure lasers have permitted the demonstration of CW-room temperature injection lasers with low threshold current densities (< 1000 A/cm2), low dc current (∼15 mA), long lives (>105) h), and a considerable degree of control over modes and beam divergence. In addition, the use of heterostructures has permitted the demonstration of the first integratedoptical structures that include both active light generating and passive elements on a single chip."
"This letter proposes that the high-capacity kinetic energy storage afforded by present superflywheels can be combined with an ac/dc/ac power-electronic converter system to provide unique stable economic energy transfer as needed from the variable-speed storage unit to the fixed-frequency utility grid."
"A remote viewing experiment was conducted with a group of 36 persons who successfully identified, without apparent sensory communication, a target location chosen randomly and visited by two observers (p = 6 × 10-7). Success is partly attributed to procedures designed to facilitate remote viewing abilities: asking participants to give themselves permission to have the ability, forming the group into two-person teams of viewer and coach, discussing resistances, and giving instructions on generating mental imagery and impressions."
 "In preliminary research designed to test the \"remote viewing\" paradigm of Puthoff and Targ, two university art classes drew their impressions of an unknown, randomly determined location. Based on the drawings, independent judges attempted to select the correct locations from among ten slides. The results (P = 0.03), although not conclusive, were encouraging."
"A series of remote viewing experiments were run with 12 participants who communicated through a computer conferencing network. These participants, who were located in various regions of the United States and Canada, used portable terminals in their homes and offices to provide typed descriptions of 10 mineral samples. These samples were divided into an open series and a double-blind series. A panel of five judges was asked to match the remote viewing descriptions against the mineral samples by a percentage scoring system. The correct target sample was correctly identified in 8 out of 33 cases; this represents more than double the pure chance expectation. Two experienced users provided 20 transcripts for which the probability of achieving the observed distribution of the percentage score by chance was 0.04. These results confirm earlier reports of successful remote viewing experiments while extending them to cases in which participants were thousands of miles away from each other and in which the targets were mineral samples of potential economic significance, with control of communications provided by a computer network."

"The author had the major responsibility for developing a new concept for an electrical laboratory with the aid of industrial grants at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. A description of the laboratory designed to meet specific objectives is covered in the referenced literature. Emphasis is placed on the teaching of the physical understanding of the internal behavior of transformers and rotating machines. Information windings designed into the small machines, accompanied by analog computing elements, provide the basis for the \"shape measurement\" philosophy of the laboratory. Details of many unique experiments with typical recorded results dealing with transformers, induction and synchronous machines, and some system phenomena are included. For example, the two components of the total excitation current of a transformer are isolated and recorded individually under steady-state and transient conditions for any line voltage and load. The rotating field is extensively explored and other experiments relate to the slip between the rotatiag field and the rotor of an induction motor. The sudden loading of synchronous machines reveals the transient behavior of internal power, instantaneous speed, and rotor position. The most complex experiment involves ferroresonance in a system consisting of a synchronous generator and a capacitance compensated transmission line terminated in a three-phase transformer bank."
"We derive a broad range of theoretical results concerning the performance and limitations of a class of analog adaptive filters. Applications of these filters have been proposed in many different engineering contexts which have in common the following idealized identification problem: A system has a vector input x(t) and a scalar output z(t)=h'x(t), where h is an unknown time-invariant coefficient vector. From a knowledge of x(t) and z(t) it is required to estimate h. The filter considered here adjusts an estimate vector h^(t) in a control loop, thus d/dt h^= KF[z(t)-z^(t)]x(t) where z^(t) = h^'x(t), F is a suitable, in general nonlinear, function, and K is the loop gain. The effectiveness of the filter is determined by the convergence properties of the misalignment vector, r = h - h^. With weak nondegeneracy requirements on x(t) we prove the exponential convergence to zero of the norm ||r(t)||. For all values of K, we give upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate which are tight in that both bounds have similar qualitative dependence on K. The dependence of these bounds on K is unexpected and important since it reveals basic limitations of the filters which are not predicted by the conventional approximate method of analysis, the \"method of averaging.\" By analyzing the effects of an added forcing term u(t) in the control equation we obtain upper bounds to the effects on the convergence process of various important departures from the idealized model as when noise is present as an additional component of z(t), the coefficient vector h is time-varying, and the integrators in a hardware implementation have finite memory."
"Due to some applied problems of recent interest significant effort has been devoted to developing the technology of the transient and broad-band electromagnetic response of various objects such as antennas and scatterers as well as the production mechanisms for such transient fields. This paper addresses the various types of approaches which have been used for understandiag such transient/broad-band properties. While initially various approaches aid in analysis of such fields, in some cases other properties of the approaches lead to more powerful results such as synthesis of transient/broad-band properties."
"A new interference pattern in the angular distribution of the potential of a pulsating point charge in a drifting magnetoplasma is reported. The measurement of the interference spacings of this interference pattern can give an estimate for the drift of the plasma."
"An analysis is made for the susceptance of two narrow transverse strips of differing widths and depths, unsymmetrically located in a rectangular waveguide. The analysis is based on extremization of the current-density ratio between the two strips, through use of the variational principle. The results are experimentally verified."

The phenomenon can be employed to prevent mode jumpings due to power supply-switching transients in such oscillators, without having to use narrow-band interdigital transducers."
"A multiamplifier RC active network is described which utilizes both low-pass positive feedback and Miller effect techniques to reduce the capacitance required for very low frequency operation. It is shown that the network, which has both low-pass and bandpass filter capabilities in addition to an oscillator mode, is primarily suitable for low to moderate Q factor applications."
"An operational amplifier (OA) RC realization of a high-Q inductor is presented. The circuit uses two OA's in unity gain connections, two grounded condensers, and three resistors. It is characterized by low sensitivity and good high-frequency performance. The active inductor, being open-circuit unstable, is suitable for tuned circuit and oscillator applications."
"Experiments have been performed to determine the feasibility of achieving storage densities greater than 107/in2using MNOS capacitors.

"This paper presents a method of designing wave digital bandpass (BP) and bandstop (BS) filters whereby the center frequency and bandwidth can be independently controlled by simply changing the multiplier values. Also given are the canonic realizations for the BP and BS wave digital filters. This method of designing BP and BS wave digital filter results in a saving of coefficient registers."
"An active near-infrared laser scanner has been used to electronically map the temperature variations over the active regions of silicon interdigitated UHF transistors operating in the hot-spot regime. The principle makes use of the increase in electron-hole pair generation by the absorbed laser light with increasing temperature. The regions of enhanced photoresponse are displayed on a cathode-ray-tube display screen. Extensions to other devices and operating conditions, other than those which result in hot-spot operation, are suggested."
"A laser scanner employing a modulated low-power 0.633- µm He-Ne laser has been used in a nondamaging manner to locate portions of a silicon bipolar UHF transistor which electrically behave in a nonlinear manner at a signal frequency of 470 MHz. In effect, the method uses the device scanned as a frequency converter to produce an IF output for a display screen whenever the laser spot is incident on nonlinear regions."
"The expression for source-drain characteristics of a thin-film transister with linearly graded channel thickness is presented based on a depletion-type operating in an enhancement mode. The saturation voltage derived from the I-V expression was found to decrease significantly, as compared to uniform channel having comparable semiconductor film thickness as the source end of the graded channel."
"The fraction of residual transmitted pump power following backscattering of the backward-traveling-wave (BTW)-type parametric interactions such as stimulated Brillouin scattering has a characteristic asymptotic exponential decay with pump excitation. This scattering mechanism may very well constitute an inherent limiting factor in pump penetration into an interaction medium."
"This letter presents a jitter reduction technique for the digital phase-locked loop proposed by G. Pasternack and R. L. Whalin. In this technique, the lower N bits of load data from the first register are cut down and loaded into the final register as the round-off data. According to the experimental results, rounding off 5 bits in the second-order loop causes jitter to be reduced by 19.5 dB; therefore, this technique is useful for carrier tracking applications."
"An earlier paper described an algorithm for power system state estimation exploiting decoupling between active and reactive equations and including an estimation of regulating transformer ratios. An improvement which avoids repeatedly calculating the gain matrices is described. Execution times are decreased by up to 80 percent."

"Structure functions are apparently unfamiliar to most engineers and the unifying role they play in oscillator instability theory has largely gone unrecognized. This paper introduces and places into perspective the role which Kolmogorov structure functions have in theory. It is demonstrated that the rms fractional frequency deviation (phase accumulation) introduced by Cutler and Searle is related to the first phase structure function; the two-sample Allan variance is related to the second phase structure function. In addition, it is shown how the two-sample Allan variance is related to the rms fractional frequency deviation under suitable conditions. The L-sample Allan variance is also identified in terms of the first phase structure function; it is shown to be an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the rms fractional frequency deviation squared if the latter existL The utility of higher order structure functions of frequency and phase in the theory of instability is also demonstrated; in particular, how the frequency drift and \"flicker\"-type noise convergence problems can be overcome."
"The theory and recent applications of waves in periodic structures are reviewed. Both the Floquet and coupled waves approach are analyzed in some detail. The theoretical part of the paper includes wave propagation in unbounded and bounded active or passive periodic media, wave scatterring from periodic boundaries, source radiation (dipole, Cerenkov, transition, and Smith-Purcell) in-periodic media, and pulse transmission through a periodic slab. The applications part covers the recent development in a variety of fields: distributed feedback oscillators, filters, mode convertors, couplers, second-harmonic generators, deflectors, modulators and transducers in the fields of integrated optics and integrated surface acoustics. We also review the work on insect compound eyes, mehanical structures ocean waves, pulse compressions, temperature waves, and cholestric liquid crystals. Particles interaction with crystals is briefly reviewed, especially in the case of zeolite crystals and supelattices. Recent advances in fabrication techniques for very fine gratings me also covered. Finally, speculations about future problems and development in the field of waves in periodic structures are given."
"One of the many problems in high-speed ground transportation is supplying the necessary power to the vehicle, as on-board power generation is not attractive due to the rapid increase in the power requirement with speed. Power collection with a sliding pantograph becomes increasingly difficult as train speed increases. Alternative methods of contactless power collection are critically reviewed in this paper. It is concluded that power collection along the line using an electric arc appears to have the best advantages. A study of the literature has shown that arcs can be driven magnetically at speeds higher than 500 km/h without being extinguished, and that electrode wear at high arc speed is relatively low. The known problems of arc initiation and reignition at high speeds are not insurmountable in the light of present day experience and techniques in this area. The results of an experimental investigation of power collection by an electric arc which is being carried out at the University of Sheffield are also included. The electrode geometry plays a significant role in the arc maintenance, and interelectrode gap changes from 1 to 10 cm can be tolerated without reduction in arc lifetimes under certain conditions. Experimental results on electrode wear which is affected by arc current level, arc speed, and the electrode material, are presented. These show that the damage to the overhead wire is at an acceptably small level."
"Binary sequences of length n = 2m- 1 whose autocorrelation function is either 1 or -1/n have been known for a long time, and are called pseudo-random (or PN) sequences, or maximal-length shift-register sequences. Two-dimensional arrays of area n = 2lm- 1 with the same property have rcently been found by several authors. This paper gives a simple description of such sequences and arrays and their many nice properties."
"The extension of the ray equations to include absorbing media depends on the definition of the relevant group velocity. A method by Suchy has been condemned to be nonunique. It is the purpose of this note to clarify this point."
"The application of quasi-static techniques in the characterization of microstrip is very important in the overall development of integrated circuits. Various analytical and numerical methods have been used to calculate the static potential, the capacitance, and/or the characteristic impedance of a microstrip structure. In this letter, a simple formulation is presented for the computation of static field of dielectric bodies. Through the definitions of static scattering, static reaction, an operator equation based on the equivalent surface charge distribution is obtained. This letter presents the basic mathematical techniques for reducing functional equations to matrix equations. The surface formulation can be easily modified to handle static field problems of magnetic bodies."

"The design of optimal digital fiters to minimize the mean-square error is well known and can be obtained by solving [Sud(z)/Su-(z)]+/Su+(z). However, the decomposition of [.]+ by partial fraction expansion, unlike the analog case, may not yield the optimal filter. In this letter, this problem is discussed."

"A new type of voltage breakdown occurring in high-voltage D-MOS transistors is described. This effect severely reduces the high-voltage capability of these devices when the gate field plate is extended through the drift region toward overlapping the n+drain contact region. The breakdown is shown to be due to an avalanche phenomenon appearing close to the n+region, due to the very high field induced in this NIOS structure in nonequilibrium. A first-order theory is developed to confirm the conclusions of the experimental study."
"The influence of preparation parameters and the effect of X-rays (150 keV, 104rad (Si)) on oxide charge Qoxand interface state density Nssin thermally oxidized MOS varactors under different biasing conditions during irradiation has been investigated. The interface state density was determined by the ac conductance method before and after irradiation. The oxide charge has been evaluated with regard to the charge Qssof the interface states. Qsshas beeu discussed with the aid of simple models concerning the energetic distribution and recharge character of the interface states. The results indicate a similar dependence between flatband voltage, interface state density, and normalized oxide charge density as a function of gate bias during irradiation. Furthermore, the so-called \"oxidation triangle\" of oxide charge before irradiation exists for interface states as well. Calculations on the basis of the Schottky barrier model of the irradiated MOS structure show that the radiation-induced charge exists at both interfaces in the oxide layer. Radiation tolerance of the MOS capacitors as a function of technological parameters is discussed."
"For the normal solar cell geometry, there is shown to be an upper limit to the cell conversion efficiency for each value of the silicon substrate resistivity. This limit cannot be exceeded regardless of possible improvements in material lifetime properties. It peaks for a value of substrate resistivity of about 0.1 Ω.cm for p-type substrates corresponding to an acceptor concentration of 7 × 1023m-3. The limit can be exceeded if the cell structure is modified. A high-low junction incorporated near the ohmic back contact to a suitably designed device not only improves the current collecting properties for a given cell thickness, as has been shown previously, but also increases the ultimate conversion efficiency."
"p-channel MOSFET parameters measured at 300 K, 77 K, and 4.2 K are discussed; these include I-V characteristic curves, channel conductance, transconductance, threshold voltage, field effect mobility, and forward and reverse p+n junction characteristics. Some qualitative explanations of the dependence of the data on temperature and substrate doping concentration are given. Interesting LHe phenomena are highlighted and discussed in terms of accepted solid state models."
"An E-shaped Gunn-effect device is proposed as a high-speed logic gate. It is composed of two Gunn diodes connected by a gate section which is located between the two diodes adjacent to the common cathode. Along the gate edge, an ohmic electrode is established to control the electric field at the gate section. It is fabricated into monolithic circuitry of GaAs, and its performance is found to be in good agreement with the result of a computer simulation. From this, it is concluded that the transverse extension of a high field domain can be controlled by changing a potential on the ohmic gate, which allows this device to be employed as a binary logic gate performing Z = X + Y.∼W (X, Y, W: binary inputs). The delay time of about 50 ps has been obtained with the gate width of 100 µm. For the convenience of designing a smaller device in order to reduce the delay time, a result of small signal analysis on the two-dimensional domain initiation is given. Also referred to is an H-shaped Gunn device which is profitable if considerable delay is required in performing the above-mentioned logic operation."
"A simplified computer model of a TRAPATT (trapped plasma avalanche triggered transit) diode was developed and is used to investigate realistic voltage-current waveforms (i.e., waveforms that produce negative conductances at all signal frequencies). Oscillator efficiency variations due to fundamental and second-harmonic current tuning were studied. The computed waveforms show good agreement with the TRAPATT waveforms obtained experimentally."
"The I-V characteristics and optical properties of (AlGa)- As p-n heterojunctions, with a larger bandgap on the n side, were studied. The discontinuity of conduction bands, tilted by the space-charge electric field, produces a spike-notch structure. At comparable low doping levels on both sides of the heterojunction, the notch is empty at zero-bias conditions and acts as a trap for injected electrons. Thermal injection into the p-type region becomes the predominant current mechanism after the notch has been filled with electrons. The notch population is a step function of the applied voltage and determines an S-shaped I-V characteristic. Radiative recombination and ac photocurrent under dc bias gives further support for the existance of captured electrons in the notch."
"Results which show that surface dislocation loops in GaAs may be moved by the application of high electric fields are presented. These results show the feasability of a degradation mechanism for high-field GaAs devices based on the multiplication of dislocations by the piezoelectric stresses produced in the material."
"From a technical point of view, improvements of conventional color picture tubes could be regarded as having reached their limits. In this respect, we have found that the mask-focusing tube can achieve further improvements when combined with the black-matrix technique, a high-performance gun, dot screen structure, high-matrix transparency, and large gun electrode diameter. Two-fold improvements of brightness and contrast have been obtained with mask transparency twice that of conventional tubes, 22-percent higher matrix transparency, and mask-focusing. A 20-30 percent less deflection power has also been achieved with 110° deflection, neck diameter, and 1:2 mask-focusing voltage ratio. A 20-percent less spot diameter and a sharp beam distribution have been obtained by a new multistage-focusing electron gun in a delta arrangement in the 35.5-mm neck diameter."
"A two-dimensional mathematical model is developed to predict the internal behavior of power transistors operating under steady-state conditions. This model includes the internal self-heating effects in power transistors and is applicable to predict the transistor behavior under high-current and high-voltage operating conditions. The complete set of partial differential equations governing the bipolar semiconductor device behavior under nonisothermal conditions is solved by numerical techniques without assuming internal junctions and other conventional approximations. Input parameters for this model are the dimension of the device, doping profile, mobility expressions, generation-recombination model, and the boundary conditions for external contacts. Computer results of the analysis of a typical power transistor design are presented for specified operating conditions. The current density, electrostatic potential, carrier charge density, and temperature distribution plots within the transistor structure illustrate the combined effect of the electrothermal interaction, base conductivity modulation, current crowding, base pushout, space charge layer widening, and current spreading phenomena in power transistors."
"Transferred-electron amplifiers (TEA) are finding applications where medium powers are required as driving stages. Most work has been done up to now under small-signal conditions. The present paper describes theoretical results of a large-signal analysis. From this analysis, it appears that different large-signal behaviors of TEA devices can be associated with their corresponding dc field distribution. We compare, by computer analysis, the evolution of the large signal impedance with the RF driving signal for different doping profiles (different stationary fields) and give design figures to increase the device added power."
"The disadvantages of semiconductor strain-gage transducers are nonlinearity and temperature sensitivity. Using a monolithic integrated circuit Wheatstone bridge on a silicon cantilever enables linearization by variation of the location or width of the sensing devices. Excellent temperature stability is achieved by the integration itself and an additional external resistor."

 "This paper summarizes the status and potential of charge-coupled device (CCD) memories. Cost-performance tradeoffs for serial memories are reviewed, and the CCD chip organizations for slow and fast access systems are discussed. Comparisons are made between CCD and MOS random access memory (RAM) chips on the basis of cell area, support circuits, cell operation, and technology."
"This paper describes a 16 384-bit serial charge-coupled memory device designed primarily for low cost and compatibility with existing high-volume manufacturing techniques. To obtain low access time, the device was organized as 64 recirculating shift registers each 256 bits long. Any one register can be selected at random for reading or writing, by means of a 6-bit address input. The alternatives considered in choosing the charge-coupled device (CCD) structure and chip organization are discussed. Data regeneration circuits are described in detail. The device was fabricated on a silicon chip, with an area of 2.07 mil2/bit (including all peripheral circuitry). It operates at data rates exceeding 2 MHz, and has a minimum average access time of under 100 µs."
"A 9216 bit NMOS/CCD memory organized as 1024 words by 9 bits is described. It employs a buried channel two phase charge-coupled device (CCD) storage cell combined with n-channel silicon gate Isoplanar (TM) MOS technology for logic functions and TTL compatible interfacing. Techniques of charge detection by using internally generated reference voltages are detailed. A low noise CCD input writing scheme and a dynamic sense-refresh cell are descried. Input-output logic is given that permits operating modes of read, write, read-modify-write, and recirculate. Operation at the specification limits of 100 kHz and 2 MHz is shown."
"A new practical form of charge-coupled device (CCD) memory structure is described which achieves high storage density while providing low clock-line capacitance. In the new structure, the time-division multiplexing of multiphase concepts is replaced by the spatial multiplexing of a serial-parallel-serial (SPS) array. By using a ring counter to generate the multiphase clocking, a compact method of clock generation is described which allows the integration of multiphase drivers into the memory array. The improved density results from using a multiphase technique while the low clock-line capacitance stems from integrating the necessary drivers into the memory structure. The average bit density of the new structure including all necessary drivers exceeds that of previously discussed CCD memory structures when similar layout rules and gate electrode configurations are applied. A 4096-bit memory chip was built to fully demonstrate the new multiphase serial-parallel-serial storage (MSPS). The memory chip additionally uses serial decoding to increase the ratio of bit storage area to decoding circuitry area. The memory chip performed all memory functions of READ, WRITE, and REFRESH. The memory is organized into 16 separate 256-bit CCD shift registers. It is also found that interlacing is effective in increasing the average bit density in MSPS structures. The combination of high density and low drive capacitance makes the MSPS structure appear attractive for memory applications."
"A 16 384-bit charge-coupled device (CCD) memory has been developed for mass storage memory system application where moderate latency, high data rate and low system cost are required. The chip measures only 3.45 × 4.29 mm2(136 × 169 mil2), fits a standard 16-pin package, and is organized as four separate shift registers of 4096 bits, each with its own data input and data output terminals. A two-level polysilicon gate n-channel process was used for device fabrication. A condensed serial-parallel-serial (CSPS) structure was found to provide the highest packing density. Only two external clocks are required driving capacitances of 60 pF each at one-half the data transfer rate. Operations at data rates of 100 kHz to 10 MHz have been demonstrated experimentally, the on-chip power dissipation at 10 MHz being less than 20 µW/bit."
"This paper describes the design and performance of a 16- kbit charge-coupled serial memory device. The memory is organized in four blocks of 4 kbits each with on-chip decoding and is mounted in a 16-pin ceramic dual-in-line hermetic package. Each 4-kbit block is organized as a serial-parallel-serial (SPS) array. Operated at a data rate of 1 MHz the mean access time is 2 ms and the on-chip power dissipation is calculated to be 1.5 µW/bit with another 0.5 µW/bit being required in off-chip clock drivers. The maximum designed output data rate is 10 MHz. Compared to the serpentine and loop organized memory charge-coupled device (CCD), the SPS organization has the advantages of lower power dissipation, greater tolerance to process parameter variations, and higher output data rate. All inputs and outputs are TTL compatible. Write/recirculate control is provided on the chip as well as two-dimensional decoding to permit memory matrix organization with X, Y chip select control. All the on-chip peripheral circuits use dynamic MOS circuitry to minimize power consumption. The charge sensing on the chip is achieved with balanced regenerative sense amplifiers. The memory array uses the three-phase three-level polysilicon electrode structure, and the chip is fabricated using an MOS n-channel polysilicon gate process with self-aligned source, drain, and channel stop."
"This paper describes the design and performance of a 64-kbit (65 536 bits) block addressed charge-coupled serial memory. By using the offset-mask charge-coupled device (CCD) electrode structure to obtain a small cell size, and an adaptive system approach to utilize nonzero defect memory chips, the system cost per bit of charge-coupled serial memory can be reduced to provide a solid-state replacement of moving magnetic memories and to bridge the gap between high cost random access memories (RAM's) and slow access magnetic memories. The memory chip is organized as 64K words by 1 bit in 16 blocks of 4 kbits. Each 4-kbit block is organized as a serial-parallel-serial (SPS) array. The chip is fully decoded with write/recirculate control and two-dimensional decoding to permit memory matrix organization with X-Y chip select control. All inputs and the ouput are TTL compatible. Operated at a data rate of 1 MHz, the mean access time is about 2 ms and the average power dissipation is 1 µW/bit. The maximum output data rate is 10 MHz, giving a mean access time of about 200 µs, and an average power dissipation of 10 µW/bit. The memory chip is fabricated using an n-channel polysilicon gate process. Using tolerant design rules (8-µm minimum feature size and ±2-µm alignment tolerance) the CCD cell size is 0.4 mil2and the total chip size is 218 × 235 mil2. The chip is mounted in a 22-pin 400-mil wide ceramic dual in-line package."
"A new concept in MOS dynamic RAM cells is described and demonstrated. The charge-coupled RAM (CC RAM) cell combines the storage capacity and transfer gate of the one-transistor cell into a single gate. The resulting cell is simpler than the conventional one-transistor cell and possesses significant advantages in packing density and potentially higher yield. One of the variations of the CC RAM cell concept results in a cell whose operation is identical (voltage and timing) to that of the present one-transistor cell. In addition, the CC RAM cell fabrication is essentially the same as the present one-transistor cell process. The CC RAM is an attractive candidate for the next generation RAM's."
 "Some of the design considerations for charge-transfer split-electrode transversal filters are discussed. Clock frequency, filter length, and chip area are important design parameters. The relationship of these parameters to filter performance and accuracy is described. Both random and tap weight quantization errors are considered, and the optimum filter length is related to tap weight error. A parallel charge-transfer channel, which balances both capacitance and background charge, and a coupling diffusion between split electrodes greatly improves accuracy. A one-phase clock is used to simplify the readout circuitry. Two off-chip readout circuits are described, and the performance of two low-pass filters using these readout circuits is given. Signal to noise ratios of 90 dB/kHz and an overall linearity of 60 dB have been achieved with this readout circuitry."
"The operation and design of 500-stage charge-coupled device (CCD) transversal filters are described. The filters have been mask programmed for implementing two spectral analysis techniques: 1) bandpass filtering and 2) Fourier analysis using the chirp z transform (CZT) algorithm. The bandpass filter has a measured fractional 3 dB bandwidth of 0.0108 and 38 dB sidelobe rejection. The dynamic range is 75 dB with less than 45 dB total harmonic distortion. A sliding transform is defined which is useful for calculations of the power spectral density and is shown to be particularly advantageous in a CCD-CZT implementation. Using the sliding transform, a 500-point spectrum is calculated using CCD's with resolutions which can be varied from 1-200 Hz. The dynamic range of the power spectral output was measured to be 80 dB. A discussion is given of the performance limitation of a general CCD filter due to the inherent characteristics of the device. The results are evaluated for the 500-stage devices described above and indicate that sample rates from 25 Hz to 10 MHz are possible with a dynamic range approaching 100 dB while retaining high linearity."
"Some experimental and practical considerations of performing convolution or transversal filtering with charge-coupled devices (CCD's) using optical inputs are described. The basic principle involves shining light from a signal-modulated light-emitting diode (LED) onto an optical mask which controls the amount of light reaching the various CCD electrodes. The experimental results for a 91-tap Hamming window are presented. The relative advantages of using this approach as a means of obtaining fixed tap-weight transversal filters are discussed in comparison with the split electrode CCD filter. It is shown that a compact lens free optical signal processor is possible, using standard imaging structures. Although there is a disadvantage in terms of the need for an LED and current driver, this may be outweighed in certain contexts by improvements in linearity, intermodulation, dynamic range, and the scale of processing which is possible."
"A filter bank having up to 32 channels is formed by multiplexing a recursive two-pole delay line filter. Thirty-two sets of filter constants are stored and addressed digitally while multiple delays are provided in analog form by a charge-coupled device (CCD) delay line. The interface between the digitally stored constant and the delayed analog signal occurs in a four quadrant multiplying D/A where the delayed analog signal is weighted by the constant. Sampling and clamping at the CCD interfaces insures accurate bipolar analog operation. The filter hardware is described, the filter constants are derived, and the performance is documented."
"Charge-transfer devices (CTD's) offer new opportunities in analog signal processing since they provide analog memory in integrated circuit form. In this paper the successful application of serial charge-transfer structures to radar and to electronic countermeasure systems is described. The design and operation of a three-pulse, 50 dB clutter-suppression charge-transfer radar moving target indicator (MTI) and the implementation of a charge-transfer memory for radar electronic countermeasures (ECM) are discussed, and experimental results are presented."
"Methods are presented for combining charge-coupled device (CCD) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) techniques to advantage for processing coherent radar signals in order to extract target range and velocity information. Experiments have validated a scheme of combined discrete CCD's to form an analog store with orthogonal input and output sequencing, feeding time-compressed data to a SAW spectrum analyzer. A design for an integrated CCD store is presented."
"A dual differential charge-coupled analog device providing signal delays of 24 and 48 elements has been designed for sampled data analog signal processing applications. The aim of this design was to eliminate some of the disadvantages that have been associated with previous charge-coupled devices (CCD's). These include clock pickup, thermally generated dc offsets, and complex external control and amplification circuitry. The device has an input strobing circuit and an on-chip output amplifier. With a clock frequency of 8 kHz and a 400-mV rms input signal, the total harmonic distortion was below 0.2 percent and the signal-to-noise ratio was better than 70 dB with a 4-kHz bandwidth. The device gain was 6 dB and a gain variation of 0.2 dB was observed over a temperature range of 0 to 55°C."
"A brief review is given of the advances in solid-state imaging during the last ten years. The issues of surface channel versus buried channel, aliasing versus prefiltering, frame transfer (FT) versus interline transfer (IT) versus charge-injection device (CID), and direct view versus EBIC imaging are discussed. Time-delay-and-integration (TDI) and infrared imaging are discussed. Finally applications are considered."
"A charge-coupled image sensor of the vertical frame transfer type has been fabricated with three-phase three-level polysilicon electrodes. The device has 496 vertically interlaced rows of elements and 475 resolution elements/line. The imaging area, measuring 12.8 × 9.6 mm2, corresponds to that of a 1-in vidicon. Defect-free devices have not yet been fabricated, but with an appropriate effort such devices seem feasible. The device is operated in a self-contained camera, measuring 6 × 6 × 15 cm, containing the countdown circuitry, and implemented with commercially available TTL. The clock line drivers are built with discrete transistors. The camera produces a suitably filtered black-and-white video signal in the standard 525-line television format, which includes the necessary blanking periods and synchronization signals. Large-scale integration (LSI) of these circuits could readily lead to a camera which could be smaller by more than a factor of two."
"The charge-injection device (CID) imaging technique employs intracell transfer and injection to sense photon-generated charge at each sensing site. Sites are addressed by an X-Y coincident-voltage technique that is not restricted to standard scanning. Free-format (random) site selection is possible. An epitaxial structure provides a buried collector to prevent recollection of the injected charge. In sequential injection, the charge is injected into the substrate and the resulting displacement current sensed. In parallel injection, the functions of signal charge detection and injection have been separated. The injection operation is used to reset (empty) the charge storage capacitors after line readout has been completed. Nondestructive readout (NDRO) is possible by deferring the injection operation. Low-loss NDRO operation has been achieved using a cooled imager. High sensitivity, low dark current, high modulation transfer function (MTF), and low blooming are some additional advantages of sensing signal charge levels within the array. Compared to the charge-coupled device (CCD), the CID approach results in a relatively high output capacitance; however, this is not considered to be a performance-limiting factor for most imaging applications."
"The use of metal oxide transparent conductive electrodes in a charge-injection device (CID) imaging array has resulted in a quantum efficiency of approximately 70 percent, uniform throughout the visible, with useful array response out to 3500 Å. The advantages of using highly transparent metal oxide electrodes for the fabrication of frontside illuminated arrays is described. A new high density CID cell is described, which does not require any contact windows or diffused regions. This cell structure is simply composed of two crossed rows and column electrodes and is easily fabricated. Because no contacts are required, it can be reduced in size for large high density arrays. The results for a 32 × 32 self-scanned array are presented."
"A new configuration of the charge-injection device (CID) image sensor is described in this paper. Readout is performed by means of buried stripes (e.g., p stripes in an n-type substrate) acting as collectors of the injected minority carriers previously stored under the gates. This scheme provides separate paths for the displacement and diffusion currents and consequently improves the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Furthermore, the new configuration yields simple X-Y selection without the need for extra crosspoint switches. In the present device, a word organized readout is achieved by means of polysilicon stripes perpendicular to the buried p stripes. The silicon area therefore can be used very efficiently."
"An IR sensitive, charge-coupled linear imaging array using palladium-silicide Schottky-barrier detectors has been designed, fabricated, and tested. Thermal scenes as low in temperature as 110° C were imaged. It was shown theoretically that in the vidicon mode of operation, nonuniformities in the transfer process and in detector capacitance do not degrade the video signal. Good uniformity was indeed obtained in this mode. A scheme for removing the background signal from the detectors before loading into the charge-coupled device (CCD) was incorporated into the design of the chip, and operation in this mode was also demonstrated. This imager, though made with a single level of metallization with gaps, had reasonably good transfer efficiency and is free of smearing and blooming."
"In this paper we discuss the noise measured at the output of a buried channel charge-coupled device (BCCD) linear shift register. The measured noise arises from four sources; the electrical insertion of signal charge, the output amplifier, dark current, and bulk state trapping. In making these measurements the concept of correlated double sampling was used in an output circuit which had a noise level which was equivalent to less than 3O noise electrons. A critical component in this output was a low noise MOSFET which was achieved by use of the buried channel technology. A low noise input structure for electrical insertion of signal charge was used which introduced a signal which had a noise level which ranged from less than 10 e-to as high as 60 e-depending on the size of the signal charge. The dark current noise was found to be well characterized as a shot noise and levels on the order of 20 e-were measured. The above low noise levels made possible direct measurement of the noise due to bulk state trapping, and depending on the signal size and clock rate noise levels were measured which ranged from less than 10 to over 100 noise electrons. One of the most important bulk traps was found to be due to gold impurities which had a density of ∼ 2 × 1011cm-3."
"One of the possible causes of a finite charge-transfer inefficiency in bulk charge-coupled devices (BCCD's) is the presence of bulk traps in the n-type silicon layer through which the charge packets are transferred. To determine the relative importance of the contribution of traps, we measured charge transfer inefficiency as a function of temperature. In most of the devices investigated, this measurement results in two broad peaks due to the presence of traps at 0.25 and 0.54 eV below the conduction band edge. The concentration of these traps varied from batch to batch between values of 5 × 1010cm-3and 1 × 1012cm-3."
"A measurement of charge-transfer efficiency (CTE) is described for a 256-element charge-coupled linear imaging device operated below room temperature and at a very low total charge level per charge packet, that is, at a level of approximately 1/20 000th of saturation. This measurement was carried out at a register frequency near 15.75 kHz, the standard television-line frequency. CTE was measured by noting the dependence of the size of the principal charge packet upon the number of transfers. It was observed that at a dark current level of 4 electrons per packet and a photosignal level of 15 electrons the signal loss through approximately 250 transfers was 1 ± 5 electrons at the 50 percent confidence level. A signal-averaging technique was used to obtain this small probable error in the measurement. An analysis has been performed which assumes bulk trapping as the limiting mechanism and from which it may be concluded that to the same probable error the bulk-trap concentration in the CCD channel region is less than 4 × 1012cm-3for trap energies in the range between 0.23 and 0.32 eV below the conduction band. This result demonstrates the possibility of developing a 500 × 500 element charge-coupled imaging device which would have satisfactory CTE for signal levels as low as approximately 10 electrons per picture element."
"The performance and technology of the twin-layer PCCD has been investigated for different doping levels of the surface layer. With respect to charge transfer efficiency and charge handling capacity, optimum conditions for the doping level of the surface layer can be established."
"Theoretical calculations are made of low frequency transfer inefficiency for the conductively connected charge-coupled device (C4D). Two mechanisms for transfer inefficiency arise in the C4D which are not found in correctly operated charge-coupled devices (CCD's) but are found in bucket brigade devices. These are 1) barrier length modulation and 2) diffusion over the barrier. Theoretical analyses are made for both of these mechanisms, and both are found to be significant (∼0.05 percent/transfer for a 5/µm barrier) and independent of frequency. The transfer inefficiency increases sharply as feature size is reduced but decreases as oxide thickness is reduced. The fabrication and testing of C4D's with barrier lengths in the range 1.75 µm to 5 µm are described, and the measured transfer inefficiencies compare well with theoretical predictions."
"The use of the offset-mask technique to fabricate two-phase and uniphase charge-coupled device (CCD) electrode structures is described. A new two-phase electrode structure with polysilicon-electrodes and self-aligned gates for the peripheral circuits has been developed. The electrode structure is well sealed and has a high performance. Transfer inefficiencies of 1.5 × 10-4and interface state density of 1 × 109cm-2. eV-1have been measured on n-channel 256- element two-phase devices. The developed polysilicon offset-mask electrode structure is very attractive for charge-coupled memories. Compared to other two-polysilicon level CCD structures, it has a higher packing density, is more tolerant to intralevel shorts, and does not require large numbers of small contact windows to connect the gate electrodes to the phase bus lines."
"A simple high-linearity charge-injection technique for charge-coupled devices (CCD's) is described, analyzed, and practical results presented. The technique is of the potential equilibration type and utilizes the formation of a potential barrier and charge-storage site under one CCD electrode adjacent to an input diode. This obviates the need for an input clock, as used in previously reported surface potential equilibration charge-injection techniques, by isolating a fixed quantity of \"supply charge\" from the input diode and the CCD transfer electrodes. The analog signal is applied to the succeeding CCD electrode and depending upon its amplitude some, or all, of the supply charge is transferred to under this electrode, and by subsequent CCD action through the register. A theoretical analysis of the technique predicts that nonlinearity vanishes as the effects of the depletion region capacitance are eliminated. In practice, however, a small nonlinear effect, being mainly attributed to charge \"slopping,\" does occur, causing a reduction in the useful dynamic range of the device for a particular level of linearity. Experiments have indicated that a useful dynamic range of 47.5 dB is attainable with all harmonic components at least 45 dB below the fundamental with a total harmonic distortion of less than 1.2 percent. Variations in threshold voltages between different input stages does not effect the quantity of charge injected (within certain operating limits), but does result in small variations of the maximum useful dynamic range of the devices. The technique is particularly suited to two-phase CCD's because it allows linear charge injection, charge transfer, and reset sensing to be accomplished using only one clock."
"New methods for linear launching, weighting, and nondestructive charge sensing in charge-coupled devices (CCD's) are described. These methods employ electronic circuitry at the input and output nodes of the CCD, which linearize the signals, eliminate the nonlinear effect of depletion region capacitance and are also independent of device parameter variations such as electrode area, and absolute values of threshold voltage and oxide thickness. Results indicate a maximum nonlinear distortion of 2.4 percent which is equivalent to a second harmonic distortion level of-38 dB if all distortion present is assumed to be due to second harmonic distortion. Significantly better results are believed possible with circuit optimization. These methods are directly applicable to many CCD signal processing systems and are particularly aimed at CCD transversal filters."
"Of the many technologies available to implement efficient and stable charge-coupled devices (CCD's), most employ a multilevel metal, overlapping gate approach. As a consequence, the CCD process becomes generally more complex and the resulting overlap capacitance can be embarrassing for serial memory applications. This paper describes a single level aluminium gate process, the notable features of which are simplicity, extremely high yield, low interphase capacitance, and very high packing density. Interelectrode spacings in the range 2000 Å-5000 Å are achieved. The performance capability is described in the context of an analog delay line."
"The solution of the equations which determine the potential profile in bulk channel charge-coupled devices (BCCD's) in the presence of a nonuniform fixed impurity concentration and mobile charge in the channel is quite complex. A major simplification results from the assumption that the mobile charge completely neutralizes the fixed impurity charge over a region of space surrounding the potential minimum. It is shown in this paper that, based upon physical argumentS, this assumption must give results accurate to within 0.1 V for the value of the potential minimum. Further, it is possible to accurately predict the region in the channel within which virtually all of the free charge must reside. Thus these two important design parameters can be deduced from the simple depletion approximation with an accuracy good enough for most practical applications. The validity of the physical argument is demonstrated by the close agreement of results based upon this approximation with results obtained on the same structures by numerical integration, Comparison is also made with results previously published by other authors. Agreement is generally satisfactory but in some cases the discrepancies are greater than can be readily explained."
"Improvement in lithographic resolution will enable designers to reduce the area of charge-coupled device (CCD) memories. However, if only lateral dimensions are scaled down, the transfer inefficiency will increase. The transfer inefficiency is determined primarily by surface states or by barrier-modulation effects. A scaling procedure is described which will allow transfer inefficiency to be unchanged as the cell size is reduced by scaling other CCD parameters such that the normalized potential distribution under the gates is maintained. The normalized potential distribution can be maintained in two ways: 1) constant gate voltage scaling, which has the advantage of better S/N (because higher charges are handled) but is limited by electrical breakdown and 2) constant field scaling which avoids this limit but has a poorer S/N. A sample calculation shows that signal deterioration at smaller cell sizes is still dominated by the transfer-inefficiency effects rather than the noise effects."
"A multiplexed filter structure using a single charge-transfer device (CTD) with 2N stages of delay, switched weight values, and two adders can be used to implement a bank of N second-order recursive filters. Structures of this type can be combined to implement a bank of higher order recursive filters, offering a potentially economical realization for multichannel filtering applications. An important limitation of the CTD delay line is due to the effect of charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), which introduces dispersion to the frequency response of the delay stages. By viewing the multiplexed structure as a multichannel filter with N inputs and N outputs, general expressions for the N2transfer functions can be derived which exhibit the dependence on the coefficient ε of CTI. For small ε, the asymptotic deviation of the transfer functions and the poles of the transfer functions from their desired behaviors (when ε = 0) is examined. In particular, for the case where the N desired second-order filters have distinct poles, e.g., filters tuned to different resonant frequencies, it is shown that the pole positions are perturbed by a term of the order of εN, indicating that the effect of CTI is negligibly small. Included in the paper are results on the asymptotic dependence on ε of the interchannel crosstalk due to CTI."
"A Green's function solution to the two-dimensional electrostatic problem with a planar dielectric discontinuity is formulated. The Green's function for a planar boundary is calculated, and hence this calculation applies only to the case where all gates lie in a plane. The assumption is also made that there is no charge in the oxide. The formalism is then applied to the calculation of the surface potential of a four-phase charge-coupled device (CCD). The calculation involves fairly straightforward integrals over the gates, semiconductor surface, and depletion region."
"A three-phase charge-coupled device (CCD) technology with three levels of polysilicon and trichloroethylene (TCE) oxide-silicon nitride gate, having a good processing yield and taking full advantage of the self-aligning property of silicon gate transistors, is presented. The use of a TCE gate oxide results in a storage time between 3-4 min, measured on the CCD itself. The presence of the silicon nitride requires a suitable combination of low-and high-temperature anneals in order to decrease the density of fast surface states. A reliability problem observed at high clock voltages is attributed to trapping of injected hot carriers in the gate insulator."
"A new charge-coupled device (CCD) input circuit is described which is threshold correcting in the same manner as a pulsed-diffusion input. Unlike a pulsed-diffusion input, this circuit does not require special clock pulses. The input is used to construct a four register, 1024-word, multiplexed device that requires only two clock signals. The frequency response and fixed-pattern noise performance of the register is discussed. Uses for the device include high-speed, high-density analog memories."
"A simple linear surface-potential equilibration-type input scheme is described. With this input scheme, only one clock is required to operate a two-phase charge-coupled device (CCD) with overlapping electrodes. A linear input range and high-frequency capability are demonstrated using this input scheme."

 "The problem of electrostatic separation of a layer of charged particles of small size compared with the layer thickness was studied. The particle layer initially is confined between two electrodes, and experiments were carried out on a dispersion of particles in a liquid to determine the mass fraction remaining on each electrode after electrode separation. The dependence of the mass fraction on particle charge and applied potential was measured. A physical model was formulated and found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements."
"One of the important problems in the development of ac plasma panels is to produce panels that maintain stable characteristics for a long time. A new idea for using a protecting layer over the dielectric layer which isolates the electrodes from the gas was examined and good results were obtained. Moreover, besides stability, a considerable improvement of operating characteristics was achieved, including low-voltage operation capability. Sputtering of the protecting layer, which is thought to govern the life of plasma panels, occurs even to heat-resisting oxides of large binding energy, but the sputtering rate appears to be so slow that it hardly affects the panel life. Also, the rate of decomposition accompanying sputtering is small. The problem of cracks in the protecting layer, which is the cause of defective life characteristics in such respects as migration of the lead component of the dielectric layer onto the protecting layer and the direct exposure of the dielectric-layer glass to the discharge, was solved by process-technique improvements. This paper describes the merit of using a protecting layer, required performance for this layer, and experimental results, and discusses voltage stability and the results of selection of materials for it."
"The discharge-time lag in an ac plasma display panel was studied and the discharge phenomena in the cells were considered. As a result, it was confirmed that time lag characteristics are unique in ac-driven capacitively coupled discharge elements and that such characteristics have a decisive effect on the dynamic characteristics. It was further clarified that the secondary emission coefficient γ of the protection layer determines the time lag characteristics and it is an important determining factor of the dynamic characteristics. As a result of the study of the effect of γ, it was possible to confirm that high γ leads to high performance and, accordingly, MgO is appropriate as protection-layer material."
"Achieving overall stability of the ac plasma display/ memory device is vital to solving major problems to secure maintenance-free operation in its practical use. The stability improvement reported in this paper has been achieved by improving driving waveforms for the panel. The main improvements were: finding an address-pulse shape suitable for the panel characteristics, applying a proper address sequence, and the use of an addressing method free from half-select failure. These techniques have enabled us to obtain a wide operating margin in character-display application."
"The surface-discharge type plasma display panel does not require accurate spacing between two plates. Also, the number of manufacturing processes can be reduced to nearly half those required for opposed-discharge-type panels, resulting in low cost. The relationship between the principal design factors of a surface-discharge-type panel and the firing voltage in the nonmemory mode is discussed, based upon experiments and calculations from an equivalent circuit. Furthermore, by making use of the fact that one side of the panel is simply a cover glass for the gas space, it is possible to obtain green emission by coating a phosphor on the inside surface of the cover glass. In this arrangement, degradation of the phosphor by ion bombardment seldom occurs and long life panels can be achieved."
"The feasibility of a new three-terminal linear power amplifier has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally from 0.5 to 3.0 GHz. The new amplifier is similar to an n-p-n bipolar transistor in configuration but develops extra power gain through avalanche multiplication and by the use of transit time in the collector. Major differences in the construction of the two devices are in their collector doping profiles and depletion layer widths. It is estimated that this new amplifier will be capable of several watts of power output at 10 GHz with useful gain, good linearity, and wide dynamic range. An acronym, CATT, which stands for controlled avalanche transit-time triode, is used to designate this new microwave semiconductor device. In this paper, the theory of the CATT is developed. It is found to be dc and RF stable. The necessary conditions on the ionization coefficients for signal amplification are investigated. The emitter-base dynamics of the CATT are shown to be quite different from a transistor due to hole feedback from the avalanche multiplication region. This phenomena results in a more uniform emitter current injection and better use of the emitter finger area than for transistors."
"A design and processing technique allowing fabrication of devices with very small junction capacitances is presented. Emitter and base areas of the smallest device, called a microemitter, are reduced to about 3µ2and 12µ2, respectively, and a comparison is made with larger geometries fabricated on the same wafer. Ion implanted microemitter devices have fT= 4.8 GHz at currents as low as 100 µA and peak fT= 7.0 GHz and should allow a great improvement in the speed-power product of ECL circuits. Emitter injection appears to approach the behavior of a point source, and it is observed that the rate of fTfalloff with current density is lower for the microemitter than for larger geometries. This effect may make these devices also useful as microwave transistors."
"A new approximate analysis of the linearly graded p-n junction is developed which gives solutions for the space-charged density and mobile carrier densities as distributions within a finite space-charge width. The results obtained are in good agreement with the true unbounded solution of Poisson's equation and represent a considerable improvement in space-charge modeling over previous approaches to approximate \"regional\" analysis. The solution process is implemented numerically as a computer algorithm in terms of either the total junction space charge or the applied voltage as a parameter; it is appropriate for application in the analysis of devices by the regional method where modeling of space-charge and mobile carrier distributions is required. Results are presented for the space-charge density distributions of linearly graded junctions; also for the space-charge capacitance and total junction capacitance including the high forward bias region."
"Using the time domain analysis of Lagrangian approach, the small-signal behavior of a semiconductor with field-dependent mobility under various contact conditions is analyzed. A generalized closed form solution for an impulse current response is derived when the carrier velocity characteristic is expressed by a piecewise linear function. This result gives an accurate description of the transient performance of the device and can provide good insight into device operation. Numerical examples are given for a negative differential mobility GaAs crystal, considering the conditions under which negative resistances occur. A generalized small-signal impedance of the semiconductor is given, from which previous results reported for particular devices can be obtained as special cases."
"The voltage variable capacitor has been used in tuning circuits for some time. The hyperabrupt varactor diode is fabricated to yield an especially steep capacitance-voltage characteristic under reverse bias conditions. An analysis of this diode yields an analytical expression for capacitance versus applied reverse bias which agrees remarkably well with the experimentally determined C-V curves."
"Schottky-barrier microwave mixer diodes of GaAs have been fabricated in a novel epitaxially grown high resistivity guard layer configuration. These devices are capable of withstanding RF pulse energies of up to 2 ergs with no deterioration in noise figure performance. Such high resistance to RF spike burnout is attributed to device planarity and passivation resulting from the integral guard layer design."
"A new bipolar-type semiconductor switching device is proposed, fabricated by two diffusion processes and without any isolation technique. The device has an n+-diffused small electrode instead of a gate electrode in the MOS transistor structure. This device can have high photo sensitivity in the charge storage mode operation."
"Different gold concentration profiles in thyristors result in different switching behavior. The injected carrier concentration profiles which can be obtained from the local recombination radiation intensities give insight into these effects."
"It is demonstrated that the Ic-VBEtransport characteristics of a narrow-base bipolar transistor can be accurately computed using the regional approach if an appropriate characterization of the effects of mobile carriers in the emitter space-charge region is employed, but that neglect of such effects can lead to serious errors. A new method of approximate analysis for a linearly graded p-n junction is utilized for this purpose, giving results that are in close agreement with those of full computer simulation of the device structure."
"Properties of the sweep oscillation mode of GaAs IMPATT diodes in the millimeter-wave region are studied in comparison with Si IMPATT diodes. In spite of their narrower depletion width, the GaAs diodes oscillate at lower frequencies than the Si devices. This can be explained by using the newly measured drift velocity of GaAs."
"The scattering-limited drift velocity vsnof electrons in an avalanching GaAs diode is estimated by measuring the space-charge resistance. The result shows a lower value of vsn(5.7 ± 0.3) × 106cm/s than the generally accepted value 8 × 106cm/s at room temperature. The temperature dependence of vsnis also measured."
"A method of making ohmic contact to n-type GaAs by means of micro-alloying at 320°C for 90 s, resulting in a specific contact resistance of approximately 0.1 Ω.cm2is described. This technique involves an aluminum overlay which prevents puddling and thus maintains contact geometry. Such contacts, having a relatively high specific contact resistance, have the advantage of being formed by low temperature micro-alloying for short times."

"Design theory and experimental results of the WRITE and ERASE properties of a rewritable and nonvolatile avalanche-injection-type memory are reported. The memory transistor has the stacked-gate structure of a floating gate and a control gate. The threshold-voltage shift of the transistor due to injected charge is controlled by applied potential on the control gate which reduces the avalanche breakdown voltage of the drain junction and accelerates electron injection into the floating gate. The writing time is about 20 µs for a single transistor and is less than 5 s for a fully decoded 2048-bit memory with appropriate duty cycles of programming pulses. Erasure of the memory is accomplished either by ultraviolet light irradiation onto the floating gate or by electric field emission of electrons from the floating gate to the control gate. Electrical erasing is theoretically analyzed and successfully compared with experimental results on the 2K bit memory. Memory retention is also investigated and a charge-escaping model is proposed."
"A design consideration for an X-band GaAs power FET, features of the fabrication process, and electrical characteristics of the FET are described. Interdigitated 53 source and 52 drain electrodes and an overlaid gate electrode for connecting 104 Schottky gates in parallel have been introduced to achieve a 1.5-µm-long and 5200-µm-wide gate FET. A sheet grounding technique has been developed in order to minimize the common source lead inductance (L8= 50 pH). The resulting devices can produce 0.7-W and 1.6-W saturation output power at 10 GHz and 8 GHz, respectively. At 6 GHz, a linear gain of 7 dB, an output power of 0.85 W at 1-dB gain compression and 30-percent power added efficiency can be achieved. The intercept point for third-order intermodulation products is 37.5 dBm at 6.2 GHz."
"Previous studies have yielded good qualitative understanding of noise characteristics in IMPATT diodes under large-signal conditions. However, a coherent approach to describing correlation effects in a rigorous manner and demonstrating their relationships to AM and FM noise spectra has been lacking. The present work is intended to fill this need in the framework of a Read diode model with small back-bias. Autocorrelations and noise spectra are periodic functions of time in large-signal operation. Resulting correlation effects are quantified and shown to cause unequal AM and FM noise spectra. The short-circuit spectrum of the avalanche current is calculated and found to have resonant terms at the harmonics of the large-signal frequency. A matrix relationship with the open-circuit avalanche field spectra is derived. Simple analytical expressions are developed for these spectra by considering the interactions between the low-frequency and fundamental-frequency amplitudes. The AM and FM spectra have noise poles at the differential and the large-signal avalanche frequencies, respectively. The open-circuit noise spectra of the diode voltage are used to study noise properties of IMPATT amplifiers and oscillators. Conditions for noise stabilization are discussed. The AM and FM voltage spectra are coupled unless these conditions are met. Numerical results for the noise measures and noise-to-carrier ratios versus signal level are presented. The AM noise is found to be smaller than the FM noise when large bias resistance is used to suppress upconversion of low-frequency noise into the AM spectrum. Strong increases are found in the FM noise measure versus signal level. Previous theories are discussed, and the connections with the present work are established. A new large-signal IMPATT model is introduced to study the effects of the reverse saturation current on the efficiency and the noise measure. The present theory should be useful in designing diodes for optimum power-noise performance owing to the simplicity and the minimum of restrictive assumptions in the derived analytical expressions."
"The exposure time of an X-ray lithography system is minimized by the appropriate choice of X-ray wavelength and target excitation voltage, within the constraints of a specified resolution and contrast in the exposed resist pattern. The factors that must be considered in making this choice are the X-ray source brightness of various target materials, the continuum emission spectrum of the target, the wavelength-dependent transmission of the X-ray mask and the vacuum window, and the wavelength-dependent absorption in the resist. The relative exposure time, as a function of wavelength, is predicted for a system using a 25-µm-thick beryllium window and PMMA resist with three choices of mask substrate: 12.5- µm-thick Mylar, 4.0-µm-thick silicon, and 8.5-µm-thick beryllium. A new mask substrate, 0.2-µm-thick aluminum oxide, is presented and shown to be suitable for exposure in vacuum with a 2.5-µm-thick aluminum filter at 13.3-Å wavelength (copper target). X-ray emission spectra from an aluminum target were measured at electron energies of 4.5, 7.9, 10.4, 12.5, 15.5, 19.5, and 28.5 keV. These spectra showed that the continuum radiation contributes little to the degradation of contrast with a gold-on-silicon X-ray mask. Thus a 20-kV electron beam may be used for maximum X-ray production efficiency."
"Results are presented for both theoretical and experimental analyses of low-level avalanche multiplication in an insulated gate field-effect transistor (IGFET). The theoretical model is derived from the ionization integral using a linear field approximation for the electric field at the drain. Experimental multiplication factors are determined by measuring channel and substrate currents. The model is shown to lead to reasonable agreement with data in the range of multiplication factors defined by (Mn- 1) less than unity."
"The effects of the thickness of the semi-insulating substrate as well as the effects of surface recombination and surface charges are studied concerning the performance of planar Gunn diodes with the aid of a digital computer."
"A novel method is described for constructing an acsustained gas-discharge display (plasma panel). Electrodes and insulating layers are applied alternatively on a single base substrate to produce a matrix of insulated crossovers. A second clear substrate is used to contain gas on the electrode side of the base substrate where glow discharge occurs. As in conventional two-substrate panels, internal memory is obtained by charge storage on the dielectric. The pulsed write and the sustain mechanisms of single- and twin-substrate display elements are discussed with regard to the effects of cell and field geometries. In the sustain mode, glow-propagation effects are observed, especially in the nonhomogeneous fields of the single-substrate design. Here cathode-type glows which form a narrow band are observed with a high-speed photomultiplier and shown to sweep across the dielectric surfaces. Luminance, intensity distributions, and luminous efficiency data are compared on small 10 × 10-line panels using single-substrate and conventional designs. A three- to four-fold improvement in luminance is achieved with the single-substrate geometry."
"Electrooptical switching of LED's is shown to be well described by a very simple equivalent circuit, the decisive elements of which are the diffusion capacitance and the lead inductance. Theory and experimental data indicate that even small lead inductances diminish performance if the LED is driven by a low-impedance source. Using a switched current source instead is likely to give the fastest possible response. The application of a reverse current pulse to the LED will reduce the light-fall time below the value given by the diode time constant. Then the carrier storage time and the light-fall time are found to be identical, thus offering a simple method of determining the latter without use of a photodetector."
"This article presents some results from a study concerned with the trade-off between efficiency of numerical computation and accuracy of numerical models for semiconductor devices. The approach taken in this study was to use nonuniform grids in the finite difference equations approximating the semiconductor partial differential equations. A constrained minimization problem was formulated which analytically optimizes the numerical models. Several performance functions were found useful in optimizing the numerical models; the one presented here matches computed and \"exact\" terminal current responses. An example is presented to illustrate the results obtained with this performance function. The example model optimization shows that the optimized grids should have their greatest density in the space-charge region near the junction. An interesting side result is that when one performance function is optimized, apparently other desired features are optimized for numerical models for semiconductor devices. The Fletcher-Powell optimization algorithm was used with an adjoint gradient algorithm specifically developed for this study, without which the use of nonuniform grids would not have been practical."
"This article presents some results from a study that was concerned with the trade-off between efficiency of numerical computation and accuracy of numerical models for semiconductor devices. The approach taken in this study was to use optimized nonuniform grids in the finite difference equations approximating the semiconductor partial differential equations. This paper presents a second choice of performance function that allows a minimization of the truncation error made in the difference approximation to the continuous equations. The truncation error approach is more elegant and more useful than the terminal current approach reported in Part I [7]. An example is presented to illustrate the results obtained with the truncation error performance function. A significant side result is that when the truncation error is minimized, then all other desired features are optimized for the numerical models for semiconductor devices."
"This study is aimed at helping to design X-band CW transferred-electron oscillators with higher performance. Temperature rise in devices operating in the accumulation layer mode is analyzed both with heat sink negative and heat sink positive. Efficiencies and output powers in both polarities are calculated and compared. The calculation shows efficiency in CW operation is drastically improved by quantitatively controlling the doping profile to account for the temperature profile and further governed by carrier concentration times layer thickness (n × l) product and diode size. For the heat sink negative, output power over 800 mW is predicted from a single-mesa conventional structure, using a wafer with an n × l product of 2.0 × 1012cm-2and doping profile increasing, toward the substrate (away from the heat sink), by 30-35 percent across the active layer. For the heat sink positive, an almost flat profile is suitable and output power over 1.5 W is predicted for a diode with a doping increase of 10 percent across the active layer toward the substrate. The calculations are substantiated experimentally by diodes with n × l products of 1.5-2.3 × 1012cm-2and doping increases of 20-70 percent across the active layer toward the substrate heat sink negative operation."
"An electrostatic deflecting lens (EDL) return-beam, electron-camera readout system has been developed and tested. The unique features of the system are the following: 1) there is no field stopping mesh used, therefore, ultra-high resolution becomes possible; 2)the normal landing condition is obtained by making the deflection center coincide with the focal point of the final lens; 3) a large number of beam spot diameter scans are obtained; and 4) magnification factor of the system M is smaller than one. The system was tested at electron landing energies from 70 V to 14 kV. In a 2.86 cm × 2.86 cm raster scan, the typical on-axis modulation transfer function (MTF) at a spatial frequency of 100 lp/mm is 0.67 for high-energy landing and 0.55 for low-energy landing. The linear scan is better than 7000 spot diameters at high-energy landing and around 6000 at low-energy landing. The test results indicate that with some design modification, the EDL system can be used for low-energy surface-scanning electron-microscope (SEM) applications."

"The characteristics of a new hybrid amorphous-crystalline three-terminal device are described in detail. The device uses a threshold-switching-type chalcogenide glass as the emitter, with a p-type crystalline-silicon base and an n-type silicon collector. When the amorphous emitter is in the off state, the small-signal current gain is significantly smaller than unity. However, once the voltage across the glass is sufficient to produce the on state, the device operates as a transistor with gains well in excess of unity. (Small-signal gains of up to 15 have already been observed in unoptimized configurations.) Under certain conditions, the high-gain on state can be preserved after the switching pulse is removed, suggesting memory-type applications. Previous results on amorphous-crystalline heterojunctions are used to construct a band model for the transistor. This model is used to analyze the steady-state and pulsed-mode characteristics of the device. Recent studies of the on-state current density and carrier concentration are used to calculate the expected gain as a function of current and base doping concentration, with results in good agreement with the experimental data. The behavior of the devices provides another confirmation of the electronic nature of threshold switching in chalcogenide glasses."
"The frequency response of epitaxial GaAlAs single-heterojunction light-emitting diodes was investigated as a function of active-layer hole-concentration and diode area. The modulation bandwidth can be considerably increased by high doping, but an upper limit is imposed by the space-charge capacitance of the diode. Further improvement of the frequency characteristics can be realized by reduction of the diode area. The highest 3-dB modulation bandwidth achieved in this investigation was 100 MHz."
"Transient behavior of switching diodes based on space-charge overlapping has been analyzed. The delay time was derived analytically and compared satisfactorily with experiments on amorphous threshold switches."
"This paper reports the fabrication of low parasitic capacitance planar beam-leaded structures by means of a novel new technology. The structure is produced by the simultaneous deposition of single crystal and semi-insulating polycrystalline gallium arsenide utilizing the molecular beam epitaxial process. Schottky barrier millimeter wave mixer diodes fabricated with the polycrystalline isolated material have shown normal dc characteristics and substantially reduced parasitic capacitance. Devices measured in a double-balanced downconverter circuit showed a conversion loss of 5.3 dB at 51.5 GHz and 8.5 dB at 103 GHz. This is in excellent agreement with the theoretical conversion loss predicted from the dc characteristics. These devices exceed the performance of structurally identical devices fabricated on conventional n on n+material by about 2 dB. Since layers of virtually any desired doping concentration can be produced, the material is potentially applicable to a wide range of devices."

"The interaction impedance of coupled cavity slow wave structures can be measured by perturbing the resonances of a shorted length of the structure using a dielectric rod. An analysis of this procedure is presented. The analysis retains radial as well as axial electric fields and all significant space harmonics. The results obtained are easily programmed formulas for calculating total interaction impedance or Pierce impedance using the experimental data."
"A model for computing the thermal transient response of a diamond-heat-sinked IMPATT diode has been formulated as a means for accurately predicting the degree of heating or cooling of the junction when the diode is pulsed into or out of avalanche. The model consists of an electrical network analog for the heat conduction process, and the transient analysis of this network has been performed using the IBM Advanced Statistical Analysis Program (ASTAP). Also incorporated into the model are the results of previous numerical determinations of steady-state temperature distributions in IMPATT diamond heat sinks. The thermal responses for diode turnon and turnoff and for power surges have been found for several different designs of IMPATT diodes, both Si and GaAs. Turnon transients calculated with this model have been compared with transients calculated by a published method [11] involving a transcendental equation. The two models were roughly in agreement. However, because the previously published method neglects the heat flow path through the chip, it yielded lower values than the network analog model described here for the junction temperature in the first few microseconds after turnon of the diode. The results of these calculations showed that the transient response varied depending on the size of the chip and that significant temperature changes occurred in time intervals ranging from less than 0.1 µs to several microseconds for practical diodes. The results also showed that a description of the transient response in terms of a simple time constant is not meaningful, because the early response does not approximate an exponential curve. To provide a means for making quite accurate desk calculations of diode thermal transients, two approximations have been derived which can be used without computer programs."
"Expressions for the photovoltage and photocurrent of a strongly illuminated p-n junction solar cell are derived by solving the ambipolar diffusion equation. A complete boundary condition is derived for the junction, which is valid for all levels of injection. In the open-circuit case, results are in agreement with those given by earlier theories, while in the short-circuit case, the current is found to saturate at the ratio of the diffusion potential to the internal resistance. Results are used to explain the experimental results of earlier workers."
"The application of layered addressing to gas-discharge displays has recently been demonstrated in the multi-layer gas-discharge panel. This paper describes the addressing principles and gives the addressing parameters for an 8-layer experimental panel, including voltage waveforms, current and bias levels, and impedance requirements. The extension of these principles to large panels, which require partitioned reservoirs, is described."
"Implanted-diffused As layers in Si have been well-characterized and have been used in fabricating low-voltage n-p junctions. It is shown that these As layers form linearly graded junctions with a uniform B-doped background (ρ ≃ 0.006 Ω.cm). The grade constant of the As profile at the junction is known sufficiently well as a function of As dose, diffusion time, and temperature to allow quantitative use of existing tunneling and avalanche theories for the calculation of the reverse I-V curves. Following a verification of the calculated I-V curves and their temperature dependence as a function of grade constant, calculated curves are presented which correlate As implant dose and diffusion with junction breakdown voltage, breakdown impedance, and temperature coefficient of reverse voltage. The temperature coefficient is shown to change from negative to positive as the transition from tunneling to avalanche occurs. In addition, the relative importance of tunneling and multiplied-generation current as a function of current density is elucidated for any particular As layer grade constant."
"Substantial improvement in the reproducibility of extremely efficient S-band TRAPATT diodes is shown to result from sputtering layers of silicon oxynitride onto the exposed surfaces of the mesa diodes. The sputtered layers stabilize the device against changes in dc current-voltage characteristics induced by the TRAPATT mode."
"InP FET's with active layer doping of 1017donors/ cm3have limiting values of fTroughly fifty per cent higher than those of equivalent GaAs devices for lengths ranging from 0.5 µm to 3 µm at 300 K, and from eighty percent to forty percent higher in this gate length range at 77 K."
"Gallium phosphide was anodically oxidized in an aqueous H2O2solution and MOS diodes were fabricated by the evaporation of aluminum. The resistivity and electric breakdown strength were higher than 1014Ω.cm and 6 × 106V/cm, respectively. Almost no frequency dispersion was observed in the C-V curves from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The C-V curve showed the injection-type hysteresis. From the hysteresis window, the transferred charged carriers were estimated to be about 9 × 1011/cm2. By leaving the diode biased at negative voltage or by shining light with energy higher than 1.8 eV, the curve shifted to negative voltage direction. The results indicate that the density of the fast interface states which follow the 100-Hz signal is very low but there exist deep electron traps with activation energy higher than 1.8 eV near the surface in the oxide film and the shallower electron traps which cause the hysteresis in the dark."
"An MOS transistor is described in which the source and drain areas are obtained by diffusion from doped polycrystalline silicon. Polysilicon tracks form the interconnect with the diffusion areas without the need for contact windows. As a result transistor and junction sizes are reduced by a factor 2 or 3 over a normal structure. Polycrystalline silicon tracks in this new technique are of greater advantage as interconnect layers than in the silicon gate tecgnique."
"A procedure is introduced for measuring an effective density of defects that takes into account time-dependent dielectric breakdown in MOS devices. Measurements are obtained that show a surprising exponential decrease in this density with decreasing oxide thickness."
"MOS capacitance measurements showed that the Si-Ta2O5interface prepared by thermal oxidation at ∼530°C of vacuum deposited Ta film followed by a heat treatment at 350°C in N2-H2is characterized by a negative \"oxide\" charge (6 × 1011e/cm-2at flat-band) and by an interface state density of ∼ 1 × 1012cm-2(eV)-1. The room temperature instability is small. The breakdown strength is >8 × 106V/cm."

"Accurate cross-sectional views of large scale integrated circuits are useful for failure analysis and process evaluation. We have successfully prepared thin sections of finished devices cut perpendicular to the plane of the chip and examined them using transmission electron microscopy. We describe the sectioning procedure and show some cross-sectional views from memory cells of a CMOS RAM with poly-Si gates and tungsten second metal. Examples include micrographs of sections through 1) an IGFET showing the gate edges and the poly-Si grain size distribution, 2) metal to Si, and metal to poly-Si contacts, and 3) poly-Si runners. Each circuit element examined was uniquely identified by mapping the cross section through adjacent memory cells and noting the sequence of elements intersected. This demonstrated ability to examine cross sections of finished devices, consisting of multilayers of materials with different densities, hardness, etc., should prove useful whenever detailed device geometries, crystalline structures, etc., need to be examined in a manner which is relatively free of experimental artifacts."
"The use of polycrystalline Se as the photosensitive target of a vidicon image tube has been demonstrated for the first time. The mode of operation of this target layer is fundamentally different from that of the amorphous-Se vidicon target, which is commonly described as a photosensitive insulator layer. In contrast, the explanation for the crystalline-Se vidicon operation, as proposed here, is based on the utilization of a reverse-biased heterojunction contact between n-type SNO2and p-type crystalline Se. A fabrication process has been developed which yields target layers with an attractive combination of operating characteristics. This new type of vidicon has the following nominal operating parameters: dark current ≃ 5-10 nA, peak sensitivity ≃ 0.270 A/W, peak quantum efficiency ≃ 60 percent, and 50-ms lag ≃ 10 percent. Compared to the standard Sb2S3vidicon, this experimental crystalline-Se vidicon has more than twice the sensitivity and less than half as much lag and dark current."
"Experimental observations (electrical characteristics and in depth Auger analysis) have been made of the interface behavior in aluminum-silicon contacts. The barrier heights of these contacts (φbnfor n-type, φbpfor p-type silicon) are sensitive to heat treatments (HT) that are a part of normal integrated circuit processing. If oxide layers (≃20 Å) are present in the Al-Si interface, φbncan be as low as 0.45 eV and φbpas high as 0.75 eV. One can obtain reproducible barrier heights φbp≃ 0.7 eV and φbp≃ 0.5 eV by HT at T ≤ 300deg;C. As the temperature of HT is increased (up to ≃ 550deg;C) φbncan reach ≃ 0.9 eV and φbpdrop to < 0.35 eV. The HT at higher temperatures are accompanied by changes in the Al and Si profiles across the interface region. Two mechanisms have been found to be responsible for the changes in barrier height: 1) the removal of positive charges from the oxide, and 2) metallurgical reactions between the Al and Si. These two mechanisms have been separated and their individual behaviors qualified."
"A new model is proposed for the drain conductance of J-FET's in the hot electron range. The model is based on a physical picture revealed through two-dimensional numerical analysis. The two-dimensional analysis shows that the electron concentration changes gradually at the boundary of a depleted region which is defined by a conventional theory. Because of this gradual change, electrons can remain after the pinch-off and contribute to the drain current. Although the high electric field causes the electron velocity to saturate, the drift velocity vector rotates into the x axis (source-to-drain) with the increase in the drain voltage. The increase in the x component Vxof the drift velocity gives rise to a small increase in drain current, that is, a finite drain conductance. The proposed model takes into account the above two essential features, gradual change in electron distribution, and the rotation of the velocity vector. This model is constructed in a single formulation which describes the current-voltage characteristics from the linear to the saturated drain-current region. Theoretical calculations agree quite well with the experiment on GaAs Schottky barrier gate FET's."
"The MZOS (metal-zinc oxide-silicon dioxide-silicon) structure is investigated in order to provide a phenomenological understanding of the charge transfer and trapping properties of the zinc oxide layer. Results of fast-ramp measurements of capacitance versus voltage are presented, and on the basis of these results, some biasing and operating procedures are suggested to make effective use of the memory capabilities of this configuration or to avoid unwanted memory effects. A technique for optical imaging is described which offers several advantages over other surface wave imaging techniques. Finally, some potential applications are mentioned."
"The quenched multiple domain mode of oscillation is proposed in GaAs Gunn diodes. Operating conditions for this mode are explored by means of a computer simulation and a simplified linearized-lumped analysis that was developed to generate waveforms for quenched domain devices. Optimum efficiency is seen when a maximum number of \"hybrid sized\" domains are packed into a device which is operated at the transit frequency associated with the width of a domain. By reducing the voltage across a device, nonhybrid sized domains form and the device operates at less than peak efficiency. The investigation includes a discussion of device performance when nonidentical but comparably sized domains are present in the device. Experimentally, multiple domain devices have been fabricated using diodes with coplanar contacts. The experimental results tend to confirm the existence of multiple domains in the diodes as well as the results of our analysis."
"In order to reduce 1/f noise generated by Gunn diodes, an experimental study was made on the effects of thermocompression bonding on Gunn oscillator noise. It is found that carrier traps at dislocations introduced into the Gunn diode by the thermocompression process increase the Gunn oscillator noise significantly. An optimum thermocompression bonding condition for minimizing Gunn diode 1/f noise is described, taking into account such parameters as doping density and device area."
"The diode convolver performs signal processing, for example correlation, by mixing two input waveforms in an array of diodes, each diode being connected to a tap on a surface acoustic wave delay line. This paper gives the theory for the device efficiency, for a parallel circuit arrangement of taps and diodes. The effect of stray capacity is also analyzed. An experimental 31-tap device used hybrid circuitry in order to allow close spacing of the taps, giving a tap-to-tap propagation time of 90 ns. The efficiency agrees well with theory, showing that the bilinearity factor is maximized for an intermediate value of the bias current. The maximum bilinearity factor, relating external powers, was -34 dBm."
"The fabrication of ultra-thin silicon membranes of micron or submicron sizes with thicker supporting frames makes possible improvements in several kinds of electronic devices. We show that the series resistances of some devices can be reduced significantly, thus effecting increases in the cutoff frequencies. The resistance swing of Schottky diodes can also be raised. Initial experimentation relating to some of these applications is presented."
"The saturation velocity of electrons in n-GaAs has been deduced from the v/E characteristic over a temperature range 130-400 K. The experimental values are compared with those predicted by a model assuming the velocity to be limited by intervalley scattering in the (100) valleys. The agreement between theory and experiment is very good if a value of 0.42n10 is used for the effective mass in the (100) valleys."
"The need for fast-response low-voltage flame sensors, able to operate for long periods in ambients presenting a wide range of temperatures, prompted the construction and testing of gas amplification UV-photosensitive detectors utilizing 9741 glass envelopes and a variety of gas fills and electrode and getter materials. Addition of 1 mole percent H2to a He gas fill reduced the required minimum time between counts for a given sensor operating voltage without significantly changing the threshold voltage. All sensors with H2additive ultimately became solar sensitive. Sensors performed well at temperatures as high as 350°C."
"Calculations are presented which indicate that the barrier height of metal-thin insulator-p-silicon diodes can be greatly enhanced by the presence of positive charge in the interfacial layer. Application of the model to recent MIS silicon solar cell data suggests that oxide charge densities of 3-4 × 1012charges.cm-2could be responsible for the high performance of the reported cells."

 "The failure in 1945 of experiments proposed by Shockley, on what today would be called thin-film field-effect transistors, was a creative failure that stimulated Bardeen in early 1946 to propose that a surface-state shield blocked the field from the semiconductor's interior. Bell Laboratories' \"transistor group to be\" for the next eighteen months focused, not on practical, but on scientific aspects of the failure. Focus on the practical resumed (with a step-function increase, lasting several months, in \"the will to think\" about new concepts of semiconductor amplifiers, as measured by the rate of filling of laboratory notebook pages by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley) on 17 November 1947, when in his surface-state research, Brattain penetrated the shield by applying the field through an electrolyte. Within six days, patentable field-effect transistor inventions were conceived. Although useless as devices, these inventions were creative failures used by Bardeen and Brattain to discover the point-contact transistor three weeks later. Five weeks after this discovery, Shockley conceived the junction transistor while designing \"imref\" experiments on the point-contact transistor's inversion layer so that in 1951, the point-contact transistor in its turn became a creative failure when replaced by the junction transistor whose conception it had aided. But the path of thought to the conception of the junction transistor and the subsequent path to its practical realization are proven to be highly indirect by historical research on laboratory notebook entries. Specifically, Shockley's conception of the junction transistor was delayed by at least four months because he missed opportunities, obvious by hindsight, to recognize the possibility of minority carrier injection. The author hopes that the presentation of details of his limitations in making this important invention may help readers to accept their own limitations and, thereby, to become more persistent and, hence, creative."
              "A personalized account of the development of television pickup devices during the period 1930-1976 is related by a research worker active in the field since 1942. The story begins with the iconoscope and image dissector tubes and concludes with solid-state sensors of the CCD and CID variety. While the development is technical, the details have been minimized to provide a more comprehensive view."
 "Gas discharge displays (or plasma displays, as they are now frequently called) have evolved into two distinct forms. In dc displays, exciting electrodes are immersed in the gas, and currents are usually unidirectional. In ac displays, electrodes are separated from the gas by dielectrics. Contributions to both forms of display are discussed with particular emphasis on the conception and early history of the ac Display."

 "The limitations of conventional melt doping of phosphorus in silicon are discussed in relation to the obtainable homogeneity. Due to \"theoretical-design\" possibilities and increased manufacturing yield for power components based on n-type silicon, the method of thermal neutron irradiation doping has been developed for large scale production of floatzone silicon of homogeneous resistivity. It is shown that radioactivity problems do not interfere for resistivities above approximately 5Ω- cm and that lattice radiation defects can be annealed out to the extent that they appear harmless for all major applications. The doping homogeneity is discussed in view of the influencing nuclear reactor characteristics and the choice of starting material. Doping variations less than 1 percent across slices of up to 80-mm diameter are demonstrated to be obtainable with production results typically 3-10 percent. The minority carrier lifetime of neutron-doped silicon is shown to lie in the range of 100-1000 µs."
"Phosphorus doping of silicon with the aid of neutron irradiation is a very effective method to produce silicon single crystals with a homogeneous resistivity distribution and an exact average resistivity. The doping process is described and some aspects are given for the handling of the irradiated silicon. Experimental results concerning the resistivity distribution and the accuracy of aim are presented."
"Neutron irradiation is a way to produce homogeneous and well-defined phosphorus doping in large diameter silicon crystals. One major application of such silicon is in the field of high-voltage power devices. The relation between resistivity and breakdown voltage determined for neutron-irradiated silicon is in good agreement with the theory of Sze and Gibbons. It is shown that by changing from conventionally doped silicon to neutron-irradiated silicon noticeable increases in the blocking capability of thyristors can be achieved without an increase of the n-base width. Production of power thyristors with blocking voltages of 3 to 5 kV has been successful, indicating that applications of neutron-irradiated silicon have already left the laboratory stage."
"Very uniform phosphorus-doped high resistivity silicon suitable for power device research and production can be prepared using the thermal neutron activation of Si30to produce P31[1], [2], [4]. Some aspects of this process are described here, and it is shown that the method is also suitable for rapid production of silicon with precise resistivity tolerances in relatively small quantities for R and D purposes. Some of the considerable advantages to be gained by using this material for research purposes are described. Detailed studies of blocking characteristics and of the relationship between Au concentration, carrier lifetime, and resistivity using spreading resistance are shown to be possible, whereas using standard floating zone silicon, the resistivity fluctuations present are too large to allow this."
"Recombination centers introduced in silicon p+-n-n+structures by irradiation with 2-MeV electrons are studied by measuring minority carrier lifetime and annealing kinetics. The approximate location of these recombination centers in the forbidden gap and their densities are obtained by the thermally stimulated current method. The results identify one defect as a divacancy with an energy level of Ev+ 0.26 eV. Possible identities of other deep levels are discussed. The technique of minority carrier lifetime control by electron irradiation has been developed into a reliable manufacturing process for power devices."
"Planar isolation structures in power devices are produced in 10 min by the migration of patterned liquid alloy zones through silicon wafers in a temperature gradient. Relative to conventional all-diffused and mesa-structured power devices, this unique technique of thermomigration produces a high yield of devices with blocking characteristics closely approaching those predicted by theory."
"p-i-n structures have been made with avalanche blocking voltages between 1200 and 5100 V, using an Al-diffusion profile and a thick epitaxial film to obtain the buffering n-layer. The device areas are between 2.5 and 10 cm2. Epitaxial films of ∼50-µm thickness with a very low defect density have been obtained after an in situ gas phase etching with SF6of approximately 30 µm. The application of these p-i-n structures as a basic element for the development of very fast high voltage reverse non-blocking thyristors is briefly discussed."
"The n-p-n and p-n-p high-voltage transistors showing high reliabilities have been developed by using semi-insulating polycrystalline-silicon (SIPOS) films for the surface passivation. SIPOS films are chemically vapor-deposited polycrystalline-silicon doped with oxygen or nitrogen atoms. The films employed for the surface passivation of high-voltage transistors are composed of triple layers, which are oxygen-doped SIPOS films of 0.5-µm thickness to stabilize the silicon interface, nitrogen-doped SIPOS films of 0.15-µm thickness to prevent water or sodium ions from reaching the silicon surface, and silicon dioxide films to prevent dielectric breakdown of the SIPOS films under very high-voltage operation. The n-p-n and p-n-p SIPOS transistors rated at 800 and 2500 V have been produced in planar-like structures with field-limiting rings. These transistors showed highly reliable characteristics, because the passivating SIPOS layer provides a good protection against ionic contamination and externally applied electric fields. Furthermore, 10-kV n-p-n SIPOS transistors with multiple rings have been fabricated and found that operation is stable."
"The idealized concept of thermal resistance as applied to power transistors is discussed. This concept must be used with care because two of the basic assumptions made in applying the concept to these devices are not valid. Contrary to these assumptions, it is shown that 1) the junction temperature of a power transistor is never spatially uniform, and 2) no unique value of thermal resistance can be defined for all operating conditions. Also, various electrical methods for measuring the junction temperature (thermal resistance) of power transistors are discussed with the emphasis placed on the emitter-only switching measurement technique, which is the preferred standard method of measurement. In addition, the generation and meaning of forward-biased safe-operating-area (SOA) limits are discussed, and it is shown that because of the presence of current crowding and the associated hotspots, the specified SOA limits often permit devices to be operated at dangerously high junction temperatures. Electrical measurement methods capable of determining the peak junction temperature as well as determining the onset of current crowding are described, and it is shown how these methods might be used for the generation of improved SOA limits."
"X-ray section topographs contain much information about the position of defects inside single crystal slices of silicon. In this paper, the type of information which can be obtained without recourse to the complex dynamic diffraction theory is described. Some examples where section topographs have provided useful information concerning problems in development of power devices are given: bulk defects in silicon starting materials have been studied and shown to be a direct cause of premature electrical breakdown in high power devices. Other examples include determination of the depth of process-induced dislocations and revelation of copper decorated swirls on the crystal growth front."
"This paper discusses the reliability of soft soldered silicon power transistors under various thermal cycling conditions. A thermal cycling system is described which provides electrical testing and thermal impedance measurements of the devices until they fail. The thermal impedance measurement technique and the cycling parameters of the devices tested are discussed. Differences between computed and measured steady-state thermal resistance indicate interface problems associated with the fabrication of soft soldered devices. The study is focused on 2N3055 power transistors from a variety of manufacturers. It is shown that the thermal impedance is sensitive to changes in the Si-header joint and will increase upon cycling due to the thermal fatigue process. Information on mechanical failure of joints is obtained from scanning electron microscopy studies on the failed devices. The important parameters that affect the lifetime of the devices are indicated, and their effects are shown quantitatively. It is concluded that thermal impedance measurements can provide a reliable probing technique for imperfections in the soft soldered contacts found in many power devices."
"Second breakdown in power transistors continues to be an actively discussed subject. Although there is general agreement that the lateral thermal instability model adequately explains forward bias second breakdown, it fails to explain the reverse bias failure mechanism. The thermal initiation and electrical initiation processes have been successful in explaining only some aspects of this phenomena. This paper studies the subject of reverse bias second breakdown both experimentally and analytically. It is seen that there is excellent correlation between theory and experiment. The conclusion of this investigation is that avalanche injection is the triggering mechanism. Further, the filamentary currents that result from this can in most cases result in device failure. It is also concluded that under fixed circuit conditions, the reverse bias second breakdown potential of a transistor is completely specified by the single parameter Vpwhich is the voltage necessary for avalanche injection."
"In this paper the mechanisms of bandgap narrowing, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, Auger recombination, and carrier-carrier and carrier-lattice scattering are included in an exact one-dimensional model of a bipolar transistor. The transistor is used as a vehicle for studying the relative importance of each of these phenomena in determining emitter efficiency in devices with emitter junction depths of 1 µm to 8 µm. It is shown that bandgap narrowing is the dominant influence for devices with shallow emitters of 2 µm or less and that SRH recombination dominates for emitter depths greater than 4 µm. Calculations are also presented showing the effects of the emitter surface concentration and high-level injection on the current gain for devices with emitter junction depths of 1 µm to 8 µm. It is shown that there is an optimum surface concentration of 5 × 1019cm-3for the 1-µm emitter depth but no optimum under 1021cm-3for devices with emitter depths greater than 4 µm."
"Basic charge-control concepts are applied to the problem of predicting the static and large-signal switching characteristics of high-voltage transistors, with particular emphasis placed on the quasi-saturation region. Under the assumptions of unity base transport factor and one-dimensional current flow, simple equations for device electrical characteristics are derived in terms of readily determined device parameters. A two-region model is developed for predicting the turn-on process. Measured turn-on waveforms and collector characteristics are compared with the calculated behavior for a BVCE0= 400 V switching transistor. A comparison with hFE(Ic) data is also given for different temperatures. In all cases, good agreement with the predictions of the model is obtained. Implications of the model with respect to device design and characterization are discussed."
"A Model has been proposed and solved in which all Darlington circuits may be represented to a first order approximation by five constants, one of which may be normalized. Experimental verification has been provided offering excellent agreement with theory. Several orders of magnitude improvement in current-handling ability have been shown to exist for multistage Darlington circuits over conventional discrete transistors. The allocation of chip area for each stage is extensively discussed as a design aid."
"This paper deals with the design concepts of high energy punchthrough structures. The equations for the voltage-ampere V-I characteristics of the punchthrough diodes are first derived in terms of the base doping and the base width and the maximum power handling capability is then calculated by incorporating the boundary conditions for thermal instability. A set of design curves are generated for various base width and base doping levels. Several groups of punchthrough limited p+-n-p+devices with different voltage capabilities were fabricated. The power handling and the energy handling capabilities were directly measured and the results were compared with calculated values. These diodes were successfully used in an ignition circuit as a replacement for Zener diodes to clamp the collector-base voltage of the output transistor.The diodes showed energy handling capability as high as 19 J for pellet size of 0.17 in × 0.17 in."
"The fast switching thyristor with an integrated rectifier-diode connected in antiparallel to the cathode-emitter junction of auxiliary thyristor has been made. This thyristor has the ratings of blocking voltage 1200 V, average current 400 A. The turn-off time of less than 6 µs can be obtained by applying -10 V gate bias. It has the interdigitated gate structure and the high-frequency current rating more than 500 A at 10 kHz."
"A study of the turnoff physics in gate-assisted turnoff thyristors (GATT's) leads to a proposed mechanism involving the gate bias acting to prevent a forward voltage from appearing on the cathode rather than, as was previously thought, to sweep out excess carriers. It is shown that cathode shunting can be used in GATT's to virtually eliminate an important failure mode and to decrease the gate voltage needed to produce the desired improvement in turnoff time. Implications for designing GATT's are given, one being that a change in the lateral resistance of the p-base will have opposite effects depending on whether the cathode is shunted or not."
"The feasibility of directly light triggering a high power phase control thyristor is investigated. Work is described on an optically triggered gated 53-mm diameter 2600-V 1000-A thyristor which is similar to an electrically gated production version. Test results describing the response of this thyristor to various optical signals are presented. Our work has shown that this cell can be directly triggered by light at an equivalent gate current which is a factor of three below its present dynamic gate requirements and still largely retain all its blocking and dynamic characteristics. This improvement is obtained by the use of a second very sensitive amplifying gate stage which is responsive to light. All wafer processing of the light sensitive thyristor was carried out on standard production lines. Tests made on static dV/dt, di/dt, blocking voltage, and leakage current on light sensitive devices all closely match parameters of the standard electrically fired equivalent cell."
"Light activated power thyristors would have considerable advantages in intermediate- and high-voltage circuits, as power and trigger circuits could be electrically separated by use of glass fiber cables. Besides high-voltage capability, such devices must have turn-on delay times, dv/dt capabilities, and di/dt stabilities which are comparable to conventionally fired thyristors. The necessary trigger power, however, has to be kept low enough to enable firing with GaAs light emitters, which are available now or will be in the near future. The dv/dt sensitivity is an essential limitation for the reduction of the minimum necessary trigger power. Optimizing of the thyristor emitter shunts results in an already acceptable compromise, but much better results can be obtained by a gate structure which actively compensates dv/dt fault triggering. Our test devices show good turn-on behavior. A short survey on different GaAs-light sources and the coupling problem is given."
"The field terminated diode (FTD) is a new medium power switching element which meets the important criteria of a switching thyristor: fast switching and low conduction losses. Two types of devices are described, the FTD itself, which is used in commutated turn off applications, and a gate turn off variation of the FTD called the field controlled thyristor (FCT). These are three terminal devices, and forward blocking is achieved by applying a reverse bias to the grid with respect to the cathode; reverse blocking is accomplished at the anode junction. Both devices are described, and their performance is compared to that of transistors and conventional switching thyristors."
"The ohmic part of the gate-cathode characteristic of thyristors has been calculated numerically. Normal and amplifying gate structures as well as emitter shorts are included. By a simple extension of the model, the case of the dv/dt and breakover turn-on has also been treated. It is thus possible to calculate the minimal control current and voltage for a cathode side thyristor geometry and to optimize the device with respect to the turn-on process."
"This paper describes a new method of studying the influence of the gate-emitter geometrical configuration of thyristors upon their triggering performances. This method allows, for devices of any geometrical complexity, to calculate the emitter bias voltage distribution prior to turn-on and hence to compare the behavior of these devices from a geometrical point of view. The results may be used as guide lines for the optimum design of gate-emitter configurations. As examples, precise design rules are given for standard thyristors and application to amplifying interdigited gate thyristors are outlined."
"A technique is described that provides a basis for predicting whether any device design change will improve or degrade the unavoidable trade-off that must be made between the conduction loss and the turn-off speed of fast-switching high-power thyristors. The technique makes use of a previously reported method by which, for a given design, this trade-off was determined for a wide range of carrier lifetimes. It is shown that by extending this technique, one can predict how other design variables affect this trade-off. The results show that for relatively slow devices the design can be changed to decrease the current gains to improve the turn-off time without significantly degrading the losses. On the other hand, for devices having fast turn-off times design changes can be made to increase the current gain to decrease the losses without a proportionate increase in the turn-off time. Physical explanations for these results are proposed."
"A qualitative discussion of the turn-on delay phase of one-dimensional thyristors is given, taking into account the effect of the charge of the free carriers on the width of the space-charge region. It is shown that in a resistive load circuit the slope of the load current rise goes to infinity for finite values of a critical current density. Along a simple quasi-stationary model the influence of varying voltage, n-base doping, n-base width, and gate current on the load current rise and on the critical current density is discussed quantitatively."
"In order to check the results derived in Part I, we investigated under constant voltage conditions the turn-on of thyristors that showed during the turn-on delay phase a close to one-dimensional behavior when operated with small gate currents. We investigated the dependence of the current rise on the gate current, on the n-base doping and its width, and on the applied voltage. For those thyristors that had technical design parameters with respect to the width and the doping of the n-base, the experimental rise curves could be fitted to a good approximation with theoretical curves derived from the simple quantitative model in Part I."
"The first dynamic phase is characterized by a rapid voltage decay during which electron transport by field effects inside the space-charge layer (SCL) in the base region of an n-base thyristor are supposed to dominate. If the external circuit does not impose a voltage-current dependence, a simple one-dimensional model can be formulated which is based on mobile charges affecting the SCL. Comparison with electrical data about turn-on yields approximate information concerning the effective area of the initially conducting channel which is in good agreement with infrared observation. In conjunction with this model, the electrical measurements lead to a simple method to detect failure of a thyristor to turn on homogeneously."
"A closed form solution for the forward characteristics of a very asymmetrical step-junction p-i-n diode at high current levels is derived and discussed. It is found that the forward voltage decreases significantly when the amount of the impurities per unit area of one of the highly doped regions is reduced. The theory is confirmed by experiment, and the diodes obtained show a low forward loss together with high reverse blocking voltage and fast reverse recovery."
"It is shown that high avalanche breakdown voltage in both plane and planar p-n junctions can be achieved by extending the heavily doped side of the junction beyond the contact and partially etching into it. This forces the depletion region to spread back some distance in the heavily doped side. The technique, when properly applied, is capable of giving virtually ideal breakdown voltages for both plane and planar type p-n junctions and uses only a fraction of the area required for a typical negative bevel. The actual breakdown voltage depends on how carefully the etch is controlled. For planar junctions, the breakdown voltages that can now be achieved are better than any previously reported. Moreover, since the technique is based on etching, mechanical contouring is avoided. This, in itself, is beneficial. Both the new method, termed the depletion etch method (DEM), and the negative bevel technique are discussed using a simple theory of charge balancing which appears to simplify qualitative comparison of different geometries used to increase avalanche breakdown voltage. From this theory, it is easy to see why the new method is potentially superior in terms of peak surface to peak bulk field trade-off. Exact numerical three-dimensional (with radial symmetry) electric field calculations as well as a number of experimental results using both plane and planar junctions bear out the predictions of the simple theory. Moreover, both the calculations and the experiments performed to date show that close to the ideal p-n junction, breakdown voltage can be reached for both plane and planar type p-n junctions if the etch depth can be controlled with sufficient precision."
"In this paper, the concept of an effective negative bevel angle is introduced. It is shown that the fraction of the ideal breakdown voltage that is attained for virtually any negatively bevelled diffused junction device is a single function of this effective bevel angle. These results can be used to calculate the breakdown voltage for diffused junction devices over the range of commonly used negative bevels. The effective bevel angle is shown to be the product of the actual bevel angle and the square of the ratio of the depletion width on the lightly and heavily doped sides of the junction for the ideal device at breakdown. Consideration is also given to abrupt junction devices. In the final section, an approximate means for correcting these results for variations in the passivant dielectric constant and the introduction of surface charge is presented."
"A new technique of bonding copper directly to ceramic, employing the copper-copper oxide eutectic melt, is described. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and EDAX are used to study the details of this bond. A specific utilization of these techniques is portrayed in a 2-SCR-3-diode controlled bridge. This bridge is used as a 2-hp dc motor speed control. The advantages of using these techniques over previous methods (thick film or moly-manganese) lie in the ability to bond almost any thickness of high-conductivity copper to ceramics (Al2O3, BeO, BN, ZnO, etc.) silica, dissimilar metals, or to copper itself. Incidental benefits, described in the report, include bonding copper lead frames instead of screen printing, lack of high thermal and electrical resistivity interface layers, and simplicity of manufacture. Ceramic properties found to influence bond quality were: 1) Topology in terms of a fractured surface due to lapping and/or die sticking. 2) Degree of intergranular bond strength. 3) Cleanliness of surface and degree of unbonded particulate matter (powder) on the surface. 4) Grain size. The bonding agent is characterized as a field of bonded Cu2O nodules precipitated from the Cu-Cu2O eutectic melt with a density much higher than expected from the 4.7-percent Cu2O (by volume) contained in the eutectic mixture. Mechanisms to explain this behavior are described. The bond strength is noted to depend on the nodule density and the bond strength of the Cu2O to copper and is higher than any other bonding method."
"A small planar four-probe test structure for measuring the bulk or collector resistivity of silicon wafers was designed and fabricated with a bipolar transistor process. Analogous to a mechanical square array four-point probe, the planar four-probe structure consists of a large-area base diffusion which is broken at four points through which contact is made to the undiffused collector material. A probe spacing of 2.25 mil (57.2 µm) allows the resistivity of the silicon wafer to be measured with good spatial resolution. A correction factor was derived to obtain the true resistivity from measurements on a wafer with finite thickness and a conducting backside, and it is presented along with the correction factors for other cases. The test device was fabricated in silicon wafers whose resistivities ranged from 0.013 Ω. cm to 12 Ω. cm in n-type material and from 0.7 Ω. cm to 30 Ω. cm in p-type material. Planar four-probe resistivity values are compared with mechanical four-probe values taken on the same wafers before fabrication, and the results are generally in agreement within ±3 percent."
"This paper is concerned with the question whether the relatively small resistivity variations present in starting silicon can be measured with the spreading resistance method of Mazur and Dickey with an accuracy that is satisfactory for a characterization of the material. Comparative measurements will be reported on that were performed on silicon slices with this conventional method on the one hand and with a method to measure spreading resistance using nonblocking aluminum-silicon contacts on the other hand. The conventional spreading resistance measurements were taken in eight different laboratories."
"The paper is a report of experimental results on a correlation between the switch delay of a forvistor and the delay control current. Variations in the delay time versus the device temperature and minor section current are studied."
"When a square-wave current flows through a thyristor, time variations of two-dimensional temperature rise distribution in the thyristor are calculated using a finite-difference method and the on-region of the n-base layer, which was measured by a microwave technique. The calculated result approximately agrees with the temperature rise distribution measured using an infrared microscope. It is shown that the position where temperature rise is highest moves away from the initial turn-on area with time."
"The results of an application of an epitaxial technique of low-concentration (<1 × 1014atoms/cm3) impurity doping control to high-voltage power transistors (BVCB0= 1200 V, Ic= 2.5 A) are described. An n-epitaxial layer of about 1 × 1015atoms/cm3concentration and about 25-µm thickness and ν-epitaxial layer of 5-8 × 1013atoms/cm3concentration and 155-165- µm thickness are successively grown on the n+-substrates to form the collector region. The p-base and n+-emitter regions are formed by diffusion. It is shown that the transistors fabricated have a collector-base breakdown voltage (BVCB0) of 1400-2300 V and other reasonable electrical characteristics."

"This paper describes the results of an investigation of hole currents in the thin-oxide metal-silicon nitride-silicon dioxide-silicon (MNOS) varactor structure. Deviations from the predictions of Poole-Frenkel theory were noted. The results were analyzed using the calculations of Murgatroyd for space-charge-limited (SCL) flow, suitably modified to account for a threshold of SCL current due to the oxide potential barrier. The result is shown to agree with experiment over approximately six decades of current while traditional space-charge-free Poole-Frenkel theory does not."
"Part I of this investigation involves theoretical and experimental characterization of the noise performance of modern silicon planar bipolar junction transistors (BJT's) above the 1/f noise frequency region in a temperature range of 60-300 K and for several difference bias conditions. At temperatures below approximately 110 K, an excess noise source as measured by the equivalent noise resistance RN, referred to the input of the device, common-base configuration, is revealed. This excess source, resulting from a generation-recombination process within the base region of the device, is shown to have a linear dependence on the base current and base resistance as KIB2rb'b2, and an exponential dependence on temperature."
"In Part II of this investigation, a characterization of the output noise current generator i0of modern planar bipolar junction transistors (BJT's) for common-base configuration with the input ac open circuited is developed and verified at temperatures ranging from 60 to 300 K. It is shown that at low temperatures, for those devices where recombination processes in the emitter-base space-charge region become very pronounced, the resulting noise for these processes shows less than full shot noise. This noise reduction can show up at temperatures slightly below room temperature for such devices. (Generation-recombination effects described in Part I may still become important at temperatures below 110 K.) Also, it is demonstrated that an important parameter to monitor in taking these measurements, at least at low temperatures, is the alpha cutoff frequency fα if the low-frequency theory is to be realized."
"The evolution of a generalized time-dependent cathode boundary field model is discussed, and calculations are presented which demonstrate its applicability for explaining such diverse phenomena as 1) the appearance of anomalously high efficiency oscillations in InP and 2) the more moderate oscillatory behavior associated with GaAs."
"A theoretical investigation of the avalanche breakdown characteristics of punchthrough diodes is carried out and a comparison made with the nonpunchthrough diodes. It is shown that the former have harder breakdown characteristics and a sharper knee for a given breakdown voltage. In addition, punchthrough diodes have a lower temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage, a lower space-charge resistance, a negligible sensitivity of breakdown voltage to resistivity striations in single crystal wafers, and breakdown due to avalanche mechanism up to lower breakdown voltages. Though these positive features suggest that punchthrough diodes are superior in performance to nonpunchthrough diodes for applications such as voltage regulators etc., the final assessment will depend on a more critical evaluation of the reliability against burn out and instability."
"As an approach to an advanced LSI logic, a high-speed and low-power femto-joule logic circuit has been developed by using an enhancement-type Schottky barrier gate FET (ESBT) with31P implanted channel layer. A direct coupled transistor logic (DCTL) was designed using ESBT and resistor as a basic logic circuit. To evaluate the dynamic performance of the logic circuit, a 15-stage ring oscillator with an output buffer was integrated on a chip. A power-delay product was found in the femto-joule range. The logic swing is about 0.4 V and typical noise margin is 30 percent of the logic swing. A high-speed (40 ns) and low-power (10 mW) 4 bit ALU has been developed by using DCTL, NOR gates. Furthermore, improving ESBT channel layer carrier profile to the higher carrier concentration and abruptly changing shallower carrier profile by31P and11B double implantation resulted in advanced characteristics of ESBT and logic circuit using it as follows. ESBT transconductance was increased by a factor of two. Power-delay product reduced to 80 percent of that of logic circuit, using ESBT with31P single implanted channel layer, was satisfactorily confirmed, together with a circuit density as large as 300 gates/ mm2."
"Bistable switching in supercritically doped n+-n-n+GaAs transferred electron devices (TED's) is investigated experimentally and interpreted in computer simulations, for which details of the computer program are given. Three switching modes all leading to stable anode domains are discussed, namely: 1) cathode-triggered traveling domain; 2) cathode-triggered accumulation layer; 3) anode-triggered domain. Relative current drops up to 40 percent, and switching times down to 60 ps are obtained in low-duty-cycle pulsed experiments with threshold currents around 400 mA. Optimum device parameters are shown to be as follows: 1) doping in the 3-4 × 1015cm-3range; 2) length around 6 µm; 3) doping gradients below 20 percent; 4) high-quality interfaces."
"New two-terminal nonvolatile memory cells are proposed, in which an n-channel MNOS transistor is functionally integrated with a p-channel MNOS or MOS transistor. The operational principle of both types of the cells is substantially based on the Λ (lambda)-shaped I-V Characteristic of complementary FET's. The most valuable feature of the new cells is the unipolar pulse operation of the simple diode-matrix array which can be used in a RAM mode by the use of selective writing and erasing as well as in an electrically alterable PROM mode."
"Results of a two-dimensional finite-element simulation of a GaAs MESFET are presented. The simulation is used to determine the drain current and transconductance as well as the two-dimensional voltage, electron density, and electric-field distributions. It is shown that placement of a compensated doping region in the high electric-field region between gate and drain increases the drain current and transconductance by reducing the velocity-saturation effect. The transconductance and drain conductance of the MESFET in the saturation region of devices having different channel heights are compared with previous analysis."
"An analysis of the Schottky-barrier gate transferred electron logic devices (TELD's) is developed which gives the trigger sensitivity in terms of the channel pinchoff voltage, normalized channel depletion width under the gate, device subthreshold transconductance, and the value of the external load resistor. The results presented show that the trigger sensitivity increases with increase in doping density, decrease in channel pinchoff voltage, and decrease in gate reverse bias. Furthermore, for the same material parameters (doping density, channel thickness, etc.) device subthreshold transconductance (gm) improves the trigger sensitivity by a factor (1 + gmRL). Device designs based on this analysis should result in improved device performance."
"In this paper we present a new acoustic surface wave phase-locked loop FM demodulator. This device uses the nonlinear coupling characteristics of an insulating piezoelectric to an adjacent semiconductor to generate an electric field in the semiconductor. The low-frequency voltage resulting from the spatial integration of the electric field along the semiconductor is used as the controlling voltage of a voltage controlled oscillator. The above device acts as a phase-locked loop of either the first order or the second order, depending on the amplitude of the input waves, the characteristics of the coupling device, and the integration length of the electric field in the semiconductor. Both theoretical and experimental results relating to the lock range, frequency tracking, and FM demodulation characteristics of the novel device are described."
"The plasma panel is a 2-level type of display possessing local memory, high luminance, and selective write-erase capability. There are, however, no convenient inexpensive methods for interacting graphically with material displayed on a panel by means of a hand-held stylus. A simple and potentially low-cost technique has been developed in which a light pen can be used to point at any part, dark or light, of a plasma panel, thus making an economical interactive plasma-display system possible. The technique is based on the ability to selectively address one cell of the panel with a sequence of two interrogating pulses. Therefore, depending on the state of the addressed cell, one or the other interrogating pulse will cause the addressed cell to flash at a time different from all other cells, without altering the state of the addressed cell or disturbing the unselected cells. The light pen is gated to look for these light pulses and their individual Phase in order to establish the location of the light pen and the state of the cell. The operating margins for the interrogating pulses exceed the panel's own write-erase margins, and the additional hardware required beyond the normal panel sustain and select circuitry is negligible."
"This paper presents an influence of the electric field dependence of the diffusion coefficient of electrons (D(E) relation) on a formation of a stable domain at an anode contact in a transferred electron device. The stable domain (anode trapped domain) has been observed in a planar Gunn device experimentally, and it has been shown that a large trigger voltage is needed to launch a new domain if a preceding domain has been trapped. Computer simulations have been carried out in order to find a condition to form the trapped domain. Various D(E) relations of GaAs presented by many authors have been adopted to the simulation, and it is shown that one of these D(E) relations is suitable to describe the dynamic behaviors of electrons in GaAs. Simulated results have indicated that the trapped domain occurs in a certain range of doping density."
"The effect of stationary charges trapped in the region near the p-n boundary and in the edge region of a semiconductor junction space-charge layer on the evaluation of the concentration profiles of the recombination centers as well as doping impurities, from high-frequency capacitance transient data, is studied. Both the theory, its simplification for junctions with low concentration of recombination centers, and two experimental examples are given to illustrate the importance of the edge effect. One of the examples is an aluminum on n-Si Schottky diode with a very low concentration of process-induced donor trap, and the other is a phosphorus and gold diffused diode with a gold concentration about 20 percent of the boron concentration."
"The noise and signal properties of Read-type avalanche diodes under large-signal levels are examined. In contrast to most other previous theories, we include the saturation current in the equations rigorously from the beginning. We find that the noise performance is a strong function of the saturation current such that high saturation currents lead to lower noise performance. We compare the findings of our model with measurements on two very different Read-type avalanche diodes with a low-high-low profile. In agreement with theory, the lower noise diode has a higher saturation current. We also find experimentally that the noise measure of the diodes used as oscillators decreases with increasing power output. This feature is explained by the rising reverse saturation current with temperature which in some diodes more than compensates the normally increasing noise measure with power output."
"The noise measures of both GaAs and InP transferred electron amplifiers (TEA's) are calculated by a small-signal computer simulation for devices having a range of realistic doping profiles, some of which are designed specifically to limit the amount of free charge injected into the structure. Optimum values of average electric-field strength and carrier concentration times length product for minimum noise are shown to exist. The computed results differ not too greatly from those predicted by a simple analytical model where a uniform free carrier concentration and dc electric field are assumed. The lowest noise measures predicted are 7 dB for GaAs and 4 dB for InP if charge injection is suitably constrained. The computed results are compared with results reported in the literature."
"The accuracy of the Boltzmann relation for the derivation of p-n junction forward characteristics is examined by relatively simple analysis, when recombinations in the depletion layer are negligible. The Boltzmann relation for carrier densities is found to be applicable in wide-base diodes, but in thin-base diodes and transistors, carrier densities can be smaller than those calculated with the Boltzmann relation."
"A closed form expression for the redistribution of ion-implanted impurities in silicon during diffusion in an oxidizing ambient is derived, based on a theoretical model proposed by Huang and Welliver. It is shown that the computed results for boron profiles agree very well with experimental data. The closed form solution requires considerably less computer execution time than the usual numerical solution."

"Under certain environmental conditions, electrostatic discharges can cause catastrophic failure in both bipolar and FET integrated circuits [1]. Some devices (MOSFET's) are particularly susceptible to damage because of the relatively low destructive breakdown voltage (50 to 100 V) of their thin oxides. One source of concern is discharges from the human body during handling. This problem can be minimized by taking various approaches, such as 1) manufacturing the device so it has a high oxide breakdown voltage, 2) adding a protective device to the input, 3) developing special handling procedures to prevent high voltages from being applied to the devices accidentally. The objectives of this paper are to present a technique to test the effectiveness of FET protective devices using a simulated human static discharge and also to present a mathematical model that can predict a catastrophic failure as a function of voltage developed across the FET device and the energy dissipated. Both theoretical and experimental data are presented."
"An n-p-n-type bipolar transistor with an emitter region formed by a new ion implantation predeposition diffusion exhibits much less leakage current compared to that formed by a conventional process. This new emitter region has a thermal history of first anneal at 500°C, second anneal at 900°C, and third anneal at 1050°C after phosphorus implantation predeposition of 1 × 1016/cm2at 50 keV."
"A flat matrix-array cathode-ray tube that has the potential of producing very bright displays is described. This tube combines electron beams and thin-film transistors within one vacuum envelope. Construction and performance of a demonstration device is discussed."
 "A TRAPATT diode has been fabricated using a variation of silicon planar technology. Its design combines the advantages of the surface stability of the planar process with low parasitic capacitance usually associated only with mesa devices. Since shallow diffusions may be used, the device retains an excellent heat-dissipation capability."
"A transient solution of the ionization coefficient for electrons (α) in silicon has been obtained for various electric field strengths. The results show that α takes a longer time to come to its steady-state value for lower electric field strengths. The time the transient lasts is of the order of 10-13s."
"A process technology is described which incorporates ion implantation for the fabrication of CMOS/SOS silicon-gate integrated circuits.

"The role of thermally assisted tunneling in highly doped anisotype heterojunctions is investigated by a method involving the measurement of temperature dependence of ideality factor β when this is significantly different from unity. First of all a straightforward computational method for obtaining theoretical β in GaAs is quoted and compared with similar values obtained by other means. Then the validity of the results its shown experimentally through a systematic comparison with Au-n GaAs Schottky diodes with majority charge carrier density in the range 1018-1019cm-3. Agreement is generally good, although a systematic ratio of about 1.2 between carrier density Nd, the only disposable constant in the theory, and that calculated from Hall values has to be accounted for by assuming this to represent the neglected scattering factor in the latter, although uncertainty in the best average effective mass to use also contributes. Finally, the theory is applied to anisotype heterojunctions, all on p+-GaAs substrates, and a variety of degrees of agreement noted. Quantitative agreement is found for specially prepared abrupt n(GaIn)As-p GaAs heterojunctions, confirming the predominance of thermally assisted tunneling of this type of substantially doped anisotype device."
"The Green-Shewchun method of solution is applied to the transmission line circuit model of Sah to obtain the forward current-, capacitance-, and conductance-voltage characteristics of semiconductor p-n junctions. Numerical solutions are obtained for diffused dopant impurity profiles and several position dependent concentration profiles of gold recombination centers to illustrate the variation of the reciprocal slope parameter m in the dc current, exp (qV/mkT). A new behavior of m = 2 is observed for many decades of current in the low-level range when the recombination centers are concentrated at the edge of the space-charge layer as expected from ion implantation. The theoretical calculations are compared with experimental forward current-, conductance-, and capacitance-voltage data from 10 to 106Hz and 77 to 300 K. Excellent agreements are obtained without adjustable parameters for boron and gold diffused p+-n silicon diodes from low to high injection levels. A twenty-five fold increase of the steady-state hole lifetime from low to high injection level is both observed and predicted. Agreements are also obtained for phosphorus- and gold-diffused n+-p silicon diodes from low to intermediate injection levels where the steady-state electron lifetime is nearly constant and controlled by electron capture into the positively charged gold donor centers."
"In this work we examine the response of minority carriers in metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitors to small-amplitude step excitation for times sufficiently short to preclude the attainment of equilibrium. The analysis, carried out in the depletion and weak inversion regimes, is shown to be consistent with previously described phenomenological arguments regarding the response in heavy inversion. In addition, the present analysis takes into account changes in minority carrier population produced by surface-state generation or other phenomena. The results are used to describe the response of the surface minority-carrier density to square-wave excitation in a surface-state-free structure."
"A charge-control model of the pin diode is developed which fully accounts for the additional contact-layer storage charges. This part of the storage charge is shown to greatly influence both the forward steady state and the turn-off transient (switching time and transition-loss). Needing limited mathematical efforts, the model seems well suited for analysis of complicated microwave networks with pin diodes, such as phase shifters, limiters, and frequency converters. As is demonstrated by numerical results, an optimal i-layer width may exist for certain applications."
"The SEM has been used as a voltage measuring probe to obtain voltage distributions in X-band n+-n-n+mesa structure Gunn devices. Dynamic distributions are obtained by operating the instrument in the stroboscopic mode. The results show accumulation layers in the oscillating device and the amplifier mode has a high field anode region."
"The probability that a trigger pulse will successfully allow a driver circuit to discharge its energy through a xenon flashlamp is discussed. Based on a classical description of trigger spark formation and propagation statistics, the misflash probability, Pm, is described in terms of the ionization rate in the flash-lamp, β; the trigger pulsewidth, te; and the normalized trigger pulse overvoltage (Vs- Vst)/Vdc. This model was experimentally validated for series and parallel trigger circuits over a broad range of trigger pulse voltages, Vs, and pulseforming network voltages, VB."
"The theoretical dependence of the small-signal impedance of microwave punchthrough diodes (BARITT) on the shape of the velocity-field characteristic is studied with the aid of a small-signal computer simulation and a simple analytical model, in an attempt to assess what semiconductor material might give the smallest negative Q factor. Four different types of velocity-field characteristics are considered showing, respectively, soft saturation (e.g., holes in Si), negative mobility (e.g., electrons in GaAs), constant mobility (e.g., electrons in GaP), and hard saturation (e.g., electrons in GaAs1-xPx). A clear picture emerges of the effect of the velocity-field characteristics on the microwave negative resistance with Si appearing to be the near optimum material; GaAs provides little if any negative resistance due to poor phasing of the injected ac space charge and the other two materials are intermediate."
"The voltage and angular dependence of the electro-optic transfer characteristic of a twisted-nematic display are strongly affected by the average orientation (tilt bias) of the liquid-crystal molecules at the solid surfaces enclosing the fluid. A cell made with low tilt bias of the liquid-crystal molecules has a much sharper threshold in its electro-optic transfer curve and much better viewability when operated in a multiplexed mode than a display with a high tilt bias of the liquid-crystal molecules. As an example, a four-digit multiplexed twisted-nematic display of low tilt bias is viewable over a solid angle of about II/2 sr; whereas a high tilt-bias twisted-nematic device operating under the same multiplexing conditions is only viewable over a solid angle of about 0.50 sr."
"A bright green luminescence at 5250 Å is reported for cathodochromic sodalite powders under ultraviolet excitation. This emission is observed in germanium-doped sodalite samples in which the halogen ion is either Cl, Br, or I and under certain conditions in germanium-free bromine sodalite. These powders constitute a new class of materials which allow the construction of cathodochromic CRT's whose images can be viewed in either high or low ambient light."
"An investigation was made of the effects of aging on diodes based on 60° dislocations. The electrical properties of the dislocation p-n junctions showed good stability and were unaffected by the Cottrell impurity atmosphere. This property suggests that there are practical uses for semiconductor devices based on the principle of dislocations. A proposed assembly of the diode based on a single 60° dislocation is described."
"High-speed high-radiance luminescent diodes for optical transmission systems have been fabricated. Proton bombardment is used for confining the area of the active region. Modulation cutoff frequencies of 170 MHz and a radiance of 11 W/ sr. cm2at a diode current of 100 mA have been measured."
"Ion implantation has been used to increase the depletion-layer capacitance beneath the inversion layer of an MOS capacitor in order to enhance the charge storage per unit area. Boron and arsenic implants were used to increase the depletion-layer capacitance, approximately halving the area required for a given charge storage."
"The probability density function for the gain of an avalanche photodiode is derived. The derivation is based on a Lagrange expansion of the implicit form of the moment generating function. The results confirm previously published conjectures."
"A MOSFET of novel structure is proposed, which has a potential advantage on its switching speed. The new structure is similar to that of SOS-MOS which essentially eliminates the junction capacitance of the MOSFET. This structure is fabricated by simultaneous deposition of single and polycrystalline silicon over silicon with selective oxidations already in place. The fabrication process and dc characteristics of the new devices are described. The speed-power characteristics are also evaluated by computer simulations."
"Methods of experimentally determining the surface-state density from MOS C-V measurements have been developed under the assumption that the density is approximately constant over the range of several kT about the Fermi level at the surface. This note illustrates that the surface-state density can actually vary quite rapidly in that range (as a result of a large first derivative) with no loss of accuracy."
"The optimization of the I2L speed-power product requires a clear understanding of the physical mechanisms that control device performance. Test structures have been designed and fabricated to characterize both intrinsic and extrinsic elements of an I2L gate. The electrical properties of the intrinsic n-p-n transistor are compared to calculations. Good agreement between measured and calculated beta is obtained for both the up and down transistor without parametric fitting. Band shrinkage, degeneracy, and Auger recombination are found to be important factors in determining the n-p-n base current. Intrinsic up betas greater than 2000 have been measured. The importance of n-p-n beta on the unit cell effective beta and the gate switching time is discussed."
"Closed form expressions are derived for the temperature of multimesa diodes arranged as trimesas, pentamesas, or N × N arrays."
 "High-efficiency silicon solar cells have been reported that use a surface alteration to reduce reflection. The process here reported purposely alters the cell surface with an anistropic etching in ternary mixtures of KOH, H2O, and ethyl glycol. Wafers were \"sensitized\" with a carbon compound to insure etching uniformity. It is suggested that the organic compound creates SiC nucleation sites, which in turn facilitates the formation of a tetrahedral structure on the cell surface. This structure promotes multiple interaction of the light beam between millions of pyramids per square centimeter on the surface. The surface geometry increases the light absorption and reduces reflectivity, thus increasing the cell efficiency."

"Silicon photodiodes and photo-FET's with high blue and UV sensitivity have been produced by a special boron diffusion process. Diodes with a junction depth around 0.2 µm exhibit a responsivity of 0.1 A/W at 253 nm; the maximum responsivity (with a quantum efficiency close to 100 percent) is reached at 440 nm. The responsivity of the photo-FET's operating in the photoconductive mode (VGS= 0) exceeds 103A/W at 350 nm. The spectral response curve and the large-signal behavior of the photo-FET's are strongly dependent on the operating conditions."
"The aim of the present paper is to show the possibility of designing high-power semiconductor switches the turn-on time of which is as short as that of hydrogen thyratrons. These devices switch pulses of 105W with turn-on times in the nanosecond range. In the OFF state all the voltage applied to a semiconductor switch is concentrated on the space-charge region (SCR) where there are assumed to be no free carriers. The process of switching into the ON state in a conventional thyristor switching mechanism is to fill the SCR with free electrons and holes injected from emitters by diffusion through base regions. The generation of carriers due to impact ionization in the SCR during the whole transition process accelerates switching. The avalanche injection (AI) suggested by Gunn [1] in diodes is the process providing impact ionization despite the voltage decrease in the device during its switching. At first we consider simplified AI processes and their potentialities in three-layer structures. Then the results are extended to more complex four- and five-layer structures by including the gate current. At the end the experimental data are given."
"From the measurement of the ion-induced secondary electron emission yield γiit was shown that with increasing γiof the dielectric panel material the firing voltage of an ac gas discharge display panel decreased. The measurement of the energy distributflon of the secondary electrons showed that the dielectric material with higher γihas lower most-probable energy (MPE), and half-width (HW) values. The energy distribution introduced by Stolz in the ease of secondary electrons emitted from a metal was applied to the dielectric panel material and solved by using a computer. From this result, it was shown that the lower the electron affinity of the dielectric panel material, the higher is the γi. Under the condition when γibecame greater than unity, unstable self-sustained emission was observed even though the primary ion beam was cut off."
"Detailed measurements have been made of the base and collector-current characteristics of both n-p-n and p-n-p silicon transistors as a function of temperature. The collector current shows ideal behavior over the temperature range -60 to 150°C in thatI_{C} \\infin \\exp (eV_{BE}/kT). On the other hand, the base current is nonideal:I_{B} \\infin \\exp (eV_{BE}/nkT), wheren > 1.0. The nonideality of IBis the main source of the temperature dependence ofh_{FE} = I_{C}/I_{B}. There is no evidence for bandgap narrowing in the devices we have investigated. The temperature dependence of the collector current is given byI_{C} \\infin T_{m} \\exp (-e E_{g0}/kT) \\exp (eV_{BE}/kT), wherem = 1.4or 1.7 for n-p-n or p-n-p devices, respectively.E_{g0} = 1.19 \\pm 0.01eV. This result is consistent with the findings of others. The base current is a complicated function of temperature due to the presence of nonideal components."
"Large-area backside illuminated charge-coupled device imagers have been fabricated using double level aluminum transfer electrode technology. Devices with 100 × 160 and 400 × 400 resolution elements have been fabricated using buried channel technology for high charge transfer efficiency. Detailed optical characterization has been performed on these imagers over the temperature range -40 to +24°C and at several operating frequencies between 10 kHz and 1 MHz."
"Measurements of the threshold voltage shift of MOS transistors in dependence on the implantation energy are correlated with calculations of the number of ions implanted in a small Si-layer beneath the gate oxide. The thickness of this layer and the number of deep levels per implanted ion is determined. The energy level ETof the implanted35Cl+in the silicon is approximately 0.85 eV below the conduction band."
"A collective transport-noise theory is given for the effects caused by generation-recombination current via traps in the space-charge region of a p-n junction. Langevin noise sources are added to the standard kinetic equations, which are subsequently solved for the current noise. No hypotheses are made on the coupling of the g-r current to the external circuit. In particular, Ramo's theorem does not apply, though similar transport factors emerge automatically as a consequence of the inclusion of displacement current. With the assumption that the free carrier transit times are very short, exact agreement with Lauritzen's [3] previous results, based on a probabilistic approach, is found. In addition, the admittance is computed from the same equations and is shown to be frequency dependent, contrary to standard assumptions made for the computation of emitter efficiency. Consistency with Nyquist's theorem is obtained for the low and high frequency regime. The noise reduction factors for forward biased junctions are discussed."

 "The operation and characteristics of the indium-doped infrared sensing MOSFET(IRFET) in the 2.0- to 7.0-µm wavelength range are described. Responsivities of 4.8 mA/µJ are easily achieved using relatively large devices with small W/L ratios. Determination of the thermal emission rate of the indium center in silicon indicates that operating temperatures of lower than 50 K are required. Application considerations in large-scale integrated infrared imaging arrays are discussed. The measurement of the thermal emission rate and photoionization cross section of indium also demonstrates the capability of the MOSFET device structure in characterizing shallower level impurity centers in silicon."
"Both platinum and gold have been used to reduce lifetimes in fast recovery silicon power devices. There are substantial differences between the energy levels introduced by these impurities. Both impurities introduce acceptor levels which act to reduce hole lifetimes in n-type silicon; however, the gold acceptor is much deeper (Ec- 0.54 eV) than the corresponding platinum acceptor (Ec- 0.26 eV). In p-type material, on the other hand, the two impurities are quite similar; gold introduces a donor at Ev+ 0.35 eV, while the platinum donor is at Ev+ 0.32 eV. In terms of basic physics, this paper establishes guidelines to determine, for a given device type, which lifetime killer should be used to provide optimal performance. Platinum offers improved high-temperature properties and turn-on performance when compared to gold and is a better selection for devices which are switched so rapidly that the turn-off is governed mainly by the high injection lifetime. However, when the switching wave form involves low injection recombination tails, gold is a better choice than platinum."
"Stability criteria of GaAs junction-gate FET's are studied by two-dimensional numerical analysis. The analysis covers the wide range of device geometry from the state of the art FET to the so-called Gunn effect digital devices. It is found that a GaAs FET exhibits either of the following three types of characteristics depending upon device geometry and doping concentration. First, for a thin channel with high doping concentration, the device tends to behave as a normal junction-gate FET with saturating current-voltage characteristics. This is even true when the n-l (device length) and n.d (device thickness) products exceed the previously accepted criteria for Gunn oscillation. Second, a stable negative resistance (SNR) is observed in devices with a moderate channel thickness. Third, for a thick channel, the device exhibits a Gunn oscillation with the domain propagating from the gate edge to the drain. These three categories of behavior are mapped on the nd plane with the help of simple analytic considerations. The map is found to compare well with experimental results."
"The design of high-frequency bipolar transistors with very low distortion is described. Simple expressions for distortion are used to select device parameters for the optimization of distortion performance. The effect of epitaxial-layer characteristics on device performance is considered in detail, and the importance of collector depletion in achieving low distortion is shown. The influence of device geometry on distortion is considered, and the degradation caused by MOS capacitance is illustrated."
"The results of a dynamic analysis of electron transport in GaAs and InP have been used to determine the effects of device cooling, channel length, and frequency of operation on the noise performance of FET's made of these materials. Noise temperature of the material as a function of electric field is first obtained by an analysis that models intervalley scattering using a Monte Carlo calculation method. Noise figure of the intrinsic device is then obtained using a gradual-channel analysis. The validity of such an analysis is discussed. Both GaAs and InP FET's should exhibit very good low-noise performance, with the intrinsic InP device somewhat noisier than the GaAs device at equivalent values of f/fT. For GaAs the intrinsic noise figure can be considerably reduced as the device is cooled, but for InP, cooling from 300 to 77 K should leave intrinsic noise figure almost unchanged."
"The current crowding due to the temperature dependence of avalanche breakdown is analyzed for the steady-state operation of an IMPATT diode mounted on a semi-infinite heat sink. The solution depends on a single new nondimensional number, the \"Lambda\" number, which we define here. This number can be determined from experimental data, and the current density and temperature distribution can then be determined from the results given in this paper. Experimental measurements of the I-V plot for a laboratory diode are shown to agree with the theoretical predictions. The theoretical model, which is based upon the assumption that the heat is entirely produced at the interface between the diode and the heat sink, is shown to agree with numerical results from a finite-difference program in which heat is introduced into a GaAs diode in a plane 0.5 µm above the interface. It is shown that electrical measurements of thermal resistance are related to an \"effective\" temperature which is about 15 percent below the temperature on the diode axis."
"The transfer characteristics of ion-implanted p-channel MOS transistors for small drain-source voltages are measured and compared with a theory based on the in-depth carrier, space charge, and potential profiles, as well as the mobility distribution. MOS transistors with p-n-junctions under the gate area due to ion implantation are characterized by a channel buried in the semiconductor at a depth of 0... 0,2 µm. One result is the classification of implanted transistors into three distinct groups characterized by their buried potential maximum|\\phi_{\\max}| \\geq 2 \\phi_{F}and surface band bending|\\phi_{max}-\\phi_{s}| \\geq\\leq 2\\phi_{F}at threshold. An extended definition of threshold voltage VTOis presented. In the conductance characteristic, VTOresults from an extrapolation to the subthreshold current. This current is nonzero in heavily implanted transistors and is described well by the theory. In the active region, a buried-channel thickness of 0.1 µm is obtained, which extends over the transition from bulk to surface mobility. Models for the mobility distribution including impurity and surface scattering were used to calculate the active-region conductance. The mobility in buried channels and the related transconductance is governed by scattering at the implanted impurity profile. Beyond a characteristic gate voltage, surface channels are obtained, where the mobility is dominated by surface scattering. A good match of the measured conductance characteristics is obtained both in their characteristic nonlinearities and their dependence on an applied substrate bias."
"A new mode of operating a pyroelectric vidicon is demonstrated. It uses a linearly rising voltage ramp applied to the target connection to generate the positive bias across the target necessary for efficient tube operation. The theoretical relationship between lag (time response of the tube to a step impulse signal) and readout efficiency is examined. Lag measurements of a tube operating in ramp mode are used to find the readout efficiency under different operating conditions, and the importance of the beam energy spread of the electron gun in determining the operating efficiency is emphasized."
"A theory of static deflection is presented for conical deflectrons immersed in a uniform axial magnetic field. Both twisted and untwisted deflectrons are considered. Such arrangements for deflecting low-energy electron beams find applications in vidicons, scan converters, and similar devices. The equations of electron motion are solved analytically. Deflection sensitivity, scan rotation angle, and beam landing angle follow from the solutions. It is shown that beam landing error cannot be eliminated in conical deflectrons as it can be in cylindrical deflectrons. Several numerical examples illustrate the uses of these results."
"Measurements of the second current derivative of the external voltage d2V/dI2generated by stripe-geometry (AlGa)As junction lasers are reported and correlated with corresponding measurements of the first derivative dV/dI as a function of current. In the vicinity of the lasing threshold, a pronounced negative peak occurs in the second-derivative signal as a result of the voltage saturation induced by the stimulated emission. With further increases in current, the second derivative assumes nonzero positive values for lasers with incomplete saturation of the junction voltage, while complete saturation is characterized by a near-zero value for the derivative. A pronounced fine structure observed in the second derivative at currents above threshold indicates the presence of perturbations in the saturated state of a nominally well-behaved laser."
"Low-noise and high-speed silicon avalanche photodiodes with low breakdown voltage are reported. The diode structure with a low-high-low impurity density profile is proposed to have low-noise characteristics. Multiplication noise and depletion layer width of several structures are compared theoretically, and effects of impurity density profile of the avalanche region are discussed. Built-in field is also provided to realize high-speed response without increasing operating voltage. Silicon avalanche photodiodes with the above mentioned structure have been fabricated with long time substrate annealing, ion implantation, and epitaxial growth. Attained performances are as follows: noise parameter k = 0.027 - 0.040, output pulse half width τ = 260 ps for a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser pulse, gain-bandwidth product up to 300 GHz at M = 400, quantum efficiency 0.55 - 0.66 at the 0.81- to 0.83-µm wavelength, and breakdown voltage about 100 V."
"Theoretical calculations have been made to allow maximizing the contrast and optimizing the multiplexing capability of rms responding liquid crystal displays. Exact equivalence of the results is shown, and equations for both the multiplexed voltage and the data voltage are written in terms of only the two variables: the OFF voltage (threshold voltage) and the number of multiplexed rows."
"The bulk and surface recombination currents of the E-B space-charge layer are related through a factor XFShaving the dimensions of length. The factor XFScan be determined experimentally and is an essential parameter for modeling hFEfall-off at low collector currents."
"The minority-carrier lifetimes τn0and τp0of bipolar transistors are determined from low-cufrent hFEfall-off. The relative magnitude of surface space-charge-layer recombination current is taken into account. This method is particularly attractive in achieving accurate computer models of bipolar transistors suitable for network analysis and design."
"An explanation is presented to account for discrepancies noted between donor densities determined by magnetoresistance and Hall measurements when high-resistivity layers are present in an epilayer-substrate composite. Experimental data on GaAs and InP samples show that net donor densities tend to reflect that of the most conducting portion of a Hall sample and the most resistive portion of a magnetoresistance sample."
"AM noise of a waveguide cavity Gunn oscillator operating around 33.0 GHz has been measured for frequency off carrier extending from 10 kHz to 1.5 MHz. The measurements indicate that AM noise, (N/C) AM, DSB is typically -165 dB/Hz, at frequencies sufficiently away from the carrier where contribution due to 1/f noise becomes small."
"Possibility of the charge accumulation on a metal of a Schottky barrier, prepared for triggering a Gunn device, is pointed out and experimental evidences shown when a trigger input is fed through another series Schottky barrier of opposite polarity. A theory is developed which shows conditions for avoiding the phenomenon."
"A simple theoretical model based on the concept of impact ionization of carriers is worked out to represent the current-voltage characteristics of bulk semiconductors. The underlying idea is that the carriers start attaining velocity saturation and multiplying themselves soon after acquiring a minimum energy required for impact ionization. Consequently, in a certain region of the device the rate of decrease of resistance with the increase of carrier concentration becomes very high giving rise to negative resistance. The above model agrees fairly well with the experimental results."

"Quantitative analysis of the electron beam induced current makes it possible to evaluate the minority carrier lifetime three dimensionally in the bulk and the surface recombination velocity two dimensionally, with a high spacial resolution. The analysis is based on the concept of the effective excitation strength of the carriers which takes into consideration all possible recombination sources. Two dimensional mapping of the surface recombination velocity of phosphorus-diffused diodes is presented as well as a three dimensional mapping of minority carrier lifetime in ion implanted silicon."
"An integrated circuit technology has been developed to fabricate a matrix array of 32 junction isolated Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCR) for telephone switching systems. Other integrated SCR arrays have employed the more complicated dielectric or air isolation technologies to eliminate parasitic substrate leakages. This leakage in junction isolated structures results from the collection of minority carriers by the substrate. Our technology employs a vertical pnpn structure similar to collector diffusion isolation (1) with a p-substrate, n+buried layer, p-epitaxy, wrap around n+isolation diffusion, implanted n-gate and diffused p+anode regions. Through the use of gold recombination centers for carrier lifetime reduction, the structure achieves substrate leakages of less than one part in 105. The SCRs also have adequately low leakages of typically 10 nA at 30V forward or reverse."
"This paper describes methods that enable us to experimentally determine the recombination lifetimes in the emitter and base of a p-n-junction solar cell and the energy-gap shrinkage in the emitter for the first time. The methods integrate experiment with theory such that the quantitative analysis of the measurements is rigorously based on the underlying device physics."
"This paper discusses the theory of solar cells incorporating impurity gradients as a potential means of improving the efficiency. Both abrupt changes in doping as at high-low junctions and gradual changes resulting in drift fields have been considered. The advantages of high-low junctions have been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally for silicon cells where the minority carrier diffusion length is larger than the cell thickness. Predicted advantages of other drift fields have not been clearly demonstrated. It appears that the advantages of drift fields throughout the device in enhanced carrier collection efficiency are largely offset by reduced open circuit voltages and/or reduced curve factors."
"The classical diffusion theory of the silicon p-n junction solar cell is modified to include the junction generation-recombination current enhanced by field lowering of the thermal bandgap. The method of calculating the short-circuit current from the solar spectrum and the bandgap is refined so as to include optical and electrical losses in the cell. The modified theory explains a wide body of data on three generations of silicon solar cells and removes the previous dilemma of the fall-off in open-circuit voltage and efficiency with increasing doping. Finally, it teaches optimum choices for substrate thickness and doping, and sets goals for future high efficiency cells."
"Diffused p-n junctions formed in vacuum deposited polycrystalline silicon films on sapphire substrates were examined as functions of both diffusion and deposition conditions. Thick films (5-33 µm) with large crystallites suitable for solar cell and large area device applications are described. Comparisons are made between amorphous silicon films converted to polycrystalline during diffusion processing and films deposited in polycrystalline form on hot substrates. Standard integrated-circuit boron and phosphorus diffusion techniques, oxidation, and masking were used throughout the study. Sample purity, diffusion profiles, and junction depths were determined by SIMS. The study shows that junction depth can be controlled within polycrystalline silicon films. Samples with different crystallite size (determined by SEM) were formed at different substrate temperatures. Resistivity, current voltage characteristics, and photovoltaic response are discussed in terms of film parameters and device geometry."
"The principal electrical properties that contribute to the operation of efficient metal/a-Si solar cells have been evaluated. Various metal/ a-Si Schottky barriers have been characterized in terms of barrier height, saturated current density, generation-recombination, built-in potential, and depletion width. The photovoltaic and photoconductive properties of the cell structures have been investigated. The dependence of photocurrents on wavelength and depletion width is presented and minority carrier diffusion effects are discussed."
 "High performance passivated GaAs schottky barrier diodes having an excellent diode n-factor (<1. 10) and a high zero bias cutoff frequency (700 GHz) were developed. Large plated gold bumps supported by thick polyimide allows one to make contact to a small cross-shaped schottky junction area with extremely low parasitic capacitance and inductance. This leads to lower conversion loss and wider bandwidth than can be achieved with conventional planar or beam lead devices. When the diode was used in a single-ended image and sum-enhanced microstrip mixer operating at an rf frequency of 12 GHz and an IF of 550 MHz, a conversion loss of 2.4 dB was achieved with 4 mW of power applied to the diode."
"A monolithic planar beam leaded GaAs mixer diode has been produced by using proton bombardment and a self-aligned metalization technique. Shadow masking of both the proton bombardment beam and the Schottky barrier metalization is used to produce an extremely tight and reproducible device geometry requiring only routine photoresist alignment. Isothermal annealing data has shown that for times in excess of 10,000 hours at normal storage temperatures, the isolation achieved by proton bombardment is not adversely affected. Diodes with a series resistance under 3.0 ohms with a zero bias junction capacitance of 0.06 pF have been realized, giving a zero bias cutoff frequency of 850 GHz. Preliminary RF data on typical devices yield a noise figure of 5.8 dB and a conversion loss of 3.8 at 10.7 GHz."
"High power GaAs gunn diodes, which were made from wafers grown by Ga-AsCl3-N2vapor phase epitaxy, have been developed in the millimeter wave region. It was clear by the computer simulations and the experiments that the output power of gunn diodes at a frequency above 55GHz has been improved by using gradual substrate interface wafers. The gunn diodes, with a diamond heat sink delivered 220mW cw output power with 3.5% efficiency in the frequencies from 50 GHz to 60 GHz and 160mW with 3% efficiency at 65GHz. The gunn diodes operated at a bulk temperature rise of less than 150°C in a maximum output power operating condition. The AM noise (N/C)SSBof the 65GHz stabilized gunn oscillator was -165/1Hz BW at 1MHz off the carrier."
"It is demonstrated that a number of the difficulties which have thus far limited the application of the TRAPATT oscillator may be overcome by optically generating carriers within the device's active region. Illumination with a short light pulse at the beginning of the bias pulse extends the ranges of (i) bias, (ii) circuit tuning, and (iii) temperature over which the duration of leading edge jitter is short. Illumination during the application of the bias pulse significantly shifts the oscillation frequency. It is shown that this effect may be used to eliminate undesirable intra-pulse frequency drift with shaped light pulses. Also, frequency switching in time-frames approaching one RF period are accomplished, which opens up new applications for the TRAPATT oscillator."
"A new operation mode \"Surfing mode\" is proposed and verified experimentally in high-low-type GaAs IMPATTs. This mode is characterized by the concept that the avalanche charge pulse drifts synchronously with the movement of the front edge of the depletion layer at the higher velocity than the scattering-limited velocity. High- -low-type GaAs IMPATTs designed so as to operate effectively in the \"Surfing mode\" exhibited output powers 15 watts (ΔTj=210°C) at 6. 1 GHz 25 percent efficiencies."
"A computer study of a TRAPATT device-circuit interaction has been performed in the time domain under various conditions of pulse rise time and current density. For a 4.3-ns rise-time pulse at 12,000 A/cm2, a movie will be shown which shows the voltage on the coaxial circuit together with the carrier concentrations and electric field in the diode during the starting transient and for one TRAPATT cycle. These results are not adequately explained by existing theory which indicates that a pulse reflected from the circuit triggers the subsequent cycle. Transient and TRAPATT operation of the p+nn+and n+pp+devices will be discussed and compared."
"The switching behavior of pin diodes with short i-layer, used as step-recovery diodes, is discussed on the basis of measurements in the subnanosecond time domain. Special attention is given to the effect of charge storage in the contact layers on the turn-off transition response. It is demonstrated that this additional storage effect is a dominant factor as far as high injection levels are concerned. A large-signal circuit model is presented which is suited for computer-aided circuit design using transient network analysis programs. In contrast to existing circuit models, this model includes all effects responsible for the various phases of the turn-off response observed."
"Unlike conventional lasers, which employ discrete end reflectors, distributed feedback (DFB) lasers utilize an internal periodic structure to produce feedback. These DFB lasers have several desirable attributes, including wavelength selectivity, longitudinal mode control, temperature stability, and well collimated output beams. They are well suited as sources in integrated optical devices. Following a review of GaAs:GaAlAs DFB and distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers in an historical context, a grating coupled ring laser and a buried heterostructure DFB laser are described in detail."
"(Al,Ga)As, GaAs double heterostructure (DH) lasers have received much attention as light sources for optical fiber transmission lines. However, the yield of long life lasers still remain at a quite low level. In order to solve this problem, the author developed a new liquid phase epitaxial growth(LPE) technique characterized by (1) adding GaCl vapor to the growth atmosphere, and (2) using a new boat structure by which multilayer LPE can be carried out without mechanical wipe off of the growth melt. The DH wafer grown by the new LPE technique was quite uniform over whole area (10 × 12 mm2) in the sense that every part of it was suitable for fabrication of long-life lasers. the yield of the lasers which survived through one thousand-hour cw test exceeded fifty percent for specific wafers."
"The properties of silica fibers that are potentially attractive for fiber-optic systems at wavelengths between about 1.0 and 1.2 µm are considered. The features and deficiencies of semiconductor LEDs and lasers that could be used in this wavelength range are then reviewed and compared. These sources include: Si-compensated LEDs of GaAs and InP; ternary homojunctions of (In,Ga)As, In(As,P), and Ga(As,Sb); \"pseudo\" III-Vs or II-VIs such as CuInSe2and CdSnP2; and heterojunction lasers and LEDs of (In,Ga)As/(In,Ga)P, Ga(As,Sb)/ (Al,Ga)(As,Sb), and (In,Ga)(As,P)/InP."
"Room temperature laser diode operation in (AlGa)As is possible to wavelengths as short as 6900 Å. However, the achievement of CW operation becomes increasingly difficult with decreasing wavelength in the 7000 Å range because of a combination of technological and inherent materials limitations. This paper reports on CW laser diodes to wavelengths as short as 7276 Å, the shortest CW laser diode operation achieved to date with any material at room temperature. The characteristics of heterojunction laser diodes operating in the 7000 Å spectral range are discussed and compared with theory."
"A new annealing technique, compositional interdiffusion (CID), has been used to fabricate high performance, single heterostructure diode lasers of Pb1-xSnxSe and PbS1-xSex. These alloy semiconductors cover the infrared region from 3 to 30 µm The improved tunable diode lasers exhibit CW operating temperatures as high as 130K with bias currents limited to 2 Amps. Using temperature variation single lasers have been tuned as much as 400 cm-1, with some lasers having been tuned over the entire 9-12 µm atmospheric window region. Single-ended, CW power outputs as high as 38 mW at a bias current of 2 Amps have been observed from PbS1-xSexlasers fabricated by the new technique. It is shown that the CID effect should occur in other Pb-salt type alloy semiconductors as well."
"Lightwave communication systems employing junction lasers as sources are currently being evaluated in realistic field environments around the World. In many respects, a laser diode is an ideal source for these systems since it emits adequate power for economical fiberguide transmission and is compatible with fibers integrated optics, and integrated circuits, efficient in its conversion of electrical to optical power, mechanically rugged, potentially reliable, and easily modulated in a variety of ways. This paper reviews the modulation characteristics of contemporary cw junction lasers with a view to identifying current limitations on their performance. We focus on the (AlGa)As double-hereto-structure (DH) diode fabricated in a stripe-geometry since this device is the most developed for fiberguide systems."
"An investigation of the power performance limitations or power devices due to thermal failure has been performed under steady-state and transient conditions. The maximum thermal resistance Rθthat prevents thermal runaway under various blocking conditions was computed as a function of applied voltage VAand of leakage current Io. The dependences Rθ=f (VA,Io) were computed for the worst cases and their validity had been proved by experimental data on diodes, transistors and thyristors. The reliability and performance limitations of devices under transient conditions had been investigated for the most complex case, i.e. the transient thermal response of an amplifying gate thyristor (a.g.t.) during its firing. The analytical model and basic computer procedure are described in detail. A good agreement was found between computed values and experimental data for maximum temperature Tm."
"A model is proposed which accounts for the ability of a transistor hot spot to stabilize. It is shown that emitter current-crowding and base-widening play an important role in determining hot spot stability. Experimental results are given which show that the observed peak temperature is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. In addition, the measured onset of second breakdown is consistent with the hypothesis that a critical current density is reached which triggers a low voltage mode of operation. Finally, various precautions are described for interpreting forward second breakdown test data."
"The relationships of thermal instability, stable hot spots, and second breakdown in power transistors are discussed. A rationale is also given for using thermal instability as opposed to second breakdown as the specified limit of safe operation for power transistors. It is shown that the limit of thermal instability can be accurately predicted and the simple device measurements required to do this are described. A rapid, easy, nondestructive test is also described for experimentally determining this limit."
"Current and temperature distributions of multi-emitter power transistors are analysed. The thermal properties, including thermal coupling, are described by a thermal resistance matrix. Anomalous current distributions over the emitter fingers which may lead to second breakdown are shown to be associated with the eigenstates of this matrix. Voltage and current-controlled second breakdown correspond to different eigenstates; the maximum power is inversely proportional to the relevant eigenvalue λ. The presence of emitter (or base) series resistance R gives rise to a thermal breakdown voltage BVTH∞ R/λ below which the device is always stable. The influence of the spacing between emitter fingers and of the quality of the thermal contact between chip and heat sink on the power handling capability is computed. Experimental evidence is presented which supports the theory."
"A two-dimensional mathematical model which includes the avalanche multiplication and internal self-heating effects has been used to predict the internal behavior of a typical high-voltage power transistor design. Collector n--n+interface is the region of high electrical and thermal stresses which cause second breakdown failure at high-current and high-voltage operating conditions."
"A reduction of the surface impurity concentration in the emitter from levels beyond 5 × 1020to levels around 5 × 1019cm-3is known to increase the emitter efficiency, and hence, the d.c. gain of bi-polar transistors at low current levels"
"Our program for semiconductor analysis by finite elements has previously been applied to the analysis of IGFET devices. In this paper we describe the application of an experimental program to a state-of-the-art bipolar transistor in inverse active mode. We compute the hole and electron current distributions across the collector-base junction at low forward biases (the base-emitter junction is shorted). Our results show that (a) the injected hole current (from base to collector) is nearly uniform, and (b) the injected electron current (from collector to base) is greatest under the emitter, decreases under the oxide contact, and rises under the base contact. We conclude with a description of a novel method for solving the difficult problem of maintaining current conservation which is valid for finite elements of arbitrary approximation order. This new method employs Gummel's integral formula for the currents, but avoids the nonphysical \"gaps\" in current flow."
"This paper describes the operation and characterization of an N-channel, double-polysilicon gate MOS structure used in an electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM). The tradeoffs for various structures with regard to writing ability, reading ability, fabrication complexity and ease of erasure are discussed. Measurements of the device are compared to the associated theory, and the sensitivity of the structure to various device parameters is described."
"A discussion of the factors which determine the endurance of thin-oxide MNOS Memory Transistors. Si-SiO2Interface States are influential in the early stages of erase/write cycling, while charge movement into the nitride controls the long term cycling characteristics. The preparation of the thin-oxide region, its composition, dielectric properties and thickness; a high density of spatially localized traps near the nitride/oxide interface; a low conductivity Si3N4dielectric; and optimized electric field strengths permit MNOS Memory Transistors to be operated with high endurance, reliably to beyond 1010erase/write cycles with ± 20v, 100µsec pulses and demonstrate a minimum 2v memory window at 6 months retention time."
"High density in non-volatile MNOS thin oxide memory has been achieved by constructing a crosspoint capacitive cell memory. Since the memory cell is formed at the cross-point of a metal bus and silicon bus, it is perhaps the simplest structure in MNOS memories and gives a theoretical limit on the memory density. An 8×8 matrix of the cross-point memory has been fabricated. Writing and erasing are accomplished with half-select. Reading is accomplished by sensing whether the reading signal is coupled through the memory capacitor or not."
 "A new structural approach to high speed COS/MOS, C2L, results in significant speed and packing density gains. The CDP 1802, single-chip, 8-bit microprocessor as well as several memory and I/O circuits announced recently by the RCA Solid State Division are fabricated in this new bulk CMOS technology, called C2L or Closed COS/MOS Logic. C2L is a self-aligned silicon gate CMOS technology where the gate completely surrounds the drain. This technique does not require the conventional guardbands of standard Al-gate CMOS and thereby significantly increases packing density as well as device speed, and still retains the inherent advantages of CMOS (very low static power dissipation, high noise immunity and operating voltage from 3 to 15 volts at temperatures ranging from -55°C to 125°C). The basic C2L device structure is presented and compared to standard Al-gate CMOS. The speed advantages of C2L devices are discussed, and data comparing the performance of C2L circuits with comparable standard CMOS devices is presented. Generally, C2L devices show an improvement in packing density by a factor of 3 over standard CMOS and operate at frequencies approximately 4 to 6 times faster than standard CMOS. The fabrication sequence for C2L devices requires 6 photomasks (one less than standard CMOS)."
"The propagation delay between any two nodes in a silicon-on-sapphire MOS digital integrated circuit operating at supply voltages near transistor threshold has been observed to be a function of the operating frequency. This effect is attributed to a transient drain current whose magnitude decreases with increasing frequency of applied gate voltage. Evidence of this relationship is discussed as well as possible explanations for the origin of the transient current."
"A review of a chemistry of the three families of photoresist materials commonly used for fabrication of silicon integrated circuits will be presented. The influence of the chemical properties of these materials on the photolithographic processing steps of coating, baking, exposing and developing will be emphasized. Data will be presented on the characteristics of the newest members of these families of resists with respect to each of the photolithographic steps. The limitations of current materials with respect to the newer technologies of projection lithography and physical etching will be explored."
"A novel photomask fabrication method using ion implantation has been developed, where energetic ions are implanted into the patterned resist on a glass substrate. The optical transmission of the resist film was exceedingly decreased and the resist becomes more mechanically and chemically resistant by high energy, high dose ion implantation. These results are suitably applied to photomask fabrication. In this paper process conditions such as types of resist, resist thickness, ion species, energy and dose will be discussed. And some of the evaluation results on the implanted photomasks will be also discussed in relation to optical density, pattern definition, scratch resistance and chemical attacks."
"A low noise microwave bipolar transistor was designed and fabricated with the aid of the BTL electron beam exposure system (EBES) (1). The transistors have nominal 1 µm emitter stripes and were processed on 2-inch silicon wafers. The alignment of the critical levels which were written on the wafers directly by EBES were within 0.25 µm. A self-aligned submicron buffer base region is inserted between the heavily doped inactive base region and the active base region. This buffer base region alleviated the problem of emitter-base shorts without having to lower the inactive base doping. At 1.7 GHz the noise figure ranges from 1.8 - 1.9 dB and the available gain ranges from 11 - 12 dB. The current gain-bandwidth frequency, fT, is 7 GHz at the optimum collector current."
"Experimental plasma etching apparatus and methods utilizing BCl3etch gas have been developed for the accurate patterning of thin Al and Al-Si alloy metallization as used in integrated circuit fabrication. A two micron linewidth capability has been achieved for the patterning of 0.5 micron thick metallization on three inch diameter wafers with positive and negative photoresist etch masks as thin as 2500Å. Etchrates of 500 to 1000 Å/min. are typical, and there is negligible etching of both the photoresist and the underlying SiO2layers. The process is CMOS compatibles, yielding threshold voltage shift and temperature-bias stability specifications of less than ±0.050 volts that are comparable to those for wet chemically etched devices."
"In this paper we shall describe the use of plasma etching and ion implantation to simplify CMOS processing and for tight control of fine dimensions. The above techniques have provided the basis for a CMOS process capable of fabricating devices with geometries as small as 2 microns. The process sequence will be described and some of the problems concerning specific fabrication steps will be discussed. None of the dry etching or ion implantation stages caused degradation of device characteristics. Device stability after step-stress accelerated life testing was of the same order as obtained with devices processed using wet chemical etching and conventional dopant deposition techniques."
"Dry etching is employed in the direct fabrication of the main part of semiconductor devices. A submicron Schottky barrier gate is constructed for GaAs FET's. The gate is composed of double layer metallization. The Au top layer is first delineated by ion milling and the Mo layer in contact with the GaAs substrate is chemically etched in CF4gas plasma. Controlled side etching of the Mo metal produces the submicron gate, leaving a wider top metal of Au. The amount of side etching deviates less than 0.05 µm and the gate length is reduced to 0.1 µm. No appreciable damage to the GaAs substrate is found. Electron mobility is not substantially degraded during the prolonged plasma etching time. The forward I-V relation of the Schottky barrier approximates the ideal characteristics. Half micron gate GaAs FET's fabricated by dry etching achieve high gain and low noise performance in the X-band."
"This paper constitutes a review of the progress made in developing integrated optics (IO) modulators and deflectors. This is now a sizeable group of devices, ranging from IO analogs of bulk Pockels effect and acoustooptic modulators and deflectors, to directional coupler modulators and switches unique to guided wave devices. Although maximum advantage from the use of these components will probably be realized in combination with other guided wave components, i.e., in integrated optics circuits, some will find a place as separate components because of the characteristically low power requirements and small size."
 "This paper describes the construction and performance of an optical time-division multiplex device that is capable of interleaving two optical bit-streams onto one fiber-optic transmission line, and of separating those signals at the receiving end. The device has four ports that interface with multimode fibers, a single strand of fiber being used for each information channel. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a multimode mux/demux device for fiber optics. The operating principles are similar to those of a prior switch (1), but the present device incorporates several improvements: a shorter interaction length (0.4 cm vs 1.3 cm), a more circular channel cross-section for better fiber-matching, and a higher on/off switching ratio (9.0 dB vs 7.1 dB)."
"A method is proposed for characterizing the spatial phase resolution of electro-optic materials. The resolution of these materials is an important factor in determining whether or not they are useful for making spatial phase modulators. The technique is based on a skewed Michelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometer which converts the phase measurement into a distance measurement. A simple device is constructed from a crystal of lithium niobate and the material resolution is measured. Experimental and theoretical results for the induced phase retardation and the components of the internal electric field, compare favorably."
"A serial-in parallel-out device is described consisting of a CCD with 50 output taps which, through amplifiers, address 50 elastomeric diffraction modulators situated on the Si surface. Each modulator functions as a small portion of a Ruticon device with direct electrical rather than photoconductor/light addressing. The device is capable of accepting a 0.5 MHz serial data stream to modulate an illumination source, a laser in the present case, and produce 50 independently modulated optical channels. Test devices have been configured such that an adjacent series of identical modulators can be addressed separately to check the diffraction efficiency of an individual cell as a function of applied voltage. The 50 on-chip amplifiers each have a maximum output swing of 60 volts or better and are capable of giving high diffraction efficiency."
 "This paper surveys the present capabilities of various high-power microwave tubes. Next, new systems trends which result in certain power tube requirements are reviewed. Current tube development work directed toward satisfying the system requirements is then summarized."
"This paper describes a 5.0 kW, Ku-band coupled cavity traveling-wave tube developed for communication ground terminal applications. This high power tube, designated the 870H, was developed by Hughes Aircraft EDD under an internally sponsored program. The 870H features integral solenoid focusing, mod anode electron gun, liquid cooling, and depressed collector. This tube provides 5.0 kW of flat saturated power output over the 14.0 to 14.5 GHz bandwidth and provides the low distortion characteristics required for communication systems. Gain variations will be less than 1 dB peak-to-peak across the entire 500 MHz band. This performance is achieved through the use of special circuit design techniques and an external equalizer."
"This paper describes the development of a high power, grid pulsed T.W.T. being developed for a mobile radar system requiring high efficiency, minimum size and weight. The T.W.T. uses a single section cloverleaf r.f. structure giving good pushing and linearity performance for pulse compression systems and is novel in having a compact P.P.M. focussing system incorporated in the structure. It will be capable of a minimum peak power of 300kW and saturated gain of 20dB in a 9% 1 dB bandwidth. Efficiency should be at least 45% mid-band using collector depression and a frequency dependent velocity taper. The first tubes produced over 300kW with 90% beam transmission when 40% collector depression was used."
"The purpose of this work was to develop a gridded, dual-mode amplifier TWT suitable for the output tube of a multimode airborne radar. The required 10:1 power ratio in the two modes was achieved in the tube design at the maximum drive available of 1 watt. The PPM-focused tube was designed with the use of a computer program which calculates gain, stability, and efficiency of coupled-cavity TWTs. The measured results from the tube agree very closely with the analysis and demonstrate the value of being able to accurately calculate coupled-cavity TWT performance. A comparison of the calculated and measured results for the dual-mode TWT is presented."
"The achievement of high power with light weight and compact size in Varian's coupled-cavity TWTs is accomplished by using several unique design features not commonly used in other coupled-cavity tube designs. These features include stability and sever designs that allow small magnet sizes, the use of relatively large diameter electron beams reducing the required magnetic focusing fields, and the use of high energy product magnets. The sever designs used also lead to excellent gain and phase ripple performance. Polepiece designs provided with extra thermal conductive capacity and giving low transverse magnetic fields are also used in these tubes. These, and other design features leading to high-average power with good beam focusing, are discussed. Performance data, using the design features discussed, will be presented on several X-band TWTs. Special air-cooling designs for depressed collector operation will also be shown and discussed."
 "Novel technology for fabricating gallium antimonide planar tunnel diodes on (III) crystall plane was developed for strain or pressure transducers. Peak current to valley current ratio of eight was obtained routinely and the maximum ratio was about eighteen. The series resistance was between one to five ohms. The fractional peak current change due to the unit strain (gauge factor) was in the range of 180 to 240. The fabrication technology along with the theoretical explanations of the high strain sensitivity is discussed."
"A magnetosensitive device based on the combination of two effects is described: i) the magnetoconcentration effect, ii) the sensitiveness of the reverse saturation current of a Schottky diode to a carrier density excess. The device is fabricated on Germanium slabs and it presents a sensitiveness dV/dB = 25 mV/Gauss[or dV/IdB = 25 V/Gauss A]. This sensitiveness is 200 times higher than that of Hall sensors and larger than that of usual magnetodiodes."
"A new type of temperature-sensitive switching device constructed with a p-n-p -n structure has been developed. This new device can be turned on by a predetermined temperature under the forward bias. This turn-on temperature can be shifted from 50°C to 150°C by connecting gate shunt resistance in parallel with emitter junction of the device. This device owes its features to the thyristor structure which gives contactless and latching switch, gate controlled operation and fast switching. However, several modifications have been made from conventional thyristor design in doping levels and dimensions for temperature-sensitive switching device. The structure, operation, characteristics the feature of the device are described."
"Prototypes of Metal-Oxide Threshold Switches (MOTS) have been built using bulk switching effects in chips of transition metal oxides, in most cases niobium-\"dioxide\", NbO2(x≈2). A 3 mm diameter disc of niobium oxide can pass 100A, millisecond pulses without damage for hundreds of pulses. Chips mounted in microwave diode packages have capacitances of only a few pF, and leakage resistances ranging from the kiloohm to the megohm range in the \"off\" state. The \"on\" state occurs within 500 ps after the threshold voltage has been approached, and within a few (≈2) ns, the voltage across the device begins to drop to a \"holding\" voltage on the order of 20V. Threshold voltages can be varied during manufacture from 60V to the kV range for prototype MOTS. Due to their speed and low capacitance in the \"off\" state, MOTS devices are well suited as high current transient protectors in RF lines. Another application being studied with present prototype is the \"sharpening\" of pulses with undesirably long rise times for use in lasers and radars."
"Transient currents caused by an abrupt switch of the bias voltage applied to an MOS-capacitor on sapphire substrate are measured and analysed to obtain information on the Shockley-Read-Hall centers involved in the inversion charge build-up."
"The determination of both the energy and spatial distribution of interface states of an MOS transistor utilizing charge pumping measurements is described. In order to obtain an Nssenergy profile, charge pumping measurements must be made at several temperatures. The energy profile obtained shows several maxima and minima, but a gradual increase in magnitude as the band edge is approached. The measured energy dependence of Nssshows good correlation with 1/f noise measurements, shows overlap of Nssvalues obtained at different temperatures and shows good correlation between measured Qssvalues and those values calculated from the measured Nssprofile. The spatial distribution of interface states is determined by measuring the frequency dependence of the charge pumping current. The devices tested showed an exponentially decreasing interface state density away from the surface. Information is also obtained on capture cross-sections from the frequency dependence of the charge pumping current. Capture cross-sections are shown to decrease in value from approximately 10-17cm2at 300°K to approximately 10-22cm2at 77°K."
 "Device physics for modelling an I2L gate is discussed. The closest possible relation of the device properties to technology, design and measuring practice has been sought. A standard I2L gate and other versions like oxide-isolated I2L, SFL and Schottky-I2L are considered."
"The Schottky I2L device and a two level metal scheme have been used to fabricate a 24×9 sequential access memory. The T2L compatible chip has 1287 Schottky I2L gates, operates at 60mA, and requires an area of 13,200 mil2. Details of the Schottky I2L technology and its application in a 24×9 sequential access memory will be discussed."
"I2L (Integrated Injection Logic) or MTL (Merged Transistor Logic) is generally considered a low power, medium speed logic technology with high packing density. The standard double diffused structures presently used cannot yield the high speeds necessary for many circuits. However, improvements in the NPN transistor doping profile by \"up-diffusing\" a buried layer P base during N epi growth have greatly increased the speed of I2L circuits. Also, fan out and drive capabilities are improved since transistors fabricated with this process yield betas of over 200 and breakdown voltages of 7 to 10 volts. This compares to standard I2L transistors with betas of 10 and breakdown voltages of 4 volts. Further advantages of the up-diffused I2L are the ease with which Schottky diodes (both for isolation and collector base clamps) and oxide isolation can be incorporated. Junction isolated devices with standard 5 micron geometries yield minimum gate delays of 2.4 nsecs and typical minimum power-delay products of under 0.2 pJ."
"As bipolar device structures get more complicated in geometry and processing, a need for a systematic modeling approach is required to enable device, process, and circuit engineers to communicate effectively in optimizing integrated circuit designs. This paper discusses a generalized modular model that can be used to analyze any arbitrary bipolar transistor or device structure from basic process parameters. The device's impurity profiles are converted into electrical parameters (using a closed recursive equation) that can be used with most circuit analysis programs to represent electrically the physical structures being analyzed. The solution of a general module is presented which allows the D. C. and transient analysis of any bipolar device. With this model, optimum processes and geometries can be developed to meet the required circuit performance. The model thus becomes an interactive tool to characterize a proposed process for a specific circuit or device application. The example shown to demonstrate the power of this modeling technique is the characterization of a simple IIL (MTL) gate delay in a ring oscillator configuration. The agreement between the calculated and measured propagation delay is within 10% over the range of injector currents evaluated."
"In order to use I2L in the low power range the base current must be minimized. Two previous models have been presented to explain the observed base current values. The first model assumes that the observed base current mainly consists of electrons injected into the inactive metal and oxide covered base, whereas the second model claims that hole injection into the epi and buried layer is the main component of base current. These models have been checked experimentally only at moderate or large current levels and at fixed VBEvalues. The purpose of this paper is to investigate experimentally the importance of the different base current components over the entire low current range (0.1 nA - 1µA). Conclusions relevant to the magnitude and the temperature dependence of these different components will be given. It will be demonstrated experimentally that surface recombination in the emitter-base sidewall of the I2L gates is one of the most important contributions to the base current. This component also causes the degradation of the current gain at lower temperatures. Different methods to eliminate this component will be given. New findings about the influence of the deep n+ isolation in the low current range will be presented. The experimental measurements will be illustrated by computer results of one- and two-dimensional computer-aided device analysis programs."
"The reliability of silicon gate N-channel MOS dynamic RAMS is discussed in terms of the primary failure modes of these devices. Analysis of field data and accelerated lifetest results show the majority of failures to be due to oxide defects with smaller percentages of failures caused by contamination and/or masking defects. Specific attention in the paper is directed to oxide defect failures. The temperature and time dependence of these failures is examined and compared to actual device failure rates. Methods of screening defective oxides in actual RAMS are discussed. It is concluded that the weak temperature dependence of this specific failure mode necessitates over voltage stressing as a prescreen. Accelerated life-tests at high temperature and nominal voltages are relatively ineffective in screening these defects."
"A class of dielectric conduction and breakdown which can be dominant in practical MOS devices is described. This mechanism consists of surface conduction along the edge of the thin oxide which separates the gate metal from the underlying silicon. Every type of self-aligning dielectric removal tried including direct cleaving produces an effectively weaker dielectric than existed before the removal. Nearly ideal dielectrics result when the oxide edge is electrically isolated from the conductors. It is suggested that the oxide band structure is significantly altered at local regions near the oxide edge-metal connection. Schottky type conduction is indicated instead of the Fowler-Nordheim type found in bulk oxides."
"Comparisons have been made between silicon gate guardbanded CMOS technology, oxide isolated CMOS and CMOS/SOS. The points of comparison include performance, density and flexibility in layout. The reduction in parasitic capacitance and the elimination of parasitic devices in the last two technologies compared with the guard-banded technology does result in significant advantages. However, only marginal performance improvement of the SOS/CMOS over the oxide isolated CMOS technology is predicted due to effects associated with the SOS material and the floating substrate."
"A new CMOS process has been developed for application in A/D converters, and other analog and analog-digital LSI circuits. High voltage CMOS, isolated vertical NPN transistors, Schottky-barrier diodes and high performance N channel BBD type charge transfer devices may all be realized with the standard six mask process. Two amplifiers have been fabricated, one is designed completely with CMOS and features high gain, while the other uses both CMOS and bipolar devices to achieve moderate gain and fast settling time."
"This paper describes the relationship between excess noise and residual defects of extremely low concentration (<1 × 109cm-2)in ion-implanted MOSFETS. The excess (1/f) noise was measured as a function of the drain current. The activation energy and the density of the residual defects after high temperature annealing was measured using a transient capacitance technique. Test FETs were ion-implanted with a fluence of 5 × 1011∼ 4 × 1012using31p+,11B+, or28Si+species. Post implant anneal was carried out in N2ambient for 20 minutes at various temperatures. For11B+-implanted MOSFETs a high residual defect concentration after annealing above 920° was observed near the band edges whereas the density of defects as a result of28Si+or31p+implantation after annealing was equal to that of control MOSFETs."
"This paper describes the results of calculations and experiments relating to silicon surface characteristics and how they are altered by implanted dopant layers. Properties considered are capacitance-voltage characteristics, doping profiling methods, MOSFET threshold and leakage values and noise levels."
 "A semi-empirical model is proposed to describe the behavior of a 1 µm gate GaAs MESFET in the saturated current region. It divides the MESFET into three sections: an \"ideal\" gradual channel portion (1); an adjacent stationary Gunn domain region extending to the drain (2); and a leakage path shunting these two portions at high drain bias via the non-ideal interface and substrate (3). In portion (1), a pinchoff potential for an ideally abrupt interface is defined. Properties of portions (2) and (3) are inferred from the implications of the gradual channel approximation for portion (1) and the experimental data."
"A noise study of ungated GaAs MESFET's has been made. Measurements of the equivalent noise temperature have been performed in the V.H.F. range. An original simple experimental procedure is described. From these data it is found that the Baechtold relationship : T = To[1+ δ(E/ES)3] between electron noise temperature T and electrical field E holds only roughly for small electrical fields beyond saturation. A noise variation with E3has been measured but the noise coefficient δ is in the range of 3 to 40. For larger electrical fields, noise temperature increases exponentially as a function of the voltage but saturates for higher fields. For all bias conditions noise performance may be greatly deteriorated by contact noise. It is concluded that such a noise characterization provides an accurate and easy method of selecting the best epitaxial layer for low noise FET's before gate deposition."
"In the last few years, several microwave NPN silicon power transistors (1-5) have been reported. This paper presents PNP microwave power transistor. The advantage of this kind of device is seen in high speed switching application with complementary transistors. This type of device allows the total number of devices to be reduced and the performance to be improved in the system or subsystem. The collector-base breakdown voltage (BVCBO) of the order of 90-100 V and the maximum collector current (Icmax) up to 250 mA have been measured. The current gain bandwidth product (ft) in the range of 1.5 GHz to 2 GHz has been obtained. The collector-base capacitance (CCB) at bias voltage of 10 V is about 5 pf with the rise time of the order of a few nanoseconds in the switching application. The collector region of the device is formed by an epitaxially grown p-type layer on a P+doped substrate. An ion implantation technique is used to fabricate guard ring, active base and base contact regions. An emitter diffusion is accomplished by the conventional technique. A gold metal scheme with dielectric passivation is used to provide excellent reliability to the device."
"This report points out the importance of the so-called \"neutral capacitance\" in determining the frequency response of microwave transistors. A simple model of the emitter-base junction capacitance is also presented which leads to the value of optimum concentration gradient for minimum capacitance of the forward-bias junction."
"A method for determining the interface state density in Schottky diodes taking into account both I-V and C-V data while considering the presence of a deep donor level is presented. The model assumes that the barrier height is controlled by the energy distribution of interface states in equilibrium with the metal and the applied potential and does not include, explicitly, an interfacial layer. The model has been applied to extract interface state densities of Au and Al nGaAs guarded Schottky diodes fabricated from bulk and VPE"
 "Consistent with airborne military and satellite requirements for higher frequency traveling-wave tube amplifiers, a new TWT extending the state-of-the-art for conventional helix type TWT's has been developed. This TWT provides 10 watts of CW power at Ka-band, from 35 to 40 GHz and represents the highest CW power level developed to date in a helix type, PPM focused TWT. The RF circuit is a precision wound tungsten helix (. 029 inch mean diameter) supported by four BeO rods. A low perveance design was chosen leading to a moderate 5% beam efficiency. The efficiency is enhanced to 20% by the use of an efficient single stage depressed collector. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical design of the TWT as well as the important design criteria for a high reliability, long-life TWT. Thermal analysis of the helix circuit will be presented along with details of its fabrication and assembly."
 "In the power-from-space application for microwaves, gigawatts of solar-derived energy are to be relayed efficiently and continuously from equatorial geosynchronous orbit to earth by means of a microwave beam and then converted into base-load electrical power. The complete system has been studied in considerable detail, and the following set of requirements has been established for the microwave generator: high efficiency, a capability to radiate directly into space waste heat resulting from any inefficiency, an operating frequency of 2450 MHz, extremely long life and reliability measured in terms of scores of years, a very high signal-to-noise ratio, a high ratio of power output to mass, and a low cost of manufacture. Broad bandwidth, high gain, and a vacuum-tight enclosure are not required. Using this set of requirements, the design of a CFA of the continuous-cathode, reentrant-beam type has been studied in detail. The resulting device has the following characteristics: 85-90% overall efficiency, 6.5 kW of continuous output power, 2450 MHz frequency, 7 dB gain, 3.6 1b weight including samarium-cobalt magnet, pyrolytic graphite cooling radiator, and constant power output regulation system. Long life and high reliability are obtained with the use of a pure-metal secondary emitting cathode."
"This presentation concerns concepts and computer-aided design analyses of a high efficiency klystron cw amplifier for space power applications. It derives from experience with the Varian VKS-7773 50 kW S-band cw klystron amplifier, a 28 kV 2.4 A 50 dB gain tube operating at 2450 MHz with 74.4% efficiency."
"This paper describes the 14 and 30 GHz TWT's which were designed specifically for the earth stations of the new experimental broadcasting satellite and communications satellite experiments. The coupled cavity type RF circuits of these tubes were severed into three sections and optimized to the requirements for their frequency coverage and efficiency. Each TWT has one stage depressed collector and is cooled by only one blower including the electro-magnet for beam focusing. The 14 GHz TWT can deliver more than 2 kW CW power output with 40 dB gain and the 30 GHz TWT can deliver more than 400 W CW power output with 36 dB gain. Group delay of 1 nS over the TV channel for the broadcasting experiment, and AM-PM conversion of 5 °/dB in the 30 GHz TWT are also measured."
"The Varian VKU-7812 six-cavity klystron amplifier produces 2 kW of communications quality cw power at 20 percent efficiency with 30 dB gain over 250 MHz 1 dB bandwidth within the 14.0 to 14.5 GHz frequency band. This compact new tube employs permanent-magnet focusing and is entirely air cooled. The double-tuned, filter-loaded output circuit provides an interaction impedance of five to six thousand ohms over the bandpass. The microperveance 1.25, convergence 50 electron gun produces a high quality 0.03 inch diameter beam which is confined within the 0.05 inch tunnel by a pair of samarium cobalt radially magnetized magnets producing a main field of 5 kg. Intercavity drift lengths, R/Q and driver cavity loading were computer optimized for gain, bandwidth and efficiency with minimum magnet size, while also eliminating gain cancellations."
  "The use of semiconductor arrays in image tubes is becoming increasingly important in a wide variety of applications. This paper will summarize the Digicon fabrication methods, and will describe several new devices that are in development. Two of the most interesting new devices include intensified charge coupled devices (ICCDs) and APD Digicons which use avalanche photodiodes to detect photoelectrons. In the case of the ICCD, test results will be given and single photoelectron pulse height distributions shown. Test results will also be given on the APD Digicon. This new rugged and potentially low cost photomultiplier device may find use in a number of high speed applications, such as laser ranging and high speed optical communication."
"A highly linear position sensitive photodetector (PSD) has been developed to be used in a new measuring system (SELSPOT) for high accuracy non-contacting remote position monitoring of light sources (eg. LEDs). Due to the superior linearity (max non-linearity 0.1%) high sensitivity (0.6 A/W) and extremely high resolution (better than one part in 50 000) the detector opens up new areas of applications in the field of high accuracy measurements."
"Silicon n+-p-π-p+avalanche photodiodes, having high speed (1 ns response time), low noise and high current gain, have been developed for optical fiber communications. These detectors provide a 16 dB improvement in sensitivity over nonavalanching photodiodes in optical receivers operating at 825 nm and 44.7 Mbit/sec. To facilitate fabrication on large diameter wafers, achieve uniform avalanche gain, and obtain quantum efficiencies greater than 90% at 800 to 850 nm, the avalanche photodiodes are constructed from 50 µm thick, high resistivity epitaxial silicon. At an average gain of 100, their resulting excess noise factor is only 4 to 6 times the shot noise limit. Low dark currents and good reliability are achieved through the use of guard rings, channel stops, bulk and surface gettering, dielectric passivation and surface field plates."
"Design criteria for a broadband high gain-bandwidth-product silicon avalanche photodiode are given. The structure and fabrication steps of a diode are presented, which meet these criteria. It is a thin-silicon-film structure, which uses a highly reflecting back contact to increase the internal quantum efficiency. The temporal and wavelength response are given. The measurements confirm the expected excellent characteristic."
"Thin-silicon-film mesa-shaped pin-photodiodes are presented, which exhibit high internal quantum efficiency at risetimes below 100 ps using a grated highly reflecting back contact and total reflection at the top. Theoretical and typical experimental data are given. Transparent photodiodes fabricated in a similar way are introduced, which can be inserted into an optical transmission path to take out a fraction of power without the need of an optical coupler."
"Progress toward achieving high gain, avalanche photodiodes operating at 1.06µm is described. 1.06µm photodiodes have been fabricated (3 mil × 3 mil) with average gain of >14 at a leakage current of 150 na. These devices are fabricated from GaAs1-xSbxmaterial grown by LPE on GaAs substrates. Multiple layer step graded structures are used to reduce stress in the active layers. A self-terminated depletion region design has been found to give significant improvement in gain uniformity."
"Photosensors based on n-type GaAsP have been investigated in two types of structures: MOS layers with anodic insulators, and Be-implanted diodes. The MOS sensors show low dark current, long storage times, and response to nearly the entire visible spectrum. These sensors have storage times exceeding 500 seconds and are limited by oxide leakage current. Optically generated holes are collected under the gate and read out by a charge injection technique. Applications to sample and hold detection are discussed. The photodiodes, formed by implanting Be in n-type GaAsP, have high sensitivity, large dynamic range, and a 50 nanosecond rise time at zero bias. They are potentially useful as low light level high speed photodetectors."
    "One of the concerns with electron beam pattern definition of IGFETs is the effect of radiation on transfer characteristics. Several types of devices with different gate structures have been fabricated using electron beam lithography. A description of the structures is presented with emphasis on horizontal geometries. The critical device parameters are then discussed and compared with those of IGFETs fabricated with conventional photolithography, and also with conventional devices subjected to electron radiation. Device characteristics are shown after several annealing conditions. It is found that radiation effects can be removed totally on MOS structures; however, residual effects are observed on MNOS and SNOS devices having vertical structures as described. A model for radiation effects and annealing behavior is presented."
"GaAs Schottky barrier FET's employing crossover technology have been fabricated using electron lithography for direct exposure on the wafer. Submicron realignments to gate structures with 2µm minimum feature sizes have been regularly achieved. Direct wafer exposure offers the advantages of high resolution, accurate alignment, flexibility in making design changes and speed in turnaround time but the processes used to pattern the substrate are different than those used with photoresist technology. The processing details as well as D.C. and R.F. results are described. At 4.4 GHz a crossover device with a gate width of 7mm produced a saturation power of 3.1 watts, a 1 db compression power of 2.5 watts and a small signal gain of 5.0 dB. Another device with a gate width of 3.5mm has produced a saturation power of 1.8 watts, a 1 dB compression power of 1.4 watts and a small signal gain of 6.0 dB."
 "This paper describes the electrical and optical properties of tin oxide-gallium arsenide heterojunctions. These structures, comprising a highly conducting, wide gap semiconductor in contact with a lightly doped, narrower gap semiconductor substrate, have promise for photovoltaic applications. Epitaxial layers of gallium arsenide were grown by the reaction of trimethylgallium and arsine. These were covered with tin oxide, which was formed by the oxidation of tetramethyltin. All processing is described for eliminating photo-suppression effects in these structures. The photo-response and the electrical characteristics of the cells are also described."
"We have prepared cells of polycrystalline N-AlAs on p-GaAs on graphite, with the III-V semiconductor layers grown by chloride transport vapor phase deposition. From the photocurrent response versus wavelength we infer electron diffusion lengths of 1.8 and 1.0 µm in the polycrystal GaAs at hole concentrations p ∼ 4 and 8 × 1018cm-3respectively. This indicates peak internal quantum efficiency exceeding 90%. External power efficiencies are limited by the large spreading resistance in the top AlAs layer due to poor majority carrier transfer across grain boundaries."
"The current-voltage characteristics of a CdS/Cu2S solar cell is explained in terms of the contributing physical effects: Minority carrier generation, recombination, and diffusion in Cu2S, a Schottky barrier layer with sliding boundary condition, nx=0(j), at the junction interface for applied voltages near Vocand current saturation due to high field domains at voltages below Voc-VDlimiting the currents to values below the saturation current in the Cu2S. Conditions are given for lifting this current ceiling. The model shows substantially improved agreement with the experiment than the previously used diode model."
"The effective height of a Schottky barrier solar cell can be increased by implanting a thin layer (∼ 100Å) of impurity of opposite conductivity to that of the substrate. The implanted solar cell becomes insensitive to changes in interfacial oxide, surface state densities and work function. The maximum open circuit voltage thus fabricated was 0.52 V. The short circuit current for this cell was 25 mA cm-2(without interdigitated metallization or antireflection coating). Open circuit voltage is related to the steepness of the implant doping density gradient near the metal-semiconductor interface. Thus, implantation is superior to diffusion doping in that it provides the doping density gradient of maximum steepness. Analysis shows that the range of the implant must be less than 100Å and the dosage greater than 1013cm-2to achieve maximum open circuit voltage."
"A study has been made of recombination mechanisms at grain boundaries in (n-type) polycrystalline semiconductors under optical illumination. The results have been correlated with the minority carrier lifetime (τ) in the material. The recombination velocity at grain boundaries is enhanced by the band bending or diffusion potential (Vd) adjacent to the boundaries. Under illumination, the population of the interface states is altered considerably from its dark level and as a result, Vddecreases to that value which maximizes recombination (equal concentrations of electrons and holes at the boundary). This means that τ decreases with Nd. The dependence of τ on the doping concentration (Nd), grain size (d) and interface state density (Nis) at the grain boundaries in (n-type) polycrystalline semiconductors has been calculated analytically."
"The minority carrier diffusion length in the base region of a solar cell is an important factor affecting the conversion efficiency and spectral response of the cell. Conventional methods for the measurement of minority carrier diffusion lengths in semiconductor materials are generally unsuitable for measurements on completed solar cells. This paper describes a simple and direct technique for the measurement of minority carrier diffusion length in solar cells, It has been applied to both single crystalline and polycrystalline silicon solar cells, and the results compared to standard surface photovoltage measurements."
"A 2000V, 800A light-activated thyristor, suitable for use in high power circuitry of the type required by the electric utility industry is described. Unlike a conventional thyristor which is turned on by an electrical signal to the gate electrode, this device is turned on by an optical pulse, from a solid state light-source, that is conveyed to the silicon device via a light pipe. The key design objectives were to create a device structure capable of being fired by a low energy light pulse in a reliable manner, while maintaining a short and uniform delay time and a dV/dt rating in excess of 300V/µsec. A design approach is described that has resulted in a better understanding of the physics of firing a high power thyristor with a small light energy. Considered are gate amplification, the area of illuminated silicon, the duration of the light pulse and the conductivity type and the surface preparation of the light sensitive area. Evaluation data shows that a light pulse with only 0.3 µJ of energy can be used to fire the thyristor, reliably and with low switching loss, with uniform delay times of < 1 µsec and turn-on times of < 3.5 µsec. A quantity of these devices is being produced for use in an experimental power electronics system."
"A 1000V, 200A gate-assisted turn-off thyristor (GATT) is described that was developed for, and is being used in, circuitry for space applications requiring high efficiency and reliability as well as small size and weight. The design features include an interdigitated shunted cathode, a dynamic gate, a means for optimizing the carrier lifetime level, and a bypass diode. The bypass diode is necessary to permit the combination of both dynamic turn-on and gate-assisted turn-off in the same device. Two versions of this diode are described. The device physics of gate-assisted turn-off will be reviewed. Based on this, improvements in the design will be described. It is shown that a prime failure mode can be eliminated and that the gate-assist signal voltage can be substantially decreased by employing a shunted cathode emitter. The test data show excellent turn-on characteristics due to the dynamic gate and the long perimeter of the edge of the main cathode. Turn-off times as short as 3 µsec are obtained. The effect of the gate-assist current on the turn-off time is described. The combination of controlling the carrier lifetime with a precisely controlled and easily variable irradiation dose of high energy electrons with gate assist current provides for simple, precision tailoring of the device characteristics to the intended application."
"There is growing interest in the use of platinum as a lifetime control element in bipolar devices. This paper discusses key differences between the conventionally used gold lifetime killer and platinum, with particular emphasis on high injection effects and high temperature effects. It is shown that generation at platinum impurity centers is orders of magnitude less than at gold centers, allowing improved high temperature leakage. It is also shown that minority carrier lifetime decreases with increasing current when platinum is used, causing forward dissipation difficulties. No such effect has been seen with gold. Platinum can provide improved turn-on performance and high temperature leakage in devices which are switched so rapidly that the turn-off is governed mainly by the high injection lifetime. When the switching wave form involves low injection recombination tails, the shorter high injection lifetime leads to prohibitively high forward dissipation, and gold is preferable to platinum."
"Recombination statistics, based upon a single dominant level, have been used to predict the relative characteristics of gold diffused, platinum diffused, and electron irradiated silicon. These calculations indicate that gold diffused devices will have the best trade-off curve between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time while exhibiting the highest leakage current levels. The leakage currents of platinum diffused devices are comparable to electron irradiated devices but have a better forward drop-reverse recovery trade-off curve. These calculations have been experimentally verified."
"In this paper, four layer power thyristors are analyzed using exact numerical solutions of the full set of semiconductor device equations together with the heat flow equation. Included in the analysis are the physical mechanisms of carrier-carrier scattering, Auger and SRH recomgination, and band gap narrowing. The experimental current-voltage curves for three thyristor structures are compared with the theoretical predictions and are shown to be in good agreement. The limiting effects on device behavior of the physical mechanisms noted above included heat sink thermal impedance are investigated over the range of device operating conditions. The distribution of power dissipation throughout the device is shown and compared with the distribution of recombination in the device. The theory of calculating power dissipation in a semiconductor is also discussed."
"A technique is described whereby free-carrier infrared absorption can be used to measure the density of injected electrons and holes within a semiconductor device. Experimental plots of steady state distributions at various current levels, and the open circuit decay of the injected charge distribution are shown for p-i-n rectifier structures both before and after electron irradiation. Anomalous behavior is observed in the open circuit decay of the charge distribution of the electron irradiated device."
"The application of computers to the design of microwave tubes is discussed under four headings: 1) What do you intend to achieve? 2) What equipment or services do you need? 3) How should you use the equipment? 4) What can you really expect to get from it? The objectives include warning about danger points as well as simply designing to meet the specifications with minimum cut-and try. The relative merits of in-house and time-sharing computers are considered. The author favors time-sharing for its flexibility, but costs vary widely. It is recommended that computers be used directly by engineers, without intervening computer staff wherever possible. Examples are given of the way that computers can help develop understanding, as well as giving numerical results."
"Deviations from ideal PPM focusing of electron beams are calculated by means of paraxial-ray equations by a simple program on a time-sharing computer. Such calculations are of interest to rapidly predict the effect of variations of operating conditions and the tolerance in designing TWT focusing systems. The objective is to eliminate cut and try adjustment of the PPM stack (\"shimming\"). Previously published differential equations are integrated numerically for the symmetrical cases which include variation of magnetic field level, non-ideal beam injection, and random variations from magnet to magnet. Additional terms are added to take into account asymmetrical effects."
"Most electron beams in TWT's are not perfect. The current density varies with distance and with radius (i.e., beam scalloping occurs). There are nonlaminarities due to initial beam formation and due to beam focusing peculiarities and which are most prevalent in PPM tubes, and which appear to be most severe in dual mode PPM TWT's. These non-laminarities result in beams that can be approximated by laminar beams which vary in beam current density as a function of beam radius and circuit distance. The major effects of beam shape variation from an ideal beam are to reduce the efficiency of the TWT by factors of 2 to 4. The reduction in efficiency is highly dependent upon beam size as well as beam shape. Most computer programs use a beam with uniform current density in the beam as a function of radius and distance. This paper presents results from two different computer models, one relating beam shape (i.e., radius), the other to beam scalloping (i.e., distance)."
"Computer software has been developed to analyze an arbitrary electrostatic lens system containing geometric asymmetries such as those produced by tolerance variations and electrode misalignment, and predict the behavior of an electron beam in such a lens system. The method employed separates the type of asymmetry from the magnitude of the asymmetry in a particular lens system, thereby greatly reducing the bulk of calculations. The software produces a graphic display of electron trajectories through the actual symmetric lens system. Additionally, coefficients are calculated which describe electron beam deflection as well as departures from the cardinal lens properties of the ideal rotationally symmetric lens system produced by the geometric asymmetry. This software package allows the designer to determine the effect of tolerance variations and other asymmetries on lens performance, thereby enabling him to determine tolerance criteria for the lens. The types of asymmetries and tolerance variations dealt with are: ellipticity, enlargement, offset and tilting of electrodes with respect to the axis of the lens system. Results predicted by the software have been experimentally verified."
 "The objectives of this development were to improve the average power capability, gain and efficiency of a predecessor PPM-focused dual mode TWT described in 1975(1). The circuit for the new tube is also of the coupled-cavity type with a center frequency of 9.5 GHz. The new circuit is liquid cooled and provides 500 watts average output power in the high mode with 11 kW peak power and 54 dB gain. In the low mode the average output power is 700 watts with 1.4 kW peak power stud 29 dB gain. The basic efficiency without collector depression is 15 percent in the high mode and 8 percent in the low mode. Overall efficiencies increase to 36 percent and 24 percent in high and low modes with a two-stage collector depressed to 60 and 80 percent of cathode voltage. The collector designed for this tube employs a novel arrangement of collinear hyperbolic elements, displaced to one side of the tube axis. Allowing for beam interception stud rf circuit losses, the implied collector efficiencies range from 75 to 83 percent."
"The paper describes a method for defining the initial electron beam conditions for a planar cathode which is subject to space charge limited emission in an axially symmetric field. The method, a refinement of J. E. Boers' technique for describing cathode conditions, has improved the correlation with empirical results. Features described are: a) noniterative computation of the space charge density factor; b) current density limit based upon empirical data from production cathodes; c) Monte Carlo assignment of thermal speed; and d) correction for \"captured\" trajectories at the beam periphery."
"The interest in the nonuniformities in response of infrared detectors has increased recently due to the increased number of detectors being considered for future infrared sensors. This paper identifies how large a uniformity problem exists for various types of detectors and indicates the possible causes of the observed variation. Detector nonuniformity and present on-chip correction techniques can be considered within the two categories of scanning and staring systems. They are discussed separately since applicable correction techniques either need to be developed or are different. A survey is made of the nonuniformities encountered in the fabrication of detector arrays of photoconductive (PC) HgCdTe, PC PbS, PC Si:In and photovoltaic (PV) InSb. A discussion is not made of the use of calibration data stored in system signal processing memory because this straightforward approach will probably be located off focal plane."
"Detection of 2-5 micrometer infrared radiation is important both for earth resources and for thermal imaging applications. In this paper we present new results on 2-5µm (Hg, Cd)Te photodiode arrays. 2.1µm photodiodes achieve D* = 6.0 × 1010cm Hz1/2/W at 300K and D* = 5.0 × 1012cm Hz1/2/W at 193K. The photodiodes have surface leakage resistance greater than 1.0 × 1012Ω. The devices display no 1/f noise to less than 0.1 Hz and have response linear in signal power to better than 0.5 percent. Arrays display uniformity of responsivity within ± 3 percent. The diode saturation current is limited by generation-recombination in the depletion layer with an effective lifetime of 6.0 × 10-8sec. 2.7µm photodiodes achieve D*λ= 1.0 × 1010cm Hz1/2/W at 300K and D*λ= 5.0 × 1011cm Hz1/2/W at 193K. 4.8µm photodiodes achieve D*λ= 8.0 × 1010cm Hz1/2/W at 170K and 2.0 × 1012cm Hz1/2/W at 77K and zero background. This paper will present these recent data and compare them with theory."
"Heterojunction p-InAs.95Sb.05/n-InSb photodiodes have been fabricated using gas phase epitaxially grown material. The major differences between the performance of homojunction InSb and these devices will be discussed. It will be shown that detectors produced from this epitaxial material exhibit background-limited performance, excellent uniformity and enhanced blue response. Characteristics such as detectivity, responsivity, dynamic range and noise figures will be presented. Applications of these detectors in infrared optical systems will be pointed out."
"The development of the InSb MIS technology and associated CID imaging arrays has progressed rapidly. At present, high-sensitivity line arrays and operating two-dimensional arrays have been fabricated. Photon-noise-limited performance has been achieved in line arrays, all the noise sources of the device have been identified and modeled, and the results compare favorably with the theoretical values. For background photon flux levels higher than mid-1012photons/sec-cm2, the device performance is practically background limited (BLIP). In the lower background region at 77°K, however, the shot noise associated with the thermally generated dark current limits device sensitivity."
"The effects of temperature noise on the performance of pyroelectric detectors have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The basic theory of temperature noise, techniques for its measurement, and a comparison of it to other noise sources is presented. In LiTaO3pyroelectric detectors specially designed to minimize temperature noise, normalized detectivities (D*) of 1.8×109cmHz1/2W-1or noise equivalent powers (NEP) of 5×10-11W Hz1/2have been obtained."
"New pyroelectric vidicons (PEVs) have been developed employing targets of tri-glycine fluoroberyllate (TGFB) and deuterated triglycine fluoroberyllate (DTGFB). These tubes provide significant advances in the state-of-the-art of PEV performance. The best performance of PEVs previously reported was a panning-mode minimum resolvable temperature (MRT) of 1°C at 250 television lines/picture height (TVL/PH) with a pedestal current of 100 nA for tubes having triglycine sulfate (TGS) targets and non-crossover guns. Under the same conditions, the PEVs with these new target materials show an MRT of approximately 0.5°C at 250 TVL/PH."
"Process techniques for the reduction of parasitic capacitances in VMOS transistors (1) have been developed. Significant reductions in gate to drain overlap capacitance and side wall component of the junction capacitance have been achieved for a high performance VMOS process."
"A process has been designed which allows the simultaneous fabrication of V-groove MOS (VMOS) and double-diffused MOS (DMOS) transistors. The main objective of this work was to characterize and compare the physical and electrical properties of the two MOS devices. Physical parameters of the VMOS transistors were extracted from their vertical impurity profile measured by spreading resistance. The measured channel lengths and peak impurity concentrations were correlated with the gain factor and threshold voltage for several fabrication schedules. Properties of the lateral impurity profile were inferred from a comparison of the electrical characteristics of the VMOS and DMOS devices. In order to accurately model device performance in the saturated region, a one-dimensional solution of Poisson's equation was derived for the region surrounding the channel-substrate junction."
"A physical model of the V-channel MOST is proposed which takes into account a non-uniform redistribution of oxide charge in the V-channel region during the fabrication process. Analysis of the surface potential and threshold voltage along the channel is carried out by a conformal mapping approach. For p-channel devices studied, good agreement has been obtained between the predictions of this model and measured d.c. and gm characteristics. Conclusions are drawn also on the influence of the oxide charge distribution on the characteristics of n-channel V-MOST's."
"An n-channel self-aligned doubly ion implanted lateral V-MOS structure (D-V-MOS) for high performance LSI IC application is described. The new structure is an improved D-MOS structure. The effective channel of the D-V-MOS is formed by the vertical difference in a n-type and a p-type impurity profile on a p-substrate through a V-grooving technique. Thus, the threshold voltage and channel length of the D-V-MOS can be directly and more accurately controlled through ion implantation. In addition, super short channel lengths on the same order of magnitude as the base width of a bipolar transistor -- 0.1 um can be realized, resulting in a further improvement in frequency response. A depletion mode lateral V-MOS is used as load device for E/D operation. The fabrication process for the self-aligned self-isolated n-channel E/D D-V-MOS device is simple -- only 5 masking steps are required. The short channel effect associated with the D-V-MOS is discussed. It is found that for channel length less than 0.6um, the substrate sensitivity due to the source-to-substrate biase is significantly reduced even with a 1000 A gate."
 "A numerical two dimmensional simulation has been used to demonstrate the effect of IGFET channel width on threshold voltage. The computed results agree well with experiments and are used to build an understanding of the mechanism. Potential, field and carrier concentration distributions are used to provide a picture of the geometric interactions."
"Punchthrough operation of a short-channel MOSFET device to obtain a temperature-stable output voltage is described. The MOSFET is operated as a two-terminal device with its gate, source and substrate connected to ground, and a variable current source connected to its drain. When the voltage that is developed at the drain of the device, Vr, exceeds punchthrough, the sensitivity of Vrto changes in ambient temperature, T, can be minimized at any chosen temperature, Tc, by selecting an appropriate current density, Jopt. For constant Jopt, a deviation of approximately 10 ppM/°C is predicted for Vrover the temperature range from 200 to 300°K. Experimentally, deviations as low as 1 ppM/°C have been measured over a 100°C temperature range."
"The fabrication procedure and device characteristics of MOSFETs having a unique gate electrode structure are described. The polysilicon gate electrode of the structure is self-aligned on its ends with respect to the conductive source and drain regions, and it is also self-aligned on its sides with respect to the nonconductive field oxide isolation regions. This double self-alignment feature results in a polysilicon gate electrode area that matches the channel region of the FET. Another novel feature of this device is a self-registering electtical connection between the gate and the metallic interconnection pattern. An oxidation barrier layer of silicon nitride is used to prevent oxidation over the gate. When the nitride layer is removed, the entire gate area is revealed for contacting by a metal line. This misregistration tolerant contacting technique and the doubly self-aligned gate electrode structure yield small FETs with increased packing density. The novel fabrication procedure can lead to the formation of nonplanar microstructural features which nevertheless can be controlled by proper choice of processing variables. The experimental electrical characteristics of the new FET structure are quite similar to those of larger area MOSFETs fabricated using more conventional methods."
"A two level metal structure is described for beam leaded silicon integrated circuits. The two level structure consists of a Ti-Pt first level, plasma deposited silicon nitride as interlevel dielectric, and Ti-Pt-Au as a second level. An example of the application of the structure to a bipolar LSI circuit is presented for the case of a 24 × 9 bit sequential access memory implemented with a Schottky I2L technology."
"Previous work with polycrystalline isolation was limited in density by enhanced diffusion which precluded walled emitter geometries. Oxide isolation schemes are limited in depth by loss of planarity due to oxide bumps and resultant degradation in photolithographic definitions. A technique has been developed which combines polycrystalline isolation of collectors and shallow oxide isolation of bases. This approach is capable of proriding deep dielectric isolation, surface planarity and the high density of walled emitter geometries, a combination heretofore unobtainable by any other means. This isolation scheme has been used to fabricate ECL gate chains. The transistors were located in 2.5 micron thick n-epi islands surrounded by 5 × 105ohm-cm polysilicon selectively oxidized with silicon nitride masking to a thickness of one micron. The oxide bump at the nitride mask was typically 3000 Å and the epipoly step height was as small as 2600 Å. The circuits have polysilicon resistors and were fabricated using both thermal diffusion and ion implantation. The speed-power product of these circuits was approximately one-half that of junction isolated circuits."
"It is shown that the ionized-cluster beam deposition and epitaxial techniques are useful for the semiconductor device fabrications. In this technique, the vapour, on emerging from the nozzle, is partially condensed into clusters with the Van der Waals force. The clusters are then ionized by electron bombardment and accelerated onto the substrate. The deposited film shows good adhesion, good conductive even in a very thin film, and good crystalline state. These techniques are applied to ohmic contact, interconnection, and semiconductor material preparation for devices and ICs."
"A program for modeling IC fabrication processes is described. Simulated and measured impurity profiles are shown for a bipolar transistor technology. The simulated profiles are used to study sensitivities in electrical device parameters. A comparison of simulated device performance using process models gives parameters which bracket measured results for 35 die across a wafer."
"The interference of incident laser light with light reflected from dielectric interfaces is important in the completeness with which a laser beam vaporizes thin metal films, even though the dielectric layers lie underneath the metal film being vaporized. A structure consisting of titanium-platinum links on a two level dielectric consisting of silicon nitride and silicon dioxide on a silicon substrate was used to demonstrate the effect. The resistance of laser vaporized titanium-platinum links varied by more than seven orders of magnitude as the thickness of the silicon dioxide, the lower dielectric, was varied. The thicknesses of underlying dielectric layers are, therefore, parameters which must be taken into account when using a laser beam to produce high resistance open circuits in metal films."
"This review considers various mechanisms which either generate or modulate light: injection luminescence, impact excited electro- and cathodo- luminescences, glow discharge, liquid crystals, electrophoresis, plating, electrochromism."
"The liquid crystal light valve (LCLV) is a photoactivated electro-optic device that is designed to transfer images from one beam of light to another. It is being developed primarily for application to large screen video display of both alpha numeric/graphic and pictorial television imagery. However, it is also useful in the conversion of images from non-coherent to spatially coherent light, and from visible to IR light. Basically the device consists of a glass substrate upon which is deposited thin films of indium-tin oxide, a CdS photo-sensor, a CdTe light-absorbing layer, and a dielectric mirror. A second glass substrate is coated with a thin film indium-tin oxide transparent electrode. The two substrates sandwich between them a thin layer of an appropriate nematic liquid crystal. The resulting device has several important features. It has high input sensitivity (<100 µW/cm2at 525 nm), high resolution (>1500 lines/inch at 50 percent MTF), high contrast (>100:1), television-compatible speed (30 frames/sec.). Moreover, it is capable of very substantial image intensification (>105). Devices having apertures of two inches are fabricated routinely on fiber optics substrates. These devises can then be coupled directly to a 2- inch diameter fiber optics faceplate CRT primary (input) display to constitute a compact device package. In this talk we will describe the basic light valve device, discuss the various liquid crystal electro-optic effects that we use in these devices and characterize the performance that we obtain from them."
"We have developed a recyclable, transmission type photoconductivity controlled liquid crystal light valve suitable for real or quasi real-time optical reconstruction of long wave holograms. This device combines an organic photoconductor PVK/TNF (Poly-N-vinylcarbazole/2,4, 7-trinitro-9-fluorenone) film and a thin liquid crystalline layer. While several types of photoactivated light valves have been developed for a variety of purposes, the current one differs from previous versions in that the fabrication of the device is probably the easiest and least expensive, because of the type of photoconductor and the mode of operation involved. Most importantly, it is capable of reconstructing excellent optical images from long wave holograms. The reconstruction of holograms, even at long wave range, is probably one of the most stringent performance tests for any light valve intended to be used as a noncoherent-to-coherent optical image converter, or as an optical-to-optical interface device. Thus, we have not merely characterized the device by MTF measurement for its resolution capability, and optimized its performance in sensitization, addressing irradiance and applied voltage. In addition, we have evaluated and demonstrated its performance with the aid of a microwave test hologram transparency in an optical-bench simulation of a real-time reconstruction. The retrieved image is probably the first of its kind from a light valve. The experimental data are further explained by the proposed macroscopic device model, which governs the possible optimal operating conditions and suggests potential design flexibilities. A general assessment of the device is discussed, based on the quality of the reconstructed image, the device structure and the operating conditions."
"The scanning limitations of rms responding liquid crystal devices due to the lack of sharpness of the transmittance characteristic can be overcome in the case of the twisted nematic configuration. Indeed, it is possible to obtain a linear output polarization from an electrically excited cell, and then to decrease the transmittance level of the non selected dots without altering the optical efficiency for the selected dots by rotating the output polarizer perpendicularly to the transmitted vibration. A 64 × 64 element matrix display using a biphenyl compound has been constructed and operated in the transmissive mode. The contrast ratio obtained with a duty factor equal to 1/128 corresponding to a 128 line display is 20 : 1. The address and the information pulses respectively applied to the lines and the columns are V1= 12.4 V and V2= ± 1.1 V."
"The preparation and performance of GaAs and GaInAs 1.06µm LEDs and 1.15µm detectors is described. In each case the basic device material is prepared by a vapour phase hydride growth process and p-n junctions are grown-in during epitaxy by switching dopant sources during growth. LED 'p' type doping levels in the 8 × 1018- 4 × 1019holes/ cc range are used to assess the trade off of device speed and radiance with carrier density. These results are given and so demonstrate the possibility of fabricating LEDs with 3dB modulation bandwidths exceeding 500 MHz. Life test data on these LEDs is also reported. Detectors with quantum efficiency of 80% at 1.15 microns and RC limited rise times of 5 nsec are obtained and their I-V characteristics given."
"The differential equation for current flow in an etched-well type LED is solved. This solution leads to design criteria for the optimization of these devices. These criteria are that the sheet resistance of the p-layers be as large as possible (for a p-type active layer), the sheet resistance of the n-layer be as small as possible, and the ratio of contact diameter to well diameter be as large as possible. Measurements of optical power coupled into a fiber are in excellent agreement with predictions of the model assuming unity internal quantum efficiency."
"A method of thinning the substrate under the junctions has been developed to improve the extraction of light through the front surface of LED's. This new technique has been applied to diodes made by Ga(AsP):N / GaP and Ga(AsP) / GaAs technologies. An increase in efficiency of a factor 3 is demonstrated. A simple theoretical model is presented."
"The relationship between reliability and derating in traveling wave tubes (TWTs) is often disregarded. It is ignored because of competitive business pressures and incomplete design capability evaluation. Adequate derating will produce significant reliability improvements as compared to units operated at their capability limits. In order to do this, however, each TWT's true capability limits must be determined. Maintainability, as used in this discussion, refers to the maintenance of the TWT's electrical and thermal environment. Since most TWTs are not field repairable, there is little that can be done to the device itself to assure its continued operation once it has been produced. Therefore, design consideration must be given to require (by the TWT) versus existing field environments."
"A novel heater-package consists of one or more thin layers of chemically machined metal compressed under temperature into a solid block of high purity alumina ceramic. High power level tubes, especially of small size and high efficiency, require cathodes capable of high emission densities. Tungsten matrix cathodes are often used. These cathodes are capable of up to 5 amperes per square centimeter of cathode surface area. Unfortunately, these cathodes operate between 1100 to 1200 C. The heaters for these cathodes operate at even higher temperatures. It is not unusual to see 1500 C or 1600 C heater temperatures. The heater life is seriously diminished, due to sag, evaporation, embrittlement and electrochemical effects. When the new heater is used in heater-cathode packages, the heater temperature is typically less than 1350 C for cathode temperatures above 1100 C. The photo-etched or chemically machined pattern is usually bifilar, the precise geometry and cancelling action result in minimum stray magnetic field on the cathode surface. The low heater temperature and turn to turn voltages minimize the electrolytic action. The voids characteristic of presently used potted heaters are absent, making this heater suitable for D.C. operation. The time to reach full operating temperature after application of the heater voltage is minimized allowing \"quick start\" operation. The heater-ceramic package can be potted into a groove machined in the cathode matrix, located so as to obtain the uniform cathode temperature. D.C. operation, heater cycling, efficiency and other tests, including life, will be discussed. Comparison with known heater cathode packages will be made."
"The bonded grid consists of a metal-insulator-metal sandwich attached directly to an impregnated tungsten cathode. The metallic top surface of the grid structure is the control grid, and the metallic surface on the bottom provides a diffusion barrier for barium between the cathode and the insulator. The major advantage of this design approach is that the close tolerance required in grid cathode spacings is easily obtained and maintained with the cathode in hot condition. The first bonded grid structure described in the paper was developed for a microwave triode having a grid-to-cathode spacing of 2 mils. The dimensions of the grid cells are 5 × 35 mils. The grid structure consists of a thin wafer of anisotropic boron nitride insulator metallized on both sides by RF sputtering. The fabrication techniques were later extended to construction of convergent guns for linear-beam tubes. The progress and the problem areas experienced in both phases of this program are discussed."
"Electron tubes with small internal volume often fail by arcing when turned on after extended shelf life. We have identified the major failure mechanism in a particular tube type which has an internal volume of 0.1 cm3by using quadrupole mass analysis (QMA) of internal gases and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) of impurity deposits on internal electrodes. The major failure mechanism is the release of nitrogen from ceramic voids during microcrack propagation. This gas adsorbs on the filament, electrodes, and internal tube surfaces and is released by thermal and electron stimulated desorption when the tube is turned on."
"This paper presents a status report on the development of methods for using diamond supports for helix slow-wave structures in TWT's. The motivation for using diamonds in this fashion is the need for higher average output power octave bandwidth coverage in the higher frequency regions. The limit of average output power for octave bandwidth helix TWT's is determined by the thermal conduction from the helix to the outer shell, and has always been directly related to the helix support material. Progress was made by replacing glass with alumina, and alumina with beryllia and boron nitride. Natural diamond is an excellent dielectric and has a thermal conductivity over three times better than copper and ten times better than beryllia. The use of diamond dielectric helix supports, therefore, provides the next logical step to increase the output power of helix TWT's. In recent years, the necessary technology has been developed to metalize and braze diamonds for use in diamond-supported helix structures."
"An Electron Bombarded Semiconductor (EBS) amplifier has been developed which has a combination of characteristics which make it an attractive alternative to metal-ceramic triodes and transistors for generation of high peak powers at lower microwave frequencies. These characteristics include small size, high gain, high reliability and high peak output power. This EBS amplifier has operated at up to 700 W peak output power at 1 GHz with a maximum gain of 27 dB, a bandwidth of 40 MHz, and a target efficiency of 35%. The EBS uses a 10-12 kV electron beam to illuminate a reverse-biased semiconductor diode, producing current gain in excess of 1000 by impact ionization of the silicon. Output matching is performed by a quarter-wave cavity mounted externally to the tube, making it possible to interchange cavities for operation at up to 1.5 GHz. Modifications to the existing design are expected to result in peak output powers in excess of 1-2 kW peak at 1 GHz."
"Two design approaches are presented to an EBS signal processor that multiplexes multiple input data lines into a single output (parallel-to-serial conversion) with 2 Gbit/s serial output data rate. The first approach uses a CRT-type electron gun, eight input gates, and one silicon diode target. The second approach uses multiple electron sources, multiple input gates, and a single silicon diode target. A gating system is used to present to the target a 0.5-ns aperture time per electron gun. This approach is much less sensitive to misalignment and power supply and RF input drive instabilities than the first approach. In addition, higher output signal amplitudes and a smaller tube were achieved. Output pulse characteristics demonstrated at the 2 Gbit/s data rate are 5 to 7V pulse amplitude into 50Ω and less than 0.25 ns pulse risetime."

Among the low-amplitude uses are underwater sound transmission for locating submarines, measuring the depth and detail of ocean bottoms, flaw detection in materials, delay lines for storing informtion and for performing processing calculations, and many medical applications such as locating cancers and other imperfections in the human body. Ultrasound waves have ben used in many physical investigations. When tho amplitude of the sound wave becomes large, some non-linear effects occur such as the produotion of cavities in liquids and fatigue In solids. These give rise to another set of applications such as ultrasonic cleaning, emulsification of liquids, machining of materials, and tests for fatigue in materials - particularly when a number of cycles is required. Biological applications such as the destruction of bacteria and the use of foamed ultrasound as a surgical knife are also possible. It is the purpose of this paper to provide the historical background leadlng to these applications and to discuss some of them in detail."

"In this paper it is suggested that the magnetic pinch effect at the electrode/arc column junction is responsible for local current density enhancement and the consequent copious emission of electrode vapour into the column of an SF6arc. This hypothesis is supported by measurements of electron density and arc temperature in the column vapour core and by the agreement of pinch theory with empirical relationships. Since the vapour core decay current is less than the inception current (∼ 20 kA) then for very high peak currents an enhanced vapour density can exist at current zero. The high electrical conductivity associated with this vapour can thus have a deleterious effect on voltage recovery in a practical circuit breaker."
"Recent concern over abnormal stresses imposed on the shafts of large turbine-generators, due to high speed switching of network faults, has led to intensive investigation of this phenomenon. Elaborate computer programs were developed for simulated model studies which revealed that hitherto unexpectedly high shaft stresses can occur merely by tripping a three-phase short circuit near the power station at an unfavorable instant. The effects of circuit breaker reclosing, both successful and unsuccessful, were also investigated together with those due to faulty synchronizing. Test data on a 780 MVA unit gained by telemetric means verified the calculated torques and established the damping coefficients in a running unit. The adverse influence of numerous repetitive instances of such over-stressing on life expenditure of rotor materials is being evaluated."
"This paper describes a method of determining the maximum probable rates at which power system frequency will decay following a disturbance which results in an overload on the available generation. The analysis is based on the maximum electrical load which a generator-transformer combination will accept as a function of the characteristics of the unit and the system to which it is connected and the initial operating conditions. The analysis and results presented are of value in providing underfrequency protection for nuclear plants and in the application of frequency relays for load shedding purposes."
"While the problem of disruptive failure of distribution transformers has received much recent study, uncertainty still remains as to the precise phenomena which cause cover blowing or tank distortion. This paper presents some new insights into the mechanisms of cover blowing based on a comprehensive and highly instrumented test program. Unique contributions from this study should help clarify many points which have been the subject of much discussion during the last few years. Besides observing and correlating the effects of various arcs drawn inside several different transformers, some actual failed transformers were tested and the effects of the failures observed and measured, giving a better understanding of what occurs while a transformer is in the process of failing. Special tests using high speed photography have confirmed the existence of failure modes which up to now have been only suspected. In addition, measurements from these tests have verified theoretical studies and so have helped provide a more complete picture of the diverse phenomena involved. Practical solutions to the cover blowing phenomena are discussed."
"Impedances are defined for all conductors which constitute a submarine single-core cable: the central conductor, the metallic sheath, the reinforcement if any, the armor and the sea. Impedances of magnetic armor are considered in some detail and relevant numerical data are given. The presence of other cables, far apart in the sea, is taken into consideration. Rules for composition of impedances are given, from which the additional losses of the cable and the distribution of current between various conductors are computed."
"The paper describes a general three phase load flow program developed for the steady state analysis of any electric transmission network under all possible imbalance conditions such as untransposed EHV lines, single phase loading, single pole switching, etc. Input data preparation and output data interpretation are made easy for program users by using both phase and symmetrical components quantities; however, the load flow problem formulation and solution are all done in phase quantities (A, B, C). The method of solution is the Newton-Raphson method, using optimally ordered triangular factorization to take advantage of the sparsity of network equations. The program has several new features to simulate real three phase operation of power systems and imbalance conditions. For example, the internal induced voltages of generators are balanced, while generator terminal voltages depend on internal machine impedances and the imbalance in machine currents. Also, the steady state performance of the voltage regulator is simulated to maintain some function of the machine terminal phase voltages constant, depending on the actual design of the voltage measurement. Another feature of the program is that it can handle all common transformer connections having two or three windings that are used in HV transmission networks."
"A digital computer program is described which predicts the acoustic noise generated by the magnetic field in an induction motor. The motor air gap may have static or dynamic eccentricities, and the squirrel cage rotor may be skewed or unskewed. Besides calculating the sound power in decibels at any motor speed, other important performance parameters such as steady and harmonic (cogging) torques, magnetic side pulls, currents, and the variation of the magnetic field along the stack are computed. The sound power spectrum predicted for a particular motor is compared with laboratory measurements."
"This paper presents the method used to include the equations for DC converters and transmission lines directly in a Newton AC system power flow. The DC equations are presented in a per unit form that is compatible with the per unit AC equations. The DC equations can therefore be incorporated directly into the Jacobian of the Newton power flow. The convergence properties of the Newton method are not altered. The DC model and equations used make it possible to investigate any number of two terminal DC lines or multiple terminal DC networks as component parts of an AC system."
"The step response of three-phase pipe-type cable is determined. The solution techniques are closed form and analogous to those developed by Carson for overhead transmission lines. Results are shown for cradled and triangular configurations. The Fast Fourier Transform is used for calculation, dramatically reducing computation time. Delay of the zero sequence wave and attenuation of all components are shown. Calculations neglect saturation of the pipe wall, which follows in a later paper. The results can be incorporated into existing digital transients programs or be used to construct complex frequency-dependent analog models for Transient Network Analyzer (TNA)Studies."
"This paper describes solution and simulation techniques which result in an efficient and practical approach to long-term stability studies on digital computers. These efficiencies are derived from two algorithms used alternately to simulate large power systems. A technique for algebraization of differential equations, including the simultaneous solution of all network equations, is discussed. The results of testing the solution technique on large systems are included."
"A new technique has been developed for the measurement of the fine structure of the cathodic emission in a moving arc. The results obtained give evidence for the initiation and extinction of individual emitting sites and allow the determination of the current they carry. The lifetime of the sites is determined from the exponential-like decay in the number of extinction of emitting sites following a perturbation of the arc. On copper, in air, for a 700 A arc typical values are: microcurrent 0.6 A, lifetime 1 µs, dI/dt 3 × 107A/s, current density 1014A/m2. In addition, an electron microscope study of the surface using a replica technique - magnification 24000 X - has revealed the existence of 0.1 µm craters and of 1 µm ring-clusters made up of 0.1 µm unit craters. There is no directional motion of the craters. The motion of the discharge is accompanied by the formation of an excess of emitting sites over extinguishing sites located at the front of the arc, while the opposite is true at the rear of the arc."
"Exact determination of current distribution along a grounding electrode is, in all practical purpose, only solvable by successive approximations. In this paper various methods which solve accurately the most general problem of interconnected electrodes are presented and discussed. One of these methods called herein the Multi Step Analysis seems to have definitive advantages with respect to accuracy, computing time and simplicity. It is hoped that the following will be helpful for those who are concerned with a reasonable accurate design of grounding networks which takes into account the overall parameters of the system."
"Failure and circuit upset of electronic equipment due to transients is a problem now and is one which has promise of becoming more of a problem in the future as trends continue toward miniaturization and circuit complexity. Protection methods are used more or less extensively and often haphazardly. At present, there does not appear to be a clear approach toward achieving compatibility between the transient withstand capability of devices and the transients to which such devices are exposed. A more scientific approach is needed to guide manufacturers and users of equipment. The purpose of this paper is to promote a concept of transient coordination for electronic and other low-voltage equipment through the establishment of a system of Transient Control Levels, similar to the concept of Basic Insulation Levels so successfully used for many years in the electric power industry. Specific suggestions for possible Transient Control Levels and standard test wave shapes are made, in order to promote wide discussion as to whether these waveforms and levels are the best that can be developed toward good transient coordination for the electronic industry."
"This relates to the applicability of TenaxRpaper made of poly(2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide) fibers to EHV cable insulation. Tenax paper shows excellent thermal stability in DDB impregnant even at 150° and its impulse strength has been improved significantly. Long-term dielectric test on model cable suggests that Tenax paper insulation may provide an EHV cable capable of operating at 25 kV/mm and 120°. Some experimental 275 kV cables are manufactured and offer much valuable imformation. Additional calculation based on the data available indicates that Tenax paper insulated oil-filled cables rated at lOO0 KV may offer much power capability advantage."
"The experimental results showing the relation between rate of rise of recovery voltage (RRRV) and percentage of N2- SF6mixture, by pressure, are reported. A description of the test vehicle and the test procedure is also included. For a constant di/dt the optimum interrupter performance, judged in terms of its voltage recovery capability, is observed to occur when the SF6mixed with N2is in the range of 40 to 50 percent. In the limited range of pressures tested, the voltage recovery capability showed to be proportional to the upstream pressure raised to the 1.5 power."
"The generation of torque in A.C. machines is not well understood by engineers. National and international standards define only average steady state values and do not cover transient or oscillatory components. The only transient data routinely provided by the manufacturer is short circuit torques. This situation leaves the application engineer in a poor position to properly apply motors or generators. The user needs the complete torque picture. It is the purpose of this paper to present easily usable formulas and a physical picture of torque generation by A.C. machines and thereby fill this long standing need. This paper should eliminate the need for new standards as has been proposed since the data for torque calculation is normally available. Practical and interesting cases will be explored to develop a clear understanding of the nature of A.C. machine torques and their calculation. Torque is a basic physical quantity that can be treated independently and not as a dependent function of power and energy. Each element of a winding under transient as well as steady state conditions contributes a value of torque that is the triple vector product of the radius, the current, and the flux density T-= R-r×(I-×B-). This wholly empirical formula is firmly established as Langsdorf explains it is the basis for the work that follows."
"The paper describes a method of representing a group of induction motor loads by a single-unit equivalent. The dynamic performance of the composite group following supply disturbances is examined using the single unit model. The representation employs the induction motor steady state equivalent circuit mad allows for effects of inertia and mechanical load characteristics. Experimental results are presented and compared with corresponding theoretical results using the proposed method as well as classical techniques of analysis. Sudden and gradual supply disturbances are considered, and different load torque-speed characteristics."
"This paper discusses a three-and-one-half-year study of constantly energized 500 kV station-post insulator performance in a coastal environment where ocean salt, moderate industrial contaminant, and coastal fog are encountered. Under test at PG and E's Moss Landing EHV Laboratory are semiconductive, siliconed, and untreated porcelain glazed posts. Semiconductive and full length siliconed posts have not flashed over during the test period. Multiple flashovers of the untreated posts in nighttime fog have required summer hotwashing to allow continued testing."
"This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation of the static field anode corona characteristics in SF6over a wide range of gas pressures and field non-uniformities. In addition to the experimental study the theoretical streamer onset voltages of the various test gap geometry-pressure configurations were calculated and these are compared with the experimentally determined breakdown voltages and onset levels of the various stages of prebreakdown current activity. Also discussed is a method of estimating the minimum gas. pressure at which breakdown occurs in the absence of positive DC corona in a non-uniform field."
"The results are reported of a project designed to reduce the magnitude of transient high-frequency electromagnetic field disturbances near 230-kV line disconnect switches by structural shielding. A reduction in peak transient electric fields from 600 volts per meter to an equipment specification value of 1 volt per meter at the site of a large computer installation has been obtained. The transient field waveforms and measurement methods are described."
"This paper describes the effects of the system zero-sequence network impedances and bus capacitance on circuit breaker transient recovery voltage requirements for EHV systems. Three basic types of faults are considered: three-phase-to-ground terminal faults, three-phase ungrounded terminal faults, and short line faults. Comparisons are presented between conventional methods of calculation used in the ANSI and IEC Standards and a more exact method which considers a simulation of the zero-sequence impedance of the system, including frequency dependence of the line surge impedances. The sensitivity of transient recovery voltages to bus capacitance is also shown for both source and line-side capacitances. The effect of bundled subconductors clashing at high fault levels is also shown and an approximate method of predicting the clashed configuration is presented. Comments on circuit breaker testing are included."
"A new algorithm is described to solve the static, time-invariant weighted least-square state-estimation problem for large-scale electric power systems. The solution is obtained through P-θ and Q-V decoupling and alternately iterating the active and reactive equations using fixed, simplified submatrices of the information matrix. Thus, a much faster algorithm is obtained yielding the exact solution and requiring little computer storage. The new method is compared with the basic \"Weighted-least-square\" and the \"Line-Only\" algorithms on a practical HV network."
"Subsynchronous resonance (SSR) has arisen as a phenomenon that has the potential for damage to turbine-generators. Intensive work has been and continues to be performed to devise methods of analyzing SSR phenomena, and to develop means to prevent SSR when a problem. A bibliography of references applicable to the study of SSR is presented to facilitate further work."
"This paper develops the joint use of several new concepts for improving stability, reliability, and safety of a double-circuit three-phase EHV line: 1. Use of selective-pole switching; that is, only the faulted conductors are opened and reclosed. 2. Exclusive use of that arrangement of conductors that gives the least current to ground from a large vehicle capacitively coupled to the line: like phases are in diagonally opposite positions. 3. Use of bank of 3 shunt capacitors and 9 shunt reactors for neutralizing the 15 interconductor capacitances and thereby eliminating the shunt capacitive coupling that tends to maintain the secondary fault arc. 4. Sectionalizing the faulted conductor or conductors into two or more longitudinal sections by remote-controlled switches in order to reduce the longitudinal resistive-inductive coupling that also tends to maintain the secondary fault arc. These concepts are illustrated by applying all of them to a simulated 735-kV, heavily loaded, 200-mile line having 6 bundles of 4 Chukar conductors each."
"Southern California Edison Company has been involved in research and development to provide a firm basis for seismic design requirements and practices for substation facilities. These efforts have resulted in the attainment of a better understanding of the seismic withstand characteristics of Edison's substation facilities as well as design changes for the seismic improvement of shunt capacitor racks and circuit breakers. A close liaison has been maintained with consultants and academic personnel throughout the current seismic testing program resulting in the development of analytical and testing techniques for the seismic design of equipment and structures. This has enabled Edison to increase their understanding of seismic methodology. The following paper outlines the approach which Edison has taken towards research into improved testing and analytical methods in order to establish more precise and economical means of verifying the seismic withstand requirements of substation equipment and structures. The concept of dynamic rating for substation apparatus and structures is also introduced."
"The application of optimal control theory to damp the electromechanical oscillations associated with the transient conditions in power systems has been given little attention. A suboptimal control law which minimizes the sum of the performance indices of the two linear systems given by a piece-wise linear model of a power system improves the transient stability better than the usual \"optimal\" control law obtained from a linearized model. Further, the suboptimal control law presented in this paper assures stability of the system for all disturbances resulting in rotor oscillations of magnitudes less than a preselected limit."
"Transductors, sometimes called dc current transformers, are in widespread use for the measurement of large direct currents, of the order of 1000 amperes and above. The transductor described in this paper has errors of much less than 10-4over most of its current range. In addition, this transductor requires considerably less core material than a standard transductor of the same current rating."
"This research explores the basic hypothesis that microporosity may play a significant role in the mechanism of breakdown of XLPE cable. The potential improvement achieved by impregnating the cable core with a neutral liquid is evaluated, in relation to ac voltage life and impulse strength. The effect at higher frequency voltage is also considered. Absence of measurable discharge on cable samples at very high stress raises some question regarding the role of partial discharges in relation to the mechanism of dielectric fatigue and breakdown. The possibilities of alternative electronic mechanisms are discussed. Studies are continuing under this EPRI/DOI research contract."

"Generally the most severe test for a current limiting fuse occurs in its critical current range, where the maximum thermal energy is released during the fault interruption.

"The original ERC - Manufacturers, 500/550 kV Cable Research test schedule was successfully completed [1] in August 1972 and most of the basic data has been presented [2]. A follow-on program designed to search for end-points has run its course and it is now appropriate to describe the events and consider their significance in EHV system design. Cyclic thermal loading has been postulated as a cause of EHV Cable system problems. This paper relates specifically to test specimen A and its performance in a high thermal load study at the Waltz Mill test facility [3]. The end point was reached but the failure mode appeared to be one of mechanical origin and will require further tests."
"An earlier paper described a method for recognizing the uncertainty in loss-of-load probability (LOLP) as computed for a single-area system due to uncertainty in generator forced outage rates. This was done by treating generator forced outage rates as random variables with known means and variances and computing, exactly, the resulting mean and variance of LOLP. The mean and variance of LOLP were then used to compute, approximately, the limits between which LOLP can be expected to vary with specified probability. The present paper presents approximate methods for computing the variances and covariances of generating capacity outage state probabilities and of LOLP variance in systems with or without maintenance outages. These approximate methods offer significant savings in computer time and storage as compared to exact methods while maintaining excellent accuracy."

"An effective method is presented for performing reactive power control in a bulk power supply system by optimally rescheduling generator terminal voltage magnitudes and/or transformer tap settings. The optimization procedure is the familar least squares minimization technique and is suitable for on-line application in energy control center computers. Sensitivity factors provide the basis for the control function and are developed from a linearized reactive power model. Important features of this method include a model approximating the reactive power flow through a load-tap-changing (LTC) transformer and a Norton's equivalent circuit model approximating the reactive power output of a regulating generator. As a result of the linear models developed, optimally ordered triangular factorization is fully exploited to enhance computational speed and efficiency. Test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. A linearized active power model is briefly presented to illustrate its dual relationship to the linearized reactive power model. This is an important relationship, enabling both active and reactive power control by application of the same general model."

"The envelope of earth surface potential curves is distinctly convex for grounding mats with many meshes. Such a condition is difficult to analyze with the established methods, which are primarily devised for calculating the corner mesh voltage. For this reason, a large, equally spaced grid may be overdesigned toward the center and underdesigned toward the perimeter. Aiming to remedy such problems, this paper analyzes and modifies the existing method of IEEE Guide No. 80, to allow a recursive point by point integration of surface gradients through consecutive meshes. A computer program for optimized grid design is described and the effect of spacing geometry is documented by computer plotted voltage profiles."
 "A digital simulation program used for the design of improved automatic generation control algorithms is described. The program can also be used for study of long-term system dynamics following large load or generation changes. Since the simulation runs faster than real-time, the program, can be used as a real-time power system simulator for control system checkout and operator training. The simulation represents the major Pacific Northwest powerplants plus equivalents for the interconnected power system. Included is a newly developed Kaplan hydro turbine model. Automatic generation Control models include non-linear digital filtering and recently developed digital powerplant controllers.For stochastic load changes, close statistical comparison was obtained between simulation and actual system records."

The method presented allows direct computation of the self-and mutual inductances fop lumped sections and is shown to be accurate compared to classical methods."
"This paper deals with the problem of formulating dispatching algorithms which must trade off power system operating cost with system security effects. Decision theory was used to structure optimization algorithms which dispatch a power system in accordance with different security strategies. The strategies themselves are dictated by how one wishes to treat probabilistic load variations and contingency events. The chief value of this research lies in providing an approach to unifying the techniques of stochastic power flows, contingency analysis and constrained optimization."

After that, a numerical dc field mapping method for electric field analysis of two-dimensional configurations which consist of composite insulation and field mapping methods under combined ac-dc voltage and dc reversed polarity voltage were proposed. Futhermore, partial discharge characteristics of transformer insulation under dc, combined ac-dc voltage were experimentally made clear by practical trial models."

"The paper describes analytical and experimental results for a new method of current harmonic reduction in thyristor converters. The principle of the method is to modify the current waveforms on the d.c. windings of the converter transformer by injecting harmonic currents at a particular frequency. In practice, third harmonic currents of the power frequency is most efficient. Experimental results carried out prove that the method is effective in reducing the alternating-current harmonics, and that it is applicable to any type of thyristor converters."
"Power systems with longitudinal structure may be subjected to poorly damped oscillations at low frequencies; the structure of speed governors and of excitation controls may have a considerable influence on damping of these oscillations. The strong influence of generator position on damping efficiency is analyzed, as are the effects of load location and load characteristics on the damping improvement that may be expected from additional feedback in excitation control. Some schematizations make it possible to obtain a qualitative insight into the influence of different parameters on oscillation damping. An example of slow oscillation damping in the Italian system is given."
"Since the potential consequences of the subsynchronous resonance phenomenon were encountered in 1970, concern has escalated among those electric utilities which rely upon series compensation to seek reliable methods for determining the existing power systems subsynchronous stability margins. In the several publications available on this subject, no attempt has been made to represent the synchronous machine governing and excitation control systems in the mathematical models devised, particularly when the torsional dynamics of the shaft are considered. It is the main objective of this paper to present a rigorous mathematical technique for the evaluation of the subsynchronous resonance stability limits of regulated synchronous machines connected through series compensated transmission systems. The results of a digital simulation of the suggested mathematical technique is also presented. The investigations presented show that properly designed electrohydraulic governors can improve considerably the subsynchronous resonance stability limits. On the other hand, practical voltage regulators seem to be unable to achieve such an improvement."
"Two 420 kV SF6-insulated tubular bus systems, 600m and 700m long, have been completed in the spring of 1975. The three-phase systems consist of isolated-phase transmission lines and form the power link for the Wehr pumped-storage plant. After a brief description of the electrical data specified and of the mechanical design, the authors describe the large number of electrical tests carried out. These included laboratory tests, which were concluded by type-testing of the tubular bus and metalclad surge diverter, and routine tests on insulators and diverters. Special attention was also paid to the performance of the equipment under various fictitious fault conditions, and several test series were carried out for this purpose. For the test at the site, an oscillating switching impulse voltage was applied."

"Increasing pressures to limit transmission facilities while increasing the utilization of remote coal reserves and generating station sites is proving a challenge to the nation's utilities. Delays in obtaining construction permits, intervener actions, and difficulties in obtaining the required capital for financing have added to the challenge. The generator excitation controls can play an important role in achieving the goal of high service reliability under conditions which tend to reduce stability margins. High initial response excitation systems with high ceiling voltage capabilities can produce significant performance improvements, particularly in conjunction with power system stabilizer controls. A new concept featuring a high initial response excitation system has been developed which combines the excitation system power supply as an integral part of the generator design, utilizing common parts and cooling systems. Analytical prediction of the on-line performance of this new excitation concept is a vital requirement for both detailed design of the equipment and confirmation of power system design. Correlation of analytical results with factory test data on the prototype unit, The Montana Power Company Colstrip No. 1, establishes a measure of confidence in the ability to predict performance of this new equipment."
"The results of an electrostatic measurements program held in conjunction with the IEEE Working Group on E/S and E/M Effects of Transmission Lines and attended by representatives of several organizations are presented.

"Audible noise duo to corona on high-voltage transmission line conductors can be reduced by introducing an asymmetry into the conductor bundle geometry. Predetermination of the optmum arrangement of conductors can be extremely involved and is best investigated by analyzing the performance of individual subconductors in the bundle.

The results obtained allow one to compute the noise performance of any bundle configuration. Calculations are compared to the measured performances for two different bundle arrangememts."
"Recent undamped oscillations in the Western U.S. power system have indicated the need to improve system damping. The development of a control algorithm for small-signal modulation of the Pacific HVDC Intertie is described. The control signal which would be applied to the current regulator at the sending end of the dc intertie is based on rate of change of ac-intertie power. Results from simulation studies are presented which show that modulation will produce considerable damping."

The new similarity laws, presented here, are derived from the equations of non-dimensional groups, known as similarity criteria, which include the quantities describing the system and the phenomenon. Detailed results on the influence of the line parameters on the corona loss characteristics of monopolar, homopolar and bipolar lines are given."
"This paper details the use of computerized magnetic field solutions, based on magnetic vector potential, to develop a simplified approach to the calculation of saturated values of steady state reactances of turbogenerators under various load conditions. When magnetic nonlinearity of the stator and rotor materials is taken into account, the turbogenerator reactances become dependent on the saturation conditions in the machine, which are a function of the operating conditions (terminal voltage, current and power factor). Quadrature axis synchronous reactances are reduced by as much as 40% from their classical unsaturated values under rated load. Torque angles deduced from the model at rated load are lower by as much as 20% than values obtained by standard methods. The method is applied to two typical 4-pole, 659 MVA and 2-pole, 733 MVA turbogenerators of the gas inner-coaled type. Supportive shop floor test results are provided."

Mathematical expressions have been established to represent these results, and some explanation has been attempted by the study of the electrostatic field distribution."
"A power pool consists of a number of interconnected electric utilities referred to as pool members that coordinate their operations to improve reliability and produce an optimal allocation of generation. The coordination takes place by recognizing the pool as a multiarea system and allocating generation for each area separately, then combining the individual allocations to form a total allocation on the pool level. Mathematical models are required for the allocation of generation both on the pool level and on the area level. The paper presents a procedure of creating such models, applicable to both off-line studies and real time operations, and represents an extension of work reported earlier by the authors."
"A new high quality universal voltage divider was developed as a result of theoretical and experimental investigations. Various kinds of tests have been carried out on the divider in order to confirm its performance. The results show that the divider has a response time of about 10 ns and is capable of measuring voltage of various waveforms accurately from lightning impulse to dc voltage."
"The withstand strength of contaminated insulators under practical field conditions depends on the type and distribution of contaminants as well as their conductivity. In this paper, the authors have investigated the dependence of flashover voltage on the chemical composition of multicomponent contaminants and have proposed a unique method to relate the flashover voltage to the types of salts present. Although the distribution of contaminants on the surface plays a significant role in the flashover, it was found that no one portion of the insulator tends to predominate in importance and the uniform contamination distribution yields the minimum flashover voltage."
"The effects of modeling non-transposition and the frequency dependence of the earth return on switching surges caused by high speed reclosing operations are studied. Theoretical and experimental results are in close agreement. Comparisons are based on the probability density distribution of overvoltages and the consequences of the different modeling techniques are illustrated with a simple line design example."
"The cause of fires in vertical pole members of wooden high voltage transmission line towers not attributable to surface leakage currents or lightning stroke has been identified as a result of excessive internal Joule losses generated within the pole wood. These Joule losses are a consequence of the electrical conductivity of high moisture content wood and charging currents resulting from the capacitive coupling existing between the poles and the phase wires and high electric field intensities. Suggested cures for the problem include the use of increased numbers of metal fasteners holding the grounding wires to the Poles to more uniformly transfer the charging current from the pole to the grounding network."
"A method of measuring the temperature rise of the rotor of a large (500MW) generator is described in this paper. The method makes use of a direct current comparator, which enables accurate measurements to be made from a few percent up to beyond 100 percent of rated field current. The measurements were made while the generator was being used under various conditions of load and cooling."
"The design and test results of a digital automatic voltage regulator are described in the paper. The basic control unit is a mini-computer supported by a digital hardware interface, signal transducers and a teletype. The flexibility of the digital AVR software has been exhibited in both open-circuit and synchronized tests. Digital AVR operation has been categorized into two modes, i.e., normal and special. Observations made from various tests allow guidelines to be laid as to the best possible manner in which to operate the digital AVR. A large number of features and control options have been incorporated into the design and have proven very useful in determining the best approach to be taken in digital control of a generating unit."
"The parameters determining the response of phase-to-phase insulation are the amplitudes Vn(negative) and Vp(positive) of the two voltage components to the ground, their shape and the relative displacement Δt of their crests. In the present paper, the effects of Δt and of the ratio α = Vn/(Vn+ Vp) on the virtual total breakdown voltage Vn+ Vpare investigated. An attempt is made to derive an analytical expression for the combined effect of α, Δt and the polarity of the two components. Recommendations are offered as to the required geometrical arrangement for performing phase-to-phase tests as well as to the presentation of their results."
"Optimization of the air insulation of high voltage systems is obtained by studying the overall behavior of the combined gap formed by phase-to-phase (Ph-Ph) and phase-to-ground (Ph-G) clearances. The coordination between Ph-Ph and Ph-G gaps is investigated both experimentally and statistically for a given electrode arrangement. The transition from Ph-Ph to Ph-G breakdown, following a gradual increase of the Ph-Ph clearance (with a fixed Ph-G clearance), is expressed by charts of relative probabilities and is related to the parameter α = Vn/(Vn+ Vp). Recommendations are offered to help select the Ph-Ph clearance which, combined with the Ph-G clearance of the system, gives a predetermined total breakdown probability for the combined gap as well as predetermined relative Ph-Ph and Ph-G breakdown probabilities."
"A theoretical study of water tree mechanism is described. Microscopic analyses (1),(2) of water trees revealed that they are composed of many water-filled micro-voids which are less than several microns in diameter. The mechanism of the void generation is explained by the thermo-dynamics in which the electric field is considered. Based on this mechanism, the growth of water tree is explained in respect of the effect of frequency, temperature and electric field strength. This corresponds well with the results of experiments made by many researchers. Also given are the characteristics of the start points of the tree and cable containing water tree."
"A general solution for the earth-return impedance of overhead transmission lines in the multi-layer case is developed in the paper. The solution derived permits the earth-return path to be considered as several layers of differing resistivities, permittivities and permeabilities. In particular, the results are extended to cover a discrete approximation of continuously variable formations is illustrated with examples of exponential and linear variations of earth resistivity."
"A method of designing a linear, optimal, constant, feedback control system based on quantities easily measurable at the synchronous generator location is presented for power system equipped with fast-acting excitation systems. The method is applied to a single-machine infinite-bus system, and the performance of the system to large disturbances, created by applying three phase faults, is studied. To permit meaningful comparisons between the proposed control scheme and conventionally used schemes, the performance of an 'optimized' supplementary excitation control system is used as a base against which to judge the relative merits of the new scheme. It is found that the proposed control system design, when evaluated over a wide operating range, consistently results in improvements in system behaviour as compared to the conventional control system. To improve system reliability, the optimal control system design is carried out without assuming that the supplementary stabilizer is disconnected. Thus if, for any reason, the new control is not available, the system still has the benefit of stabilizing action provided by the supplementary stabilizer."
"The nuclear power plants of today require some form of process heating to keep various process fluids moving in their associated systems and thus render the plants operational. Such applications of process heating include the following: 1) heating to prevent borated water from dropping below its crystalization temperature, 2) heating to prevent caustic solutions from dropping below their crystalization temperatures, and 3) heating to prevent outdoor service water systems from freezing during cold weather (if applicable). At Duke Power Company mineral insulated (MI) electric trace heating systems are being used in all of the above listed applications. It is felt that the use of MI electric trace heating systems will be beneficial due to their durability, long life, and relatively maintenance free operation."
"With the development of EHV transmission systems, research was necessary to measure the amounts of ozone which could potentially emanate from the corona discharges of EHV transmission lines under dry conditions and in the presence of light or heavy rain. The paper reviews experiments performed in two high voltage laboratories. Three cages and seven conductors (solid and stranded, single and bundle arrangements) were used for dry and wet experiments. About 1300 test points were obtained, encompassing a wide range of voltage gradient and corona loss values. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Measuring equipment and experience are discussed. Investigations show that the overall average ratio of corona loss to ozone production was about 0.52 kWh/g of 03(235 kWh/lb of 03), based on all of the experiments. Long-term field tests were conducted and an experimental measurement program extending several months before and after energization of a 765-kV line was carried out. All of the laboratory and field examinations confirmed that the ozone levels and production rates within the actual operating voltage gradient and corona loss region were very low, and the ground level ozone concentrations due to EHV transmission line corona were indistinguishable from ambient ozone concentrations."
"A new method is presented suitable for measuring extremely high local heat fluxes on surfaces. The method is applied for measuring peak anode heat fluxes in 5 kA pulsed arcs using nitrogen and argon at 1 atm. as working gases and tungsten, molybdenum, copper, and titanium as anode materials. The electrode geometry for the reported data consists of a pointed (60° included angle) tungsten cathode positioned approximately 1 cm above a planar anode. The anode heat flux is deduced from the temperature history of the rear face of very thin anodes. Temperature measurements with sufficiently rapid response and noise insensitivity are accomplished with a calibrated light fiber-photomultiplier arrangement. The results show that the cathode jet and the working gas may have a strong influence on peak anode heat fluxes which are in the order of 100kW/cm2."
"The influence of the prestrike phenomena in a circuit breaker has been investigated. It is shown that due to prestrike the closing instants of a circuit breaker will have a non-uniform statistical distribution and that the influence on the peak overvoltage distribution is significant. The voltage-drop across the circuit breaker in the prestrike period has been considered and a better agreement between field test oscillograms and calculated transients is obtained when this voltage-drop is accounted for."
"Data on the dynamic stress-strain characteristics of transformer pressboard during transient loading like that occurring in power transformer coils during short circuits are presented for wide ranges of preload stress, peak stress, and temperature. A nine-element dynamic stiffness and damping representation for pressboard is described which is based on these measured results and the physical nature of oil-immersed pressboard. It is shown that the representation accurately duplicates the highly nonlinear dynamic stress-strain characteristics of pressboard over wide ranges of conditions and provides a means for reliably calculating the large transient forces and displacements that can cause failure of transformer coils during short circuits."
"This paper describes a mathematical model for the simulation of an AC/DC system using direct-phase quantities. This system consists of an AC/DC converter station connected to a synchronous generator at its terminals as well as to an infinite bus-bar through a short transmission line. The proposed model in direct-phase quantities enables the study of the effects of the generated harmonics of the DC transmission on AC systems in general and on the behavior of synchronous machines in particular. The paper describes also a numerical solution using a digital computer for the mathematical model of this AC/DC system. The usefulness and versatility of the computer program are demonstrated by applying it to different AC/DC system configurations. The paper gives results of some studies concerning the effects of the generated harmonics on the behavior of synchronous machines with or without filters in the system."

"This paper describes a novel electronic scheme for speed control of an induction motor driving a pump or fan. The low-slip motor used in the test program was given a flat torque-speed curve and a low starting current by locating bars of Alnico 9, which has a large hysteresis loop, in the rotor leakage flux paths. Motor voltage and, therefore, motor speed was varied by delayed firing of SCRs, or thyristors, which were connected full wave delta in the neutral of the wye-connected stator winding. The control loop uses an analog signal to hold a desired speed, or torque, or power."
"The standard methods for determining the earth return impedance of a transmission line when the ground is stratified are cumbersome and involve lengthy numerical integration procedures.

"The costs derived from installing, operating, and maintaining the transmission and distribution system have historically comprised about 2/3 the total costs of producing and delivering electricity to residential-commercial customers, and over 1/3 the total costs of supplying electricity to large industrial customers. This paper estimates the costs of transmission and distribution for nine regions of the United States for the above two customer classes. These costs are detailed for six categories of equipment used in the transmission and distribution system and the contribution to the total cost of each equipment category is determined."
"The increasing demand for development of alternate energy sources brought about accelerated studies and development of solar electrical systems. One of the main components in such systems is the solar cell array, based mostly on silicon cells. The solar cell array converts the solar radiation energy into electric energy, and thus the energy output is a function of the radiation levels. Therefore, in order to judge the usefulness of a solar electrical system, accurate climatological data is required. Acquiring such data is a difficult problem and expensive devices are needed. In this paper a new method for acquiring the climatological data needed for the above-mentioned purposes is described. This method is simple in its character and the equipment developed is much cheaper. Field tests, which were carried out here in Israel, proved that the measuring system developed is reliable, gives accurate data, and is maintenance-free."
"This paper presents the development and application of the receding horizon method to the design of state feedback controllers for synchronous machines. The proposed technique does not require to specify a-priori the weighting matrix Q of the usual quadratic cost function. It requires, however, the integration of a Riccati-type equation over a given time interval T. The design method is employed to determine the excitation control strategies of single synchronous machines connected to an infinite bus."
"A new excitation system has been developed employing a power source which is an integral part of the generator. Excitation power originates from the generator air-gap flux and from the generator stator winding currents. The physical arrangement of the excitation power source components provides compactness to this self-excited, essentially self-regulated and high initial response system. It facilitates generator maintenance, by eliminating rotating parts from the collector end of the turbine-generator shaft, and simplifies the station layout. The ac excitation power is rectified by means of a full-wave bridge with silicon diodes and shunt silicon controlled rectifiers (thyristors). Extensive use of static components is made in the generator voltage control system coupled with redundant features which permit maintenance during operation."
"For a parallel ac-dc power system, the effect of a controlled dc link on system stability and damping depends on the system operating conditions.Thus a controller which improves stability at one operating condition may have a detrimental effect at other system operating conditions. Further, when the machine power angle to the ac line angle is high, improvement in stability is difficult to obtain solely by the control of a d.c. link. The variation with operating conditions of the influence of a dc link control on system performance indicates that a predictive or adaptive control mode would be needed to improve system stability over a wide range of system performance. The paper, therefore, examines both the conventionaI and optimal control of the link for large disturbance performance of a parallel ac-dc power system and digital simulation results show interesting features of optimal control. From a practical implementation point of view, full state optimal feedback law is suitably modified to be a linear combination of reduced state variables by an eigenvalue grouping technique and the performance of the actual nonlinear system with the suboptimal controller is quite encouraging."
"As part of a study to evaluate the feasibility of uprating existing 15 kV spacer-cable systems to 34.5 kV, a method was developed for predicting the life of the polyethylene cable which may be eroded by electrical surface discharges in wet weather. The prediction method considers the changes in spacer surface resistance and the resulting electrical stress on the polyethylene throughout a typical year of varied surface conductivity during rain and fog, together with a measure of the quantity (Q) of surface discharges per power frequency cycle, which is related to the electrical stress. It is believed that the measurements and procedure outlined form a reasonable basis for predicting polyethylene spacer-cable life in wet weather, and for large value surface discharges the life appears to be inversely proportional to the initial Q2."
"A fast-acting HVDC Circuit Breaker was tested on the Pacific HVDC Intertie System. The Intertie was operated as a three-terminal system with the breaker located on one branch. Intentional faults were applied close to the breaker and 250 miles away and successfully cleared. In load-break tests the breaker disconnected one branch of the system without problems."

Table II gives project rating and nominal head, and the data is preliminary."
"The studies undertaken by the Task Force addressed the definition and collection of data for common mode outages of multiple transmission lines which are on the same right-of-way for a measurable part of their length. A line-originated common mode outage is defined as an overlapping outage of two or more circuits sharing a right-of-way, from a common event, and due to their proximity on the right-of-way. A preliminary investigation of the available data shows that common mode outage events could be significant in transmission reliability calculations and that most of the data collection procedures are inadequate to provide data needed to evaluate these events. The additional information required to calculate indices of common mode outages is suggested in this paper. A method of calculating these indices is also illustrated."
"The evolution of hot washing insulators with deionized water is reviewed and the most recent washing equipment and practices are described. The effect of increasing the effective washing distance through the use of \"slick water\" and the safety of this practice are investigated. The safety of using deionized water for hot washing insulators within the confined work area of low profile substations is investigated and Southern California Edison Company's minimum safe washing distances are reduced."
"The increased search for alternative energy sources has lead to renewed interest and studies of large wind-driven generators. This paper presents the results and considerations of such an investigation. The paper emphasizes the concept selection of wind-driven generators, system optimization, control system design, safety aspects, economic viability on electric utility systems and potential electric system interfacing problems."
"Overheating problems within turbine generators if undetected can lead to catastrophic failures associated with long and costly outages. Instrumental chemical analysis methods used to detect and diagnose these hot spots are described. The Core Monitor, gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer have been applied to the analysis of the generator hydrogen coolant. By determining the concentration and type of organic thermal decomposition products in the hydrogen, the extent and possible location of the problem can be diagnosed."
"The design details of a 3-MVA, 2-pole superconducting generator, developed as part of a program sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute were reported in the literature early in 1973. The goal of this program is to demonstrate the features of superconducting generators that are applicable to very large machines, on a prototype of modest size. This paper reports the results of a series of tests performed on this generator."
"In this paper, the possible means to reduce HVDC converter station land area requirements are shown. The split-up of real estate between the different kinds of equipment in present-day terminals is analysed. From this, a priority list for suitable action to be taken is deducted. Three concepts of converter valves suitable for compact converter stations are briefly discussed. By example of a 2400 MW terminal it is shown that with air-insulated liquid cooled thyristor valves a land area requirement of 0.8 m2/MW (8.5 sq. ft./MW) can be achieved, i.e. 1. 2 % of that required by the Pacific Intertie. Alternative solutions with metalclad valves are introduced and it is concluded that for converter stations with high rating in metropolitan areas, air-insulated liquid cooled thyristor valves seem to be the most appropriate choice. Where a low profile station is desirable, dead tank oil-insulated thyristor valves for outdoor mounting could be the optimum solution."
"A new control center for energy generation, transmission and distribution (both gas and electric) at Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company improves operator control of the systems and eliminates most manual record-keeping. The system uses two Xerox Sigma 5 computers, each with an effective memory of 96,000 words and back-up stored memory of 12 million bytes. Using analog and digital inputs supplied by Westinghouse REDAC remote processors, the system permits automatic response to many system changes, displays information to permit operator action, and effectively cuts response time even when operator intervention is necessary. On-line graphic and alphanumeric displays provide overviews of the total system or detailed studies of system segments, as necessary. All energy management accounting systems, including off-line analysis, record-keeping and reporting functions, are performed automatically."

"Because of the squared relationship between the flux and braking torque of the retarding magnet of the watthour meter, and the need to maintain high meter accuracy under all operating conditions over long periods of time, stability of the magnet is essential. Over the years, this stability and the resistance to demagnetization by extraneous magnetic fields or short-circuit currents have increased with each new material development applied to the retarding system of the meter. A continuation of this series of improvements is currently taking place with the introduction of rare earth magnets."
"This paper presents a simplified yet practical method to be used for quick evaluation of the reliabilities of hierarchical power control systems consisting of control computers, a variety of regulating devices and human operators interconnected by communication networks. The quantity \"percent loss of information\" is defined and used as a measure to evaluate the overall reliabilities of hierarchical computer control complexes. The proposed method is tested for a simple control system and the result checked against the Monte Carlo approach. It is then applied to 2- and 3-level hierarchical power control system models. Further applications of the method such as the design of component redundancies are also discussed."
"An induction machine model in which the order of the electrical differential equations is one half of the conventional real variable model is obtained by using the complex time variables introduced by Ku and Lyon in the 1950's. Since the stepped excitation waveforms associated with polyphase inverters are also well suited to complex representation, the method provides a powerful means of exploiting the symmetry inherent in inverter-machine systems. After a brief introduction to the concept of complex time variables, the steady state analysis of six-step voltage and current source inverter driven induction machines is presented. Closed form solutions for the instantaneous voltages, currents and torques are derived. For small slip the current fed machine solutions are reduced to simple expressions involving rotor frequency sinusoidal functions and the relationships between these waveforms and the fundamental component equivalent circuit solutions are demonstrated. The solutions for the voltage fed machine are more complicated, however, hand computation of peak values is feasible or extremely simple computer programs can be written to yield the instantaneous current and torque waveforms."
"The electromechanical stiffness and damping coefficient matrices for three translational degrees of freedom are derived for the repulsive levitation system consisting of a single superconducting magnet interacting with a finite width sheet guideway. The persistent node (constant flux linkage) is assumed. The results of this study provide the data for stability and ride quality analysis. The methodology can be extended to multi-magnet systems including active damping coils."
"This paper describes the results of work accomplished in developing low cost, high efficiency dc to ac power conversion equipment for fuel cell powerplants to be used in two different commercial applications. The first is for on-site power generation in the range of 10 to 500 kW and the second is for dispersed electric utility power generation in substations at a 26 MW power level. Performance data is presented on single-phase and three-phase prototype inverters in the first category. Work currently in progress on the 26 MW inverter is described including operational tests on a 500 kW unit delivering power into the lines of the Connecticut Light and Power Company. To accomplish the desired results, fast switching thyristors with low forward drop and high dv/dt are used."
"Optimal output controllers for high-speed excitation systems of synchronous machines, using constant and/or dynamic feedback gains, are discussed in this paper. A general problem formulation and solution are presented. A number of combinations of measurable output variables are used for control. Also, several random characteristics of the system initial state are used in the incomplete output feedback controllers' design. Effectiveness of the stabilizers are tested subjecting the system to a small input disturbance and a three-phase-to-ground fault."
"In this paper, a reduced order model of an induction machine, developed in reference [1] is investigated using digital simulation and eigenvalue studies. The model is compared with the complete representation by simulating the non-linear equations of both for the same dynamic situation. This study includes the transient load modeling of a single machine and the performance of the model in the case of interconnected machines. It is observed that the results obtained using the simplified model compare well with those obtained using the complete model and that significant saving in computation time results for the case of interconnected machines. Also a linearized version of the model is used for stability studies using eigenvalue analysis. Here again, the stability for small perturbations of a single machine and a system of interconnected machines is investigated using the reduced order and complete models. The reduced order model is found to give only approximate results regarding stability in a limited range of operating conditions. It appears that the reduced order model, if used in its non-linear form would be effective in transient stability studies of large-scale systems."
"This paper discusses recent research conducted at two major Soviet open-cycle MHD facilities-the U-02 experimental installation and the U-25 pilot plant. The role of open-cycle MHD in the fuel-and-energy balance of the USSR is also reviewed."
"In a previous paper the hypothesis was expressed, that wet fluffy snow-flakes do increase the \"macroscopic\" permittivity of the space, thus increasing conductor charges and potential gradients. A subsequent paper consolidated this hypothesis on the base of model tests and calculations. The present paper describes the results of field tests confirming the above mentioned theory. The capacitance between two parallel grids increases during snow-storms at temperatures around the freezing point (favorable for the formation of heavy snow-flakes)."
"A dedicated minicomputer is used to record transducer signals during high power interruption testing of circuit breakers. Special interface circuits employing optical coupling and low capacitance shielding techniques buffer the computer aginst the typically high electrical fields. A computer gives the recording system the ability to handle digital signals and apply software processing to the data. This provides the design engineer with a printed report of the analyzed data after each power test."
"Conventional supply of d.c. motors is effected at constant voltage, and their behavior under these conditions is familiar. For still unsolved problems of starting, speed regulation and braking, this paper proposes a solution based on constant-current supply. The resulting behavior was analyzed for series-external and parallel-excitation respectively, with saturation of the magnetic circuit and the properties of the stabilized current supply taken into account. The experimental torque characteristics obtained in the course of the study indicate certain advantages of the stabilized-current starting and operation."
"This paper deals with the synchronous dips in the torque-speed characteristic of a shaded pole hysteresis motor. The case under consideration is that of the synchronous dip related to the third harmonic of the air-gap field. First we show that the torque Varies between a maximum and a minimum value when the motor runs at one third of synchronous speed and we relate the torque values to the (B,H) characteristics of the rotor ring. Then, we calculate the rotor fields from the supply voltage and current of the motor. At the end we compare the experimental and theoretical values of the torques for different supply voltages at one third of synchronous speed."

"An improved method is suggested for calculating and correlating the burst pulse and streamer onset voltages of a positive rod-plane gap in air. The computed results indicate that the positive corona in rod-plane gaps always starts with burst pulses in agreement with experiment. The conditions of burst pulse-streamer and burst pulse-glow transitions are also discussed. It is found -for the first time-that the photoelectron distribution within the ionization zone, which depends upon the gap geometry, plays an important role in deciding the discharge development from burst pulses."
"The problem of estimating the increase in computational effort as the system size n increases is studied for methods requiring the solution of Ax = b, where A is sparse and topology-symmetric. The expected value of the total number of upper triangular nonzero elements after factorization is assumed to grow as n1+γ. The expected computational effort for the factorization itself is shown to grow as n1+2γ, while the one for each repeat solution is shown to grow as n1+γ. Values of γ for typical power systems are experimentally determined by generating a variety of random networks and ordering the resultant matrices according to \"scheme 2\". For typical power systems a reasonable value for γ is 0.2. Therefore, methods requiring repeated refactorization of A (such as Newton's method) can be expected to increase as n1.4, while methods requiring merely repeat solutions (such as fast decoupled methods) can be expected to increase as n1.2. Several other important comparisons are included."
"A brief review of large bulb unit development in France since 1957 is followed by a detailed description of the Rance tidal power plant and a summary of other French bulb unit plants, mainly located on the Rhone and Rhine Rivers.

The report ends with an appraisal of the main advantages and drawbacks of bulb units compared to conventional Kaplans, and a few words on future development."
"The elastic behavior of laminated rotor rims is discussed, in order to illustrate the premises from which rigorous methods may be developed for determining the stresses on rotor rims main components i.e. steel plates and bolts. The article basically deals with the most classic amongst the various piling patterns used in construction of hydrogenerators."

"This paper presents and discusses results from a computer simulation of a battery energy storage/converter system connected to a representative utility substation. Switching of load, voltage waveforms, voltage levels, fault conditions, and power flow reversal are investigated for both line- and forced-cornmutated converters in the application. The interactions among the battery, the converter and its controls, and the substation are discussed. The investigations have pointed out areas in which further consideration must be given to component selection for the battery/utility interface equipment, for example, dc reactor sizing, harmonic filtering, power factor control, thyristor firing control, and dc current interruption."
"This paper describes investigations on the influence of surface roughness on the onset or breakdown voltage in air and SF6. Applying the streamer theorie of electrical discharges the role of ionization characteristic, gas pressure, shape and size of electrode surface protrusions is discussed. The maximum allowable field gradients of electrode surfaces with hemispherical, spherical, and filamentary irregularities were computed in air and SF6. Pictures of a sparked electrode surface, showing slze and shape of surface roughness, were made using an electron scanning microscope. A comparison between computed breakdown field gradients of rough electrodes and experimental results obtained by employing different electrode configurations in a wide pressure range confirmed the theoretical considerations."
"In ensuring nuclear safety by the utmost reliable supply of power to all safety related systems under all emergency conditions, U.S. power plants rely heavily on redundant offsite power sources. For years German plant designers have been and are still placing a greater emphasis on onsite power sources in the form of highly redundant sophisticated Diesel generating sets. This difference in fundamental design philosophy and the concepts underlying the Diesel power systems incorporated into German nuclear stations are discussed."
"This paper presents a method for determining the design parameters for an electric transmission line system. A mathematical model is formulated using regression analysis to relate system costs and requirements to the system design parameters. In general, this mathematical model is both nonlinear and nonconvex. Solutions obtained for a specific problem using a nonlinear programming computer code are presented. Although the results are applicable only to this specific problem, the method of analysis is applicable to the general transmission line design problem."
"Manitoba Hydro's Kettle Generating Station, situated on the Nelson River in northern Manitoba, is an isolated hydro-electric plant supplying power directly to Radisson HVDC rectifier station. Some characteristics of this transmission system require the control systems to have special features to ensure successful operation of the generating station.

"A three-phase ultra-high voltage transmission test line at EPRI's Project UHV was energized in January 1975. Analyses of the audible noise performance of the first six-months of energization are presented. The result of long-term energization during foul-weather are reported in terms of cumulative frequency distributions, lateral profiles and frequency spectra. Audible noise variations with voltage in rain and fair weather are also presented. Results are compared with calculations made on the basis of single-phase tests. Good agreement between measured and calculated performances is demonstrated."
"The KATIZA model is designed with the aim of optimizing investments in electric generation equipment. It is based on: - management simulation supplying the annual operating and failure costs of any prospective optimum structure of a generation system, - investment optimization permitting determination of an optimal strategy for the equipment of a production system over a given time period. The model carries out a schematization of reality by means of hypotheses that narrow down the field of application and make it more specific for certain types of problems. A special application of the KATIZA model makes it possible to assess the relative importance of the uncertainties of consumption and of thermal and hydraulic availability in determining the optimal size of an electric generation system."
"This paper contains various technical and economic comparisons of long distance EHV AC and DC transmission expansion plans for remote generation plants. The future Kaiparowits coal-fired plant located in Southern Utah is used as the case study to evaluate dynamic system performance, subsynchronous resonance, economics, and transmission system reliability. The reliability analysis outlines a comparison of AC versus DC transmission system reliability and quantifies the results in terms of economics. Because of the difficulties involved with the comparison of transmission alternatives from a reliability standpoint-especially when comparing AC and DC alternatives, a conventional generation resource reliability program has been applied in a new manner to quantitatively assess transmission reliability. This is a departure from standard transmission planning practice and is the basic significance of this paper."
"This work concerns an analog computer simulation of full-wave controlled rectifier bridges, which are fundamental for any conversion of alternating current to direct current. The control of rectifier bridges is realized with the aid of logical components. In spite of the comparative simplicity of the power scheme, the transitional processes in converters can be complicated, particularly when the converter is operated abnormally. The simulation of rectifier bridges presents some difficulty when using a potentially unstable model. Usually instability of a model occurs because of the presence of closed loop circuits which have an even number of amplifiers or because of inaccurate mathematical descriptions of the real system. Practically until recently there have been no universal analog computer diagrams to study the electromagnetical processes in converter bridges under stationary, transitional and emergency conditions of the rectifier bridge. A method akin to that used in servosystems is used for the simulation of the rectifier bridges. Only one analog computer diagram is obtained and it gives stable solutions for any condition of the bridge. The accuracy of the simulation was determined by comparing the computer outputs to recordings taken from an actual system used in The Institute of Machine Construction, Zaporozhje, U.S.S.R. The simulation resulted in good correlation between computer solutions and experimental data for a wide set of problems in the area of energy conversion systems."
"Humidity influences the breakdown characteristics of air gaps by its effect on the predischarge phenomena. For an understanding sufficient to answer engineering problems details of physical events must be known, which can be explained by the use of advanced measuring techniques. The results found in this way are applicable also to air gaps with great distances."
"The results of studies performed for the verification and parameter identification of a low-rder boiler model from actual operating data are presented. The model chosen for identification and verification is a linear fourth order system with eight unknown parameters and two inputs and two outputs. The model is intended for use in stability studies over the time interval of approximately one-half minute to a few minutes following a disturbance."
"This paper reviews the proposal submitted by the IEEE Working Group for the Revisions of Dielectric Test Standards for Power Transformers and the technical aspects of stress-time endurance (life), particularly its rate as affected by field divergence, gassing stress, and discharge inception and extinction levels. A comparison of the effects of test stresses on insulation endurance is made, accompanied by a recommendation regarding future proposals for changes in test procedures."
"An axially blown arc is studied under physical conditions typical of HV circuit breakers. The experiment is especially designed to produce a stable and reproducible arc with good accessability for diagnostics. After a stationary phase the current is ramped down with adjustable slope. The vicinity of current zero is especially investigated. For the first time, the most effective recovery zone is localized and its physical parameters are evaluated. The limiting curve for thermal reignition is determined. Based on the observed phenomena a theoretical description is derived which explains quite well the experimentally known extinction characteristics of this type of arc."
"The first eight hydroelectric generating stations built by TVA were staffed with both electrical operators and hydraulic operators and operating costs were high. After successful operation of two single unit plants via supervisory control, it was decided for economic reasons that new plants would be either supervisory controlled or certain features would be provided so only electrical operators would be required. Also existing stations were to be converted to one of these types of control. As a result, TVA now has 4 plants which were converted to supervisory control, 8 plants built equipped for supervisory control, 2 plants built to require only electrical operators, and 13 plants which were modified to eliminate the need for hydraulic operators. After many years of successful operation of these control systems, design work has now begun, in the interest of system efficiency and economy, on system-wide supervisory control from five area dispatch control centers. Initially, four existing hydro plants and a new pumped-storage plant will be incorporated into this control system."
"A novel HVDC circuit breaker is described which utilizes crossed-field interrupters in a sequential switching mode. The breaker and its components were tested in an inductive energy storage facility at levels of 1000 A, 100 kV and performed satisfactorily."

Descriptions such as design and operating characteristics, type, application, etc. which can be used to classify or group components in analyzing outage data are also suggested. The important requirements of an outage reporting procedure are discussed in this report. The information in this paper can be used as a guide by the utility industry in setting up a standard transmission and distribution equipment data bank."
"Electric power systems with much higher voltages and larger generating capacity continue to require increased reliability of protective schemes; therefore, a new look is required. This paper presents a workable method for protecting wire line communications facilities entering electric power stations. In the case of leased facilities, a mutually agreeable method for protective equipment to be installed by either party is presented. The protection method to be described is based on the isolation concept and is a combination of existing and improved techniques, made possible by the availability of new equipment and cable with improved dielectric capabilities."
"Results of theoretical and experimental studies of liquid metal current collectors, primarily for segmented-magnet (SEGMAG) drum-type homopolar generators, are presented. Current collectors evaluated are of the rotating disk-stationary concentric channel design The liquid metal is the eutectic sodium-potassium alloy (NaK-78). Power losses and disturbing pressures in the liquid metal were either analyzed or evaluated experimentally in terms of rotor speed, temperature, electric current, and magnetic field for prototypic size current collectors. Specific-contact resistance measurements made using these collectors are reported here."
"Based on the Diakoptic Equation, an algorithm is developed for block diagonalizing and solving any given set of linear simultaneous equations. This algorithm is then applied to block diagonalize and solve the Jacobian matrix and hence the load flow problem. The algorithm is perfectly general and can be appliedto any set of linear simultaneous equations, symmetrical or asymmetrical and hence can be applied to other fields as well. Applied to the load flow problem, it requires to consider a few more additional right hand side vectors to the Jacobian, and further an inter-subdivision matrix is to be formed and solved. No matrix inversion is required in this method and hence sparsity can be exploited to the maximum extent. Practical steps are given, so that the algorithm can be implimented by others."
"As part of the Radio Interference (RI) meter-comparison tests at the AEP-Westinghouse Apple Grove 775 kV Project in Apple Grove West Virginia, October 1974, Amplitude Probability Distribution (APD) measurements were made of the wet and dry conductor corona and gap radio noise processes. This paper describes the equipment and methods used for the measurements. From the APD data it is shown that values for the Vrms, Vaverageand Vdnoise parameters may be calculated and that these agree favourably with the values of the same parameters measured on meters having the same bandwidths. Finally it is shown that from values of the Vrmsand Vdnoise parameters it is possible to predict the APD with good results by using the CCIR and Log-Normal noise models previously developed for atmospheric noise."
"A new method for the design of EHV dividers is presented, which not only permits the calculation of their optimum geometry but also gives the divider response time. The electric field distribution around the divider is calculated using a new computer program based on a charge simulation technique. The response time is then derived from the distribution of the normal component of the field along the divider resistive elements. The method presented has been applied to the design of a 2.5 MV resistive divider and the calculated response time as well as the corona onset voltage level agree with the measured ones. The relation between the divider linearity with voltage and the maximum field gradients is discussed and certain values of this design parameter are proposed."
"An experimental program involving small turn segment models demonstrated the inter-related effects of thermal aging and mechanical stressing on the integrity of transformer conductor insulation. The experimental data was used to develop mathematical relationships between insulation wear life and the thermal and mechanical parameters which influence it. While modeling limitations preclude the use of these relationships for absolute life predictions without further correlating experiments on larger transformer-like structures, the relationships can be applied on a relative basis to answer questions about loading guides and practices and about effects of different magnitudes and numbers of short-circults. Examples of such applications have been given and discussed."
"The Pacific Intertie HVDC System has been operated in a voltage-limited three terminal configuration suitable for dc circuit breaker testing. A rectifier at Celilo, Oregon, delivered power down-line 847 miles to a current-controlling inverter at Sylmar, California. Part of the rectifier current was taken by that inverter and returned to Celilo via the ground path. The remainder of the rectifier current returned to a current-controlling inverter at Celilo along the other pole. The system approximated a 1694 mile tapped monopolar line having an inverter at the midpoint. Changes in system configuration, control, and protection are described. Results of close-in and remote fault tests are compared against computer transient simulations. The system operated essentially as predicted and as such, this modification of an existing bipolar dc system has made possible the means to make a meaningful field test of a dc circuit breaker."

"This paper provides an application procedure and graphs for the design of the shielding of high-voltage and extra-high-voltage substations, where negative shielding angle configurations are usually encountered. It covers the shielding by both ground wires and masts. The method employed is an extension of Gilman-Whitehead electrogeometric model."
"A synthetic test installation using voltage injection and medium voltage off-communication schemes has been constructed to conduct dynamic performance testing on vacuum interrupters. The test circuit in its present setup is capable of simulating variable forward currents up to 10kA, conduction time of interrupters in vacuum-arc made up to approximately 15ms, di/dt up to 100A/µs and recovery voltages in the forward direction up to 120kV. The deionization margin can be varied practically from 0 to a few milliseconds and the dv/dt range extends up to approximately 15 kV/µs. The simulated stress corresponds to the duty the vacuum interrupters would experience during their operation as (1) an off-switch in inductive energy storage circuits and (2) an hvdc circuit breaker. It is planned to extend the scope of testing by increasing the current capability from 10kA to 20 kA at a later date. If necessary, arrangements will also be made in the future to be able to optionally change the output polarity of the high voltage supply, HVS which is at present a modified 6 stage Marx-Bank. This will enable us to test vacuum interrupters also with inverse recovery voltages. The major design considerations and the operating characteristics of the test installation are discussed."
"A practical digital computer method for obtaining eigenvalue sensitivities of interconnected power systems is presented. The method is especially suited to the analysis of detailed modelled synchronous machine systems where shaft and stator-network dynamic effects are significant. A unified structure in the construction of the state space equations permits the inclusion of a wide variety of control equipment and varying degrees of modelling complexity. Sample results are given for typical cases illustrating the significance of eigenvalue sensitivities. Specifically results are presented for a 4 generator hydroelectric system and for a 2 generator system exibiting subsynchronous torsional resonance."
"The symmetry of the induction machine can be exploited to obtain general closed form expressions for the small signal transfer functions describing speed, voltage, frequency, or load perturbations by utilizing the complex time variables introduced by Ku and Lyon in the 1950's. After a brief introduction to complex variables, the linearlzed complex variable equations describing small signal dynamic performance are presented. These equations are used to obtain transfer functions in which the effects of excitation level are isolated in the gain factors. The speed and frequency dependence of the poles and zeros is expressed in closed form employing a useful non-dimensional parameter system. To illustrate the application of these results, the dynamic behavior of the induction machine without feed-back control is analyzed. It is shown that the general dynamic response can be characterized by the non-dimensional loop gain and stator frequency. A set of general non-dimensional root loci are presented which permit rapid estimation of the relative stability (dominant eigenvalues) and the frequency of minimum damping of any specific machine. The application of the transfer functions to cases involving feedback control of the machine is also discussed."
"Fuel cost savings can be obtained by proper commitment of the available generating units. This paper describes a truncated dynamic programming method for the commitment of thermal units over a period of up to 48 hours. The commitment is such that the total cost is minimal. The total cost includes both the production cost and costs associated with the startup and shutdown of units. The startup cost for each unit is dependent on the amount of time the unit has been shutdown prior to startup. A variety of spinning reserve requirements are observed and crew constraints on the startup and/or shutdown of two or more units in the same plant are imposed on some of the plants. In addition, operation of individual units must satisfy the specified minimum up times and minimum shutdown times."
"It is shown, particulary for shaded pole induction motors, that saturation is an important factor, and that it varies widely when slip varies from 0 to 1. The method proposed here is completely different from the former ones; it is a step by step method; all the currents and fields are détermined at each time of an half cycle. Tests and computation results are given and compared."
"This paper presents the results of full scale transmission line foundation tests performed in Brazil. The tests were performed to verify the methods used for determining soil properties for possible modification of the types and basic design parameters of grillage foundations and to investigate concrete cylinder foundations with a view to their possible use as a substitute for grillages."
"Outdoor rigid bus design is based on several limiting criteria. This paper brings to a single source the thermal considerations of rigid bus design namely, transfer of heat and properties of material. It concerns itself with aluminum alloys, copper and copper alloys and the currently acceptable shapes. Historically thermal designs have been conservative. This paper will allow the engineer to re-examine the factors involved in increased current loadings of rigid bus and possibly determine new thermal limits."
"This paper deals with the dynamic performance of reluctance motors with axially laminated magnetically anisotropic rotors. Superior performance of these motors over conventional reluctance and sgemental motors in performance like power factor, efficiency, pull out and pull in torques is established. In the present paper, a detailed study of the dynamic performance is undertaken. Equations for dynamic performance are established as well as a solution to the equations using computers."
"Wake-induced oscillations of bundled conductors are caused by shielding of leward conductors of a bundle by windward ones. The conductor motions take the form of traveling vibration waves moving in the bundle. Analysis is carried out in terms of normal wave propagation modes, each mode being a certain combination of wave motions in the conductors of the bundle that propagates independently of the other modes. The transfer matrix method is used to determine whether a set of propagation modes exists, for given wind conditions, that can satisfy boundary conditions at span supports and thus indicate the possibility of stable oscillation."
"The paper deals with a laboratory investigation into the influence of rain on the switching impulse sparkover characteristics of large-sphere and toroid plane air gaps. Tests were also carried out on coneterminated rod-plane gaps for reference purposes. The factors investigated include the high voltage electrode geometry, nature of the surface, rain intensity as well as the impulse form and polarity. Attention is also paid to the influence of rain on the statistical dispersion of the sparkover voltage and on the nature of the cumulative probability curve. A general correlation, valid for a wide variety of electrodes, has been established between the mean spark-over voltage gradient for positive switching impulses under dry conditions, and the corresponding influence of rain on the breakdown voltage."
"This paper analyzes the performance of the auxiliary systems of High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR) Reference Plant under conditions of degraded electrical network supply resulting from certain postulated power system disturbances. Specifically, an attempt is made to identify the particular conditions of non-standard frequence and/or voltage at which the generator's capability to produce power starts to decrease and, if such condition exists, to identify the particular equipment (electrical or mechanical) whose performance is causing the limitation. A discussion of the effects arising from specified changes of voltage and/or frequency on plant operation is presented. A set of degraded electrical network supply conditions has been assumed to have originated from system switching, load changes or due to abrupt loss of major generation, transmission lines or major interconnecting ties."
"Both in off-line and in on-line operation of energy systems, the computer has become an important ally of the engineer. However, results of calculations often obscure properties of steady state of the network. What will the power system network reaction be if one or more nodal voltage varies? How will these variations be reflected at certain nodes? How can one find rapidly a good operating strategy, even if not the best? Answers could be given by using non-linear programming procedures. Nevertheless, fast solutions can be found if heuristic techniques are introduced. This paper proposes to provide the power engineer with a class of indices which clears qualitatively the steady state of energy system network."
"The paper discusses recent reviews of electric power engineering programs and the importance of evaluating such programs. A comprehensive list of multiple evaluative criteria is recommended to review the purpose, minimum qualifications, resources, and activities of an electric power engineering program. Periodic assessment is recommended instead of rating of programs. Data for assessment could be gathered by visiting teams assigned by the IEEE Power Engineering Society."

"This paper treats the analysis of a caisson foundation subjected to lateral loads and embedded in a multi-layered soil with special emphasis on their use in transmission line structures. The method developed which is based on the subgrade modulus concept, aside from being useful for the design of a caisson foundation for limited displacements, can be used for determining the stiffness of a given foundation. A rational method of evaluating, the foundation stiffness is very useful to the designer since he can then treat the superstructure and the foundation as an entity rather than two separate entities and can thus optimize the total cost of the structure/foundation system. Results from load tests on a prototype caisson in sand and clay, designed by this method, indicate reasonably fair correlation with those predicted by the theoretical analysis."
"This paper describes a frequency response method for analyzing the stability of subsynchronous oscillations in power systems, as modeled by a number of synchronous machines and an extensive series compensated transmission network. This method allows the simultaneous detailed modeling of all machine shafts and control loops, and hence permits investigation of possible interaction in the subsynchronous oscillation frequency band between machines in different plants. An example application of the method indicates that such interactions may, indeed, occur."
"This paper presents a close analysis of the stability of subsynchronous oscillations in a radial series compensated power system. A frequency response analysis is used. The analysis covers varying levels of detail in generator electrical and mechanical modeling and thereby illustrates the mechanism by which subsynchronous oscillations can become unstable. The basic purpose of this paper is tutorial; a companion paper discusses its mathematical basis and full scale application of its method."
"The linearized differential equations describing the dynamics of an electrical power system are developed in polynomial matrix form. This reduces the number of variables from the state variable form of the equations, keeping only those appearing at the interface between the generating units and the transmission system. Algorithms are described which allow the eigenvalues to be assigned to a system described in this form, and allow the eigenvectors to approximate a desired set of eigenvectors. An example from the problem of forming a reduced order model of a power system is given."

"The use of Lyapunov functions in Lyapunov's Direct Method for analyzing power system transient asymptotic stability is studied. A previous study by other investigators claimed to establish the asymptotic stability of a multimachine system with damping included. In the present paper it is demonstrated that the Lyapunov function used in the earlier study is not sufficient for this purpose. In addition the weakness of Lyapunov-type functions obtained from energy considerations in the study of asymptotic stability is discussed. Then, a method is presented which explains how to construct a satisfactory Lyapunov function for study of asymptotic stability for electric power systems. This method uses linear algebra to convert n second order differential equations to a set of 2n first order equations so that a certain vector product may be used as the Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function is used to obtain a region of asymptotic stability for such a system. Practical uses of these results in generating system design and expansion are discussed. Finally, a numerical example illustrating the technique is presented."
"Laboratory tests confirm computer calculations of the current distribution among the subconductors of 1,100-kV bundles. The test specimen consisted of a 120-foot (36.57 m) long 8- × 1.6-inch (4 cm) Chukar conductor bundle suspended 29 feet (8.84 m) above ground at BPA's outdoor test facility. Currents in the individual subconductors were measured at 3 degrees of bundle asymmetry. Good agreement between calculated and measured currents verifies BPA's computer program for calculating the current distributions within conductor bundles."
"High current density homopolar machines which employ current collectors containing a liquid metal, such as NaK, require critical support systems to guarantee long term machine operation. This report describes experimental results concerning materials compatibility, liquid metal recirculation and purification systems, and the inert, protective cover gas systems necessary for machine operation. Experimental studies, as well as operation of a 3000 HP, 107,000 ampere, 20 volt, dc homopolar generator have demonstrated the necessity of such subsystems to continued machine operation."
"This paper describes a probabilistic approach to computing information on off-peak energy potential of an electric power system useful for studies related to economic assessment and duty cycle prediction of energy storage devices. Effect of minimum generation limits of generators on system operation and associated economic penalties can also be evaluated by this method. The methodology is similar to generating capacity reliability evaluation. Computation of expected off-peak energy and expected capacity margin durations is illustrated by a system example and sensitivity of these quantities to generating unit size is evaluated. Suggestions are made how the existing computer programs using frequency and duration method of generating capacity reliability evaluation and probabilistic production cost evaluation method can be used to determine off-peak energy information."

"The dynamic performance of a multi-machine power system can be studied by obtaining the equations in state variable form and examining the characteristics of the [A] matrix. A formulation is described to write the original differential and algebraic equations in a form that reduces the matrix conversion time to obtain the [A] matrix by convenient partitioning. The efficiency of eigenvalue sensitivity calculations is similarly improved. Calculations for a three machine sample system are included."
"Davison's method is used to reduce the order of a one machine infinite bus system with excitation control from a tenth to a fourth order System. This is accomplished by first reducing the machine from seventh to third order and the excitation system from third to first order and then combining these models to form the reduced order model of the one machine infinite bus system. It is shown that the eigenvalues which predict the natural and introduced rotor oscillations are accurately preserved by this method. Also, a method of combining reduced order models of machines to form dynamic equivalents of multimachine systems is set forth. Here, Davison's method is used to obtain a reduced order model of each machine whereupon approximations are used to achieve a simple means of combining these reduced order models to form a dynamic equivalent of a two machine system. This technique is shown to be sufficiently accurate for dynamic stability investigations. It appears that the method of reduction presented in this paper may offer advantages in the analysis of power system dynamics."
"A highly efficient method for digital calculation of transients on transmission lines with frequency-dependent effects is presented. The most time consuming part of calculating the transmission line transients in time-domain techniques such as traveling-wave methods is numerical evaluation of real-time convolution for including the frequency-dependent effects of the transmission lines. In the new method developed in the paper, a time response of a frequency-dependent parameter is simulated with linear curves. Then, the convolution in time-domain is evaluated by a sum of very few multiplications of the time response and a traveling-wave variable in which the effect of the frequency dependent parameter is to be included. Computation time required for the convolution is reduced to much less than one tenth, and the total computation time of a transient calculation is easily reduced by half compared with conventional methods for calculating transmission line transients."

"The \"Electrogeometric\" Theory, developed for transmission line lightning performance calculations, is applied to distribution systems as a means of predicting arrester discharge currents. The resulting rates of occurrence and frequency distributions compare favorably with presently available information. The effect of stroke location on attester current is explained and shown to be significant. Predischarge and pole reflections are shown to have similar effects, and do not significantly affect crest current. Footing resistance is accounted for. Indirect strokes are treated briefly and shown to produce minimal arrester current."
"The use of combined voltage and current feedback for converter control was investigated. A simplified linear model for a monopolar dc link was developed for analysis of large and small disturbances. Using parameters from the proposed EPRI - Consolidated Edison 100 MW dc link, an eigenvalue analysis was performed, in which a compensated current feedback control was compared with the system using voltage feedback. Results of the linearized analysis showed that the use of voltage feedback appears to offer greater damping of system oscillations and considerably faster large-signal response than the use of a conventional current regulator. A detailed hybrid computer simulation of the 100 MW dc link was also used in the investigation. The ac system, individual converter valves, converter controls, and the dc line are fully represented in the simulation. Computer studies were made for various operations and disturbances, in which the current control was compared with the system using voltage feedback. Generally the results of the simulation agree with the basic conclusions reached from the linear analysis, however, the use of the simplified linear model for selecting optimum control parameters was in several cases shown to be somewhat inaccurate."

Information provided herein and in the guide should serve as an aid to the power and the telecommunications utilities who may be involved in organizing and implementing an inductive coordination program for high voltage direct- current (HVdc) facilities with wire communications.

"The paper describes an investigation of impulse breakdown phenomena in hydrogen and hydrogen/SF6mixtures for positive rod-plane gaps at pressures up to 3 bar and spacings up to 0.25m. It is shown that mixtures with an SF6content of less than 1% by volue can have breakdown voltages more than twice those for hydrogen and that the breakdown voltage-pressure characteristics in mixtures are similar in shape to those reported for pure SF6in that there is a pressure region where the breakdown voltage falls as pressure is increased. The results are discussed with reference to observations of the effect of SF6on the prebreakdown corona activity."

"A simple equation derived from two calculable border cases and the asymptotic limits of a symmetrical multi-section transmission line is discussed in the light of experience gained from model studies on stabilisation of power transmission over distances exceeding 600 miles at 60Hz using saturated reactors. An equivalent transient reactance of a saturated reactor can be found from which the permissible product of the length of the compensated line and its power transmission capacity can be determined with satisfactory approximation. The transient reactance of saturated reactors appears to be the same as their slope reactance. Capacitive compensation of the slope reactance introduces transiently higher reactances which can be reduced but not eliminated by adequate dimensioning of the capacitor bypass filters. An empirical equation for calculating this effect is given. Combination of stabilisation by saturated reactors without slope compensation with others having it may take advantage of the differing favourable features of both and enable a desired power capability to be achieved in the most economical way. The general importance of model and analogue studies for any type of long line stabilisation is emphasised."
"The dependence of the rate of rise of the recovery voltage upon the pressure was obtained for liquid SF6 at pressures of 1500 psi. The relationship between dv/dt, di/dt and cross sectional area of the nozzle was determined experimentally, and the similarity of the results Obtained in separate investigations made with a 1/2 inch diameter nozzle has also been discussed."
"In this paper equations are derived to calculate static pressures which may occur within faulted oil filled distribution transformers as a result of arcing and gas generation, under known conditions such as tank dimensions, air space, specific fuses, and specific pressure relief devices; and unknown quantities such as actual fault current, arc length, arc location, and gas temperatures. The behavior of arcs under oil, the character of pressures in transformers, and the effect on distribution transformer pressure of various fusing means are discussed in the paper. Calculated transformer static pressure values are useful not only for the design of the transformer enclosure, but also for the design of the distribution system, the selection of protective fusing, and the formulation of operating procedures. The paper is largely based on Electric Power Research Institute (E.P.R.I.) project and report RP 325-1."
"Determination of the critical stability region has been the most time-consuming part in the transient stability analysis by Liapunov's direct method. In power systems this requires the computation of the unstable equilibrium state of the system closest to its postfault stable equilibrium state. Recently some schemes [1,2] have been proposed for the approximate determination of the closest unstable equilibrium state. In this paper an algorithm based on the physical behavior of the power system is presented. This method is pragmatic, exact, more reliable, and computationally faster than the previous ones. Numerical results of the test studies on two different power systems are also included."
"A method is developed to determine equivalents for extensive power systems external to an internal system equipped with a central control computer. These equivalents are needed for different system studies where the internal system is represented in detail, and the external system is represented by the equivalent to simulate the interaction effects of the external system on the internal system for disturbances originating in the internal system. The method uses a generalized Thevenin's theory for representing the quasi-steady-state performance of the external system and stochastic linear difference equations to represent the dynamic changes in the internal equivalent voltage magnitudes and phase angles. The methods are demonstrated on two test systems."
"Insulator contamination is the decisive factor in making insulation design of most transmission lines in Japan. This paper describes the performance of contaminated insulators against a short-time ac overvoltage in the order of several cycles, taking into consideration comparatively higher overvoltage due to the one-phase-to-ground fault of recent long-distance bulk power transmission lines with series capacitors. It has been made clear by this study that, in the case of a fault clearance within 0.07 sec, e.g., the flashover voltage increases by about 15% more than in a continuous energization. This implies that the insulation of series-capacitor-compensated lines can be met by the conventional insulation design levels."
"In substituting a degree of imbalance between the phase impedances of HVdc converter transformers for the usual assumption of equal impedances, the generated ac harmonics are modified and triplen (non-characteristic) harmonics are produced. They are analysed and assessed; and are not expected to be serious provided due attention is paid to impedance balancing. Certain normal harmonics for 6-pulse operation are ideally eliminated by 12-pulse operation. An analysis is made of the extent of residual 6-pulse harmonics due to the imperfect balance of 12-pulse bridge operation. The paper provides a basis for specifying certain design tolerances."
"Inverse time overcurrent relays with various time-current characteristics are required for matching the characteristics of other protective devices and thermal characteristics of the protected equipment. The authors have presented, in this paper, a method wherein any time-current characteristic curve of overcurrent relays can be synthesized from small segments which are realized using only linear components and, therefore, follow a simple and definite mathematical law. Since, in the proposed approach, the characteristic curve is not obtained by fitting nonlinearities of components into it, the accuracies with which the characteristic can be produced and repeated both are very high."

"The estimation of system transient recovery voltages from system diagrams requires a determination of \"effective\" parameters. This is a study of 345 KV field data, produced by a current pulse test circuit, which shows the types of transient recovery voltage characteristic of both local sources, and local sources paralleled with remote sources. The test results are compared to calculated values, using techniques of the TRV application guide, ANSI Standard C37.0721-1971."
"The optimally damped capacitive voltage dividers have superior characteristics for fast-rise impulse voltage measurements in the megavolt range. The step response for these EHV dividers is required for determination of their dynamic properties as well as for calculation of the response to arbitrary waves. Presently methods are available only to determine the response time of the EHV dividers.The lumped constants of the high voltage arm can readily be measured whereas the measurement of low voltage arm parameters is very difficult. As divider response is very sensitive to latter parameters the determination of step response by theoretical calculations will have restricted validity. In this paper a new experimental method has been proposed to synthesize the step response of the terminating system. It consists in the determination of the responses of the measuring system to a step voltage and an exponentially decaying wave of proper magnitude and sign and super-position of the two to obtain the step response of the terminating system. This procedure has been applied to a model damped capacitive voltage divider with satisfactory results. Numerical calculations for a practical 5MV, EHV divider available at EdF France has shown that the technique is suitable even for EHV dividers."
"This paper offers a numerical approach to the determination of the magnetic field distribution, in a semi-infinite space, filled with conductive ferromagnetic materiaI. Simple mathematical functions are used to simulate the saturation and hysteresis characteristics of a given material. The case of a sinusoidal magnetic field, applied uniformly on the boundary plane, is studied as an example. The paper offers an analysis of the field distribution during the transient period, as well as an evaluation of steady-state characteristics like surface current density, penetration depth, power los - ses and power factor. The comparison of steady-state results with those given by other methods, is discussed at the end of the paper."

"In actual practice the withstand voltage level of air insulation is estimated by an extrapolation based on the 50% breakdown voltage, U50%, and the standard deviation, σ both obtained by laboratory tests. For this extrapolation to be possible it is assumed that the breakdown probability follows a gaussian distribution. It is observed however that in many cases this distribution deviates appreciably from a normal. Unexpected inconsistencies of the breakdown probability are also observed. This particular behavior of air insulation is studied in the present report and a physical explanation is attempted."
"This paper describes a laboratory model of a turbogenerator and associated computer system for on-line closed loop control. This has been used to investigate the performauce of the generator with a linear optimal controller, which provides integrated control of governor and excitation systems.

"With a model SF6gas blast interrupter, arc extinction performance was investigated. The measurements were carried out for di/dt values ranging from 13 ∼ 27 A/µs, for RRRV extending from 3.5∼ 13.0kV/µs and for a fixed pressure of 15kg/cm2. On the other hand, the voltage and current wave forms near current zero in the short line fault (SLF) test circuit were calculated employing Mayr's equation and the interrupting capability was investigated using the arc time constant and arc voltage obtained from the experimental results. From this calculation, the following relation was found. RRRVc ∞ (i)-(2.2∼2.45). The theoretical calculation was found to coincide satisfactorily with the experiments."
"In inverter operation of a converter for h.v.d.c. transmission, commutation failure is inevitable in such a case that a.c. voltage suddenly drops due to occurrence of a fault in the a.c. system. In this paper, the region of inevitable commutation failure is first discussed and then the constant power factor control system is proposed to squeeze the region. By using this control system, the extinction angle is kept larger in partial load than in full load. Also, the proposed control system makes it possible to rapidly increase d.c. transmission power from the minimum to full loads without controlling transformer taps."
"Dynamic oscillations at a large pumped storage plant equipped with excitation systems of nominal voltage response ratio and connected to a tightly coupled transmission grid are investigated. The results of eigenvalue and transient stability investigations correlate well with the characteristics of the disturbance as interpreted from field measurements. However, the actual dynamic stability margin is somewhat higher than that determined analytically. The excitation control system is shown to be the practicable means for improving damping of the natural mechanical oscillations. Damping can be increased to desired margins during the critical maximum pumping condition by placing the automatic voltage regulators for some of the units at the multi-unit plant on manual control."
"Electromagnetic fields in close proximity to transmission line towers are calculated using moment method procedures. The method of moments is especially suited to problems which involve electromagnetic coupling to metal objects and, in principle, most any type geometry can be solved. Generally, this technique involves the solution of an integral equation for the current and charge induced on the object by an external field. Metal transmission line towers are modeled as a collection of straight cylindrical sections of varying radii. Because the wavelength of a 60 Hz field is much larger than the cross sectional area of the segments, the problem can be categorized as \"scattering by thin wires\". The current and charge distributions induced on a 230/138 kV double circuit transmission line tower are calculated. Utilization is made of the induced current and charge for the purpose of determining the fields near the towers. Comparison is also made between calculated and measured near fields."
"This paper briefly describes the results of the first phase of the systems analysis part of a research project to assess energy storage systems suitable for use by electric utilities. U.S. electric utility systems load and generation data that were collected and analyzed in order to select a number of systems most representative of the electric utility industry are described. The representative systems in turn are used to determine the potential total amount and distribution of off-peak energy available on individual systems on an annual, seasonal, weekly and daily basis. The amount of off-peak energy is described as functions of annual hourly load shape, capacity level assumed available for producting off-peak energy, generator performance characteristics (forced and maintenance outages), and energy storage device round trip efficiency."
"This paper describes the algorithms used by METAP - a transients program with a modular, expandable element-library. Each element is a computationally independent entity that can encapsulate an arbitrarily detailed model of a power system device - a synchronous machine or a transformer, for instance - together with a numerical procedure especially suited to the calculation of its responses. New elements can be added to the library whenever new models Or numerical procedures are needed. This modeling and computational flexibility is made possible by the use of unusual procedures for describing and solving networks. These procedures are described in some detail and their applicational aspects illustrated by means of an example."
"Insulation of 3.3 kV and 6.6 kV XLPE and PE cables was found to be mechanically stressed by 20 to 100 kg/cm2during the process of water tree formation. Infrared absorption curves change if water trees are created. A mechanism of the generation of water trees is discussed in detail. Critical values to judge the level of insulation quality are recommended as 0.01 ω. F for electrical resistance and 5% for tan δ. A lifetime curve is presented to estimate remaining lifetime of cables with water trees."
"A high arc voltage being essential to interrupt currents without a zero pause, it has become compulsory to use compressed air as an interrupting medium in generator breakers. The use of compressed air for cooling purposes has resulted in simpler, hence more reliable breakers. The circuit breakers PKG have been subjected to short-circuit current interruptions up to 340 kA. For configurations where the generator delivers through two transformers, a new arrangement of interrupting equipment has been proposed in order to meet the resulting increase of short-circuit currents."
"The actual ratio of output voltage to input voltage of a group of cascade connected transformers increases with increase in load capacitance. In addition, the voltage distribution within a cascade group is frequently non-uniform and usually the final transformer developes the highest voltage. Both the output voltage and the voltage across the final unit can be obtained by multiplying the primary voltage by the appropriate ratios. Calculations and measurements show that these ratios are linear functions of the input admittance which is readily measured by measuring the input voltage and current. This is possible even with intermediate compensating reactors and also with parallel/ cascade arrangements."
"High water pressure hot-line insulator washing equipment has been developed and in service in Japan as an effective measure to prevent the contamination flashovers of apparatus insulators at 500-kV class substations.

"The paper presents a method for computing exactly the frequency and duration of load loss events as measures of generating system reliability. The method utilizes an exact state capacity model together with a cumulative state load model which requires no idealization. Efficient computer algorithms for building the exact state capacity model and computing the system reliability indices are presented."
"The method of successive images is used to obtain accurate values of maximum surface voltage gradients for practical HVdc transmission lines. The results are presented in the form of graphs of gradient factors as a function of the principal line parameters. The gradient factor when multiplied by the line to ground voltage yields the maximum voltage gradient at the conductor surface. The range of values of parameters chosen covers transmission lines of voltages up to about ± 1200 kV. These graphs are also applicable for determining the center phase gradients on ac lines and therefore should be useful in making comparative studies between ac and dc systems. The results include an analysis of the sensitivity of the conductor surface voltage gradient to variations: in spacing between positive and negative conductors; in height; and in subconductor spacing. An optimum subconductor spacing is found for different numbers of conductors in the bundle as well as for different conductor sizes. However, it is shown that the gradient values are insensitive to fairly large variations in subconductor spacing about an optimum value. Finally, the accurate results presented are compared wlth those obtained for both dc and ac lines using some of the methods found in the literature."

 "Automobile ignition noise is due to fast rise-time (impulsive) currents that flow in the vehicle's wiring. The major sources of these impulses are the breakdown in the distributor of the gap between the rotor and the posts, the breakdown of the spark plug gap, and the closure of the breaker points. Each of these sources can be treated individually to suppress the ignition noise. Concepts have been developed and prototypes built and tested for incorporating simple low-pass filters directly into the spark plug (by appropriate sizing of the plug's shell and inner electrode) and into the distributor. The intent of the work was to take an individual vehicle, already suppressed by the techniques used in mass production at the time (1972) in the United States, and to improve that suppression by at least 10 dB over the frequency range 30 to 500 MHz. The amount of suppression improvement obtained, determined by comparison of frequency-scanned peak field strength, ranged from about 13 dB to about20 dB depending upon the frequency. Similar improvements were obtained on a vehicle selected at random. Preliminary measurements (made only on the first vehicle) indicate no undesirable effects upon the vehicle's operation or its exhaust emissions at three conditions. The cost of incorporating these suppression techniques into mass-produced automobiles is not known exactly but is believed by the authors to be nominal."
"Innovative techniques and attention to frequently-ignored factors have been combined in a new personal radio signaling system. Accessed by means of Touch-Tone®service, customer dialing errors are effectively controlled through the use of self-checking numbers, eliminating a common cause of missed or false signals. A multiplicity of radio transmitters are arranged to provide adequate building penetration for the entire service area. Simultaneous transmitter operation and low speed, digital receivers work together to make use of multipath radio propagation. Redundancy of equipment and terminal functions assure that electronic failures result in minimal impairment of service. Combining all of the above design features has resulted in a service that is significantly more reliable than that which is provided by systems of earlier design."

"It is known that mobile communication systems are susceptible to radio-frequency interference (RFI) generated by automotive ignition systems. In this paper the automotive ignition noise generated by individual engine cylinders is investigated. Using specially designed instrumentation, the pulse amplitude densities of individual cylinder ignition noise are measured and analyzed. It is found that the ignition noise generated by the individual cylinders is not statistically uniform and the modes of the pulse amplitude densities of different cylinders may differ by as much as 30 dB (as measured by an antenna positioned to one side of the vehicle). The measurement procedure and results discussed in this paper may prove to be valuable in the diagnosis of ignition system RFI."
"A functional land mobile service requires that radio communications be ensured outside as well as inside of motorway tunnels. An experimental investigation about radiation and propagation of VHF radio waves in a 150-m motorway tunnel is presented. Three radiating systems, to convey radio signals into and out of the tunnel, are examined: antennas slotted coaxial cable balanced two-wire line. Results are presented in the form of total attenuation (total attenuation is the transmission loss (radiation and heat loss) plus coupling loss) versus distance curves and also as cumulative distribution curves of coupling loss, in the case of the radiating lines. A comparison among these three systems is also given."
"Improved response time in providing emergency medical services (EMS) is attained through development of regional or areawide radio communications, permitting the use of common dispatch or control centers to coordinate and optimize use both of the facilities available for emergency medical treatment and of the radio spectrum allocated for this function. With the allocation last year of radio channels earmarked for emergency medical communications, the need for a coordinated approach to permit shared use of these channels became evident. A common control system permitting dynamic channel assignment to multiple areas, and including the function of computer-aided dispatch, is described and a typical application is shown."
"This paper examines the possible application to police communications of a dispersed array of low-power stations operating under an area-wide channel plan. A technique is given for generating the complex channel plans that are used. It is shown that police effectiveness is not reduced and that the concept permits unlimited growth of cities at the highest population density with a fixed and reasonable number of new channels."

"For designing a land mobile radio system, particularly a small zone high capacity system in the UHF band, various performance degradation causes, such as signal fading, cochannel interference, intermodulation disturbance, and sensitivity suppression, should be inclusively taken into account. The magnitudes of these degradations vary with time, because of field strength variation due to multipath fading, environmental shadowing effect, and the distance of mobile station from the base. Hence the circuit performance objective given in a probablistic form must be allotted for in each one of these causes. Variabilities of these degradations are estimated in terms of desired and undesired signal field strength variations. In the estimation, path diversity effect is considered and a root square sum approximation technique is employed. Also, the process used to determine the allottment is proposed from the viewpoints of efficient frequency utilization and realizability of base and mobile radio equipment."
"Multiple zone structure in a land mobile system seems to offer a flexibility in radio zone planning by using different interference distances conforming to the different system requirements in a system, thus improving the frequency utilization. A multiple zone structure can be formed by a tessellation of basic zone groups with an identical shape in parallel translation on a plane. To assure the possibility of the tessellation, two types of basic zone groups are investigated. One has several hexagonally shaped zones covered by an omnidirectional antenna beam from the zone center, while another is constructed as a subdivision of hexagons covered by a directive antenna beam. The former is expected to facilitate reduced interference distance between adjacent frequencies. An estimate of the latter type has shown better frequency economy than that in a conventional zone structure."
"After discussing the nature of the electromagnetic field in urban environments, and the use of diversity techniques in fading media, the paper presents a survey of these techniques as applied to mobile radio, with emphasis on systems designed for analogue communication. It includes a unified approach to systems based on the double-heterodyne phase-stripper principle. The discussion is not restricted to present-day receivers only, but includes considerations which may apply in future designs."
"A computer program has been written to simulate antenna performance on a small ground plane. The solution for a quarter-wavelength antenna has been expanded to include larger antennas with more complex current distributions. This paper includes a summary of the computer program and presents gain relationships between a quarter-wavelength antenna and various gain antennas over different sized ground planes. Experimental data which verify the results of the program are also presented."

 "The history of emergency medical services (EMS) communication systems development from the FCC's first allocation of frequencies for hospitals and ambulances up to the present is discussed. Up until the late 1960's EMS communication systems were virtually nonexistent. Most early networks were developed by hospital associations for coordination of hospital disaster operations. Many significant changes were seeded in 1966. By 1968, ambulance-to-hospital communications was growing in importance. Advanced life support systems were introduced into the United States with the aid of biomedical telemetry systems. These two separate systems have been effectively linked with the aid of Docket 19880 and the \"common system\" approach. The road ahead looks clear."
"An effective communications capability is an absolute necessity to the success of any emergency medical services system. This paper discusses the common systems approach adopted in Docket 19880 as the most effective way to provide for today's medical communications requirements."
"The passage of the Emergency Medical Services Systems (EMSS) Act of 1973 by Congress has provided the mechanism and funds for communities to develop regional EMS delivery systems across the Nation. With the passage of the EMSS Act, the Congress mandated that emergency medical care programs funded with Federal dollars must address, plan, and implement a \"systems approach\" for the provision of emergency response and medical care. In the EMSS Act, some fifteen component requirements have been identified to assist system planners, coordinators, and operators in their attempts to establish comprehensive, areawide and regional EMS programs. These components are: manpower, training, communications, transportation, facilities critical care units, public safety agencies, consumer participation, accessibility to care, transfer agreements, standard medical record keeping, consumer information and education, evaluation, disaster linkage, and mutual aid agreements. Development of a national program, its projects, and progress, is the basis of this report."
"The lack of adequate area-wide communications and the absence of institutions responsible for coordinating regional emergency care services represents a problem of major dimensions to this country. Each year over 115,000 people die from accidents, and more than 50 million are injured. Estimates go as high as 90,000 lives a year that could be saved with adequate emergency care. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's program, which is described, is aimed at generating a national effort to establish well planned regional emergency medical communications systems to coordinate emergency and disaster medical services throughout relatively large geographic areas or population centers. Such communications systems have been tried successfully in a number of cities. What has been missing is the wherewithal, both financially and professionally. to implement a sufficient number of similar programs to speed the wide adoption of there systems within the structure of American medical care."
"The field of emergency medical services (EMS)provides an organizational and operational environment which lacks the geopolitical structure and discipline of other public safety services. The opportunity to rearrange the various service provider elements of EMS into a unified regional agency is not likely in current political and economic circumstances. The new EMS radio communications structure which has evolved from Federal Communications Commission Docket 19880 provides the opportunity for operational order and discipline within the various provider elements of EMS. Despite the opportunity for creating the common system approach to EMS communications, many human elements must be dealt with in breaking down traditional barriers to change."
"The evolution of modern-day emergency medical service (EMS) systems is briefly described and the problems in implementing such systems are discussed. The communication needs and the actions of the Federal Communications Commission are discussed as they relate to present day activities. The problems in planning and implementing an EMS system are discussed with recommendations on methods to resolve problems. The needs for system planning for wide geographic areas are considered of paramount importance. The rapid emergence of a newly developing service delivered by private enterprise, as well as local government, does not detract from the responsibility of local government to assure that such services are provided. EMS is considered to be the third force of emergency services, with police and fire being the two recognized established ones."
"The provision of efficient public safety services continues to be one of the high priority efforts to improve the quality of life in our nation. These efforts are too often equipment oriented without realizing the system input of providing better services in terms of benefit to the public as opposed to providers of the services. These services are multielement containing many items which can be quantified and qualitative aspects which are difficult to assess. The methodology presented herein is designed to specifically evaluate such multi-element systems in a logical manner. Its use expanded to other than emergency medical service systems will permit weak areas to be identified, develop comparisions and rank system elements as to their individual contributions to \"bottom line\" results, and to help establish priorities for allocation of funding resources."
"In 1972, the Arizona State Legislature established the Division of Emergency Medical Services within the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS). As a part of the legislation, the Legislature charged the Director of the DPS with the responsibility for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the Statewide Emergency Meidcal Services Communications System (EMSCOM). This system was to have the capability of providing for intercommunication of all law enforcement agencies and personnel, ambulances, ambulance services and dispatchers, and emergency receiving facilities and other health care institutions and medical practitioners. With financial assistance from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Public Safety embarked upon a demonstration program of developing an EMSCOM across the northern part of the State of Arizona. The primary aim of the program was to find the most effective means of providing two-way voice communications between the various elements of the EMS system over large geographic areas with a very sparse population located in relatively few population centers. The UHF system-designed, purchased, and installed prior to new EMS frequencies, made available by the Federal Communications Commission by their rule making in Docket #19880-presented a number of technical and operational problems related to radio signal propagation charactersitics over our large geographic areas and rugged terrain. Efforts to minimize the geographic signal propagation problems resulted in the incorporation of receiver voting-as well as associated transmitter selection-techniques. Design of the dispatch control console incorporated features to allow the console operator to communicate with all hospitals, ambulance drivers, and paramedics over the entire area of operation. The control console also incorporated the use of telephone patching equipment to allow all elements of the EMS system to communicate with each other through two-way radio, microwave, and telephone facilities."
"A statewide emergency medical radio communications UHF network is operational in New Mexico 1) to link larger medical facilities to the state's sparsely populated rural areas, which have limited or no medical resources and marginal telephone communications, and 2) to assist callers in notifying local medical help, including backup ambulance dispatch capability. Radios have been installed in 95 percent of all certified ambulance and fire rescue services, all hospitals, and many clinics. Three RWJF grantees-the State EMS Division, Presbyterian Medical Services, and the Navajo Health Authority-have coordinated responsibility for UHF equipment installation, operation, maintenance, and public education. The centralized component of the network is maintained by two centers: Medical Crisis Center (MCC) and Santa Fe Control (SFC). Statewide telephone access and dispatch is provided through a 24-h"
"The Medical Emergency Radio Communication System (MERCS) for OH-9 illustrates a new system of emergency medical services (EMS) communications planned for the State of West Virginia. MERCS will be the first multicounty system to be implemented in the State-and will serve as a model for other areas. MERCS will provide a centrally coordinated system of EMS communications for the mountainous rural area of Southern West Virginia. It will exploit the rules of the FCC that provide for use of multichannel equipments and a system of full channel (UHF) mobile relay stations. A vehicle fitted for MERCS will be able to communicate on a common basis through any mobile relay in the system. The mobile relays will provide for communication among all participating public safety agencies, utilizing cross banding where appropriate for interface with the systems of cooperating public safety agencies. The result will be a fully integrated system of communications for EMS."
"Although adequate means for emergency communications are available, their utilization in daily emergencies and during medical disasters is amazingly inefficient. This phase of emergency health services is undergoing rapid expansion and improvement. These changes will narrow the time gap between the onset of an acute illness or injury and the implementation of techniques of monitoring and skilled management and care. The communications problems which have caused the medical field to lag far behind other emergency services can mostly be solved by existing knowledge and techniques. No longer should communications systems be designed for the exclusive use of one service or agency. First the emergency medical services (EMS) system must precede the communications subsystem. Only after the community has clearly defined its emergency medical needs and has designed a system to meet those needs should it look for the communication equipment that will serve to tie together the various elements of the system. This article defines the functions of communication, identifies communications systems requirements, and recommends means of implementing EMS communication networks. When these recommendations and plans are put into effect the emergency medical communications system will be the most widely utilized, coordinated, and sophisticated emergency communications systems within the area it serves."
"The development of biomedical telemetry systems involves design activities from numerous and varied engineering disciplines. The system design considerations are numerous; involving communications, biomedical science, transportation, personnel training, medico-legal problems, etc.. Manufacturers of biomedical telemetry equipment are competing in an emerging field with unsettled requirements, and with regulations by both the FCC and FDA. The development of more universal and more reliable systems is foreseen."
"Specifications and related documentation dealing with design requirements for electronic equipment used in EMS systems are reviewed and relevant portions cataloged. Where appropriate specifications do not exist, criteria are suggested for the operational, environmental, and functional performance standards to be used for the equipment."
"Emergency medical service (EMS) communication system design is discussed. The emphasis is on the development of communication systems to meet the needs of a patient in a medical emergency. Specific factors influencing patient-side portable communications are presented."
"The important role that land mobile communication systems play in the effective operation of an emergency medical services (EMS) system is discussed. The need for EMS systems, classification of types of communication subsystems, FCC Rules and Regulations for EMS, what to do before designing communication systems, and examples of several systems are given."
"The salient portions of these Rules and Regulations, which pertain specifically to EMS communications, are shown in boldface print."
"This standard defines the minimum requirements for a multiplex or nonmultiplex voice/telemetry channel to assure compatibility and interoperability of portable physiologic monitoring equipment with both radio and telephone equipments and hospital emergency and display devices. Specifically, it defines a National telemetry subcarrier frequency within the voice band which is compatible with both radio and telephone transmission characteristics. This standard applies only to voice and telemetry modulation-demodulation electronic instrumentation used in emergency medical care."

"We have made sustained efforts to develop a method of controlling thyristor chopper equipment by utilizing a magnetic phase shifter. These efforts have crystallized in the production of thyristor choppers used for the Japanese National Railway New Trunk Line cars, battery-operated locomotives used for the construction work of the Seikan Undersea Tunnel, and other projects. We have recently attained further success in developing a new method for controlling thyristor choppers, which is suitable for battery-operated vehicles such as fork lifts and electric cars. In contrast to the conventional method which causes the magnetic phase shifter to control the chopper ON-gate signals, this new method causes the magnetic phase shifter to control its OFF-gate signals. As a result, the chopper's region of a low conduction ratio, often used during brake control of battery-operated vehicles, can be controlled by the magnetic phase shifter region nearby its saturated region, thus quickening chopper response. In addition to this feature, the new method offers many additional merits."
"A brushless DC motor is proposed as a potential replacement for DC commutator type motors presently used in almost all automotive applications. A prototype brushless motor has been designed and assembled into the AC blower assembly used on many Ford vehicles in order to evaluate this motor in terms of performance, cost, maintenance, operating problems, size, and weight as compared to the existing commutator motor used in this blower. The new motor operates from the 12-volt vehicle battery through an electronic controller which replaces the lossy resistive controls used on the existing blower system. The new brushless motor is expected to result in the following improvements over the present blower motors: 1. Elimination of the brush-commutator system, which is presently a source of high maintenance and warranty costs on the AC/heaters in vehicles. The motor is maintenance free, except for bearing wear. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Defense for reliability predictions shows that commutator motors have a failure rate of from two to six times that of brushless motors, depending upon operating speed [1]. 2. Simpler construction of the brushless machine in which, besides eliminating the brush-commutator of the DC commutator type, a very simple, stationary, solenoidal electrical coil replaces the complex, rotating, armature winding of the commutator machine. No permanent magnets are used in the field. 3. Improved energy efficiency; the electronic control scheme eliminates the energy loss in resistors presently used to control speed. 4. The electrical winding in the brushless motor is not restricted as to shape or material, but can be adapted to suit the economic and technical restrictions of the time. Material can be copper, aluminum, or high conductivity alloys, and constructed from round, square, strip, or braided conductors. 5. The motor is insensitive to temperature variations compared to PM motors. 6. Due to the simple structure of the motor, the overall volume occupied by the blower assembly is reduced about 25%. 7. A damaged or burned out electrical coil can be quickly and simply replaced without the need for replacing any other motor parts."
"The achievement of safe and efficient longitudinal control is probably the most significant technical problem associated with individual automated-vehicle transport systems such as PRT, dual-mode, and the automatic highway. Several aspects of such control are of concern here: the specification of a realistic model of vehicle longitudinal dynamics; the use of those dynamics in the design of a vehicle controller to meet specifications typical of those for future systems; and the implementation and full-scale testing of the designed controller."
"This paper compares public mobile telephone systems world-wide, encompassing key radio and operational characteristics on both the overall system and mobile unit levels. The comparisons also include the status of evolutionary development regarding degree of automation, number of subscribers, geographic availability of service, mobile unit costs, and major developments anticipated in the technological upgrading and physical expansion of services."
"Since its inception in 1957, the growth of air-ground, public radio/telephone (AGPRT) service has seen rather modest growth with annual shipments of airborne radio units in 1975 amounting to only about $1.5 million. However, with the continued rapid expansion of business aviation, and improved air-ground, radio/telephone service provided by wider ground station coverage and better quality airborne sets, it is expected that significant growth in air-ground telephone services will occur during the next decade. This paper examines the past history of public air-ground radio/telephone services and the various factors that inhibited more rapid growth in both the civil air carrier and general aviation fields. It provides descriptions of existing systems and reviews past frequency assignments and general problems that have tended to discourage more widespread use of this service. This report projects both air carrier and general aviation activity where air-ground public radio telephone (AGPRT) has a tremendous service potential. With a population of some 75,000 business aircraft anticipated by 1985, it anticipates that tremendous growth in AGPRT is quite possible. It reviews the status of active and pending ground station licenses, the amount of present and projected traffic through typical ground stations and reviews the products and plans of both equipment manufacturers and service companies in the field. In addition, this analysis includes a review of FCC Docket 18262 and its implications for AGPRT service, the possible renewed interest on the part of air carriers in this service in preparation for the 1979 World Administrative Radio Conference, and the role of ARINC and other operators (including radio and telephone common carriers) in planning for and implementing new public air-ground radio services. The report concludes with the identification of key factors that will affect future activities in this field and permit the inherent growth potential to be realized."
"This paper covers a mobile radiotelephone system designed to upgrade present day Land-Mobile services to provide facilities comparable to those obtainable within any national land-based automatic switching telephone system. It shows a system which may provide national coverage, requiring minimal cooperation from individual participating RCC's, by use of interactive base stations."
"A computer-controlled terminal offers numerous advantages in efficiency and versatility when applied to a mobile-telephone communications system. This paper briefly describes a particular computer-controlled terminal and uses an example to show how complex systems requirements can be satisfied by using this terminal."
 "Various levels of protection from unauthorized use of a mobile-telephone service can be provided where the exchange for the service is under stored-program control. The security techniques that provide this protection can be upgraded on a per-subscriber or per-system basis as the incidence of unauthorized use increases. The \"ultimate\" arrangement provides for the encryption of variable passwords. Proper protection of auxiliary storage devices precludes compromise of the cipher-keys assigned to individual mobile units. The techniques that apply and, in particular, those that provide for better security, are more readily implemented in a system with common channel signaling where signaling speeds are considerably faster than those that are used in present-day practice."
"The High Capacity Mobile Telephone Communications System (HCMTS) employs a 20K baud digital signaling system to provide information needed in the various stages of call setup and control. This paper describes the signal processing required for transmission and recovery of this digital information over the Rayleigh fading channel environment. An overview of the mobile data recovery system along with a discussion of spectrum considerations is given. Also, laboratory data taken with a Rayleigh fading simulator and results from field testing are given."
 "Mobile communication link through electromagnetically obstructed areas can be established by using wayside leaky coaxial cables. Available experimental data had been limited to 450 MHz. This paper presents the results of a recent experiment of the RADIAX cable at 900 MHz in near field. These data are used to supplement an earlier RADIAX experiment at below 450 MHz and to compare with a theoretical study at 1 GHz."
"Radio wave propagation between base and mobile stations is normally described as being Rayleigh distributed due to multipath interference. When the multipath is made up of a limited number of radio waves, the variations in signal amplitude follows a Weibull distribution. The transmission loss deviation has been defined as the dB difference between the 50 and 90% points on the Weibull distribution. Data will be presented showing loss deviation between 3 dB and 30 dB. Shadow loss over hills and around buildings are usually assumed to be knife-edge or rounded knife-edge. Shadow loss based on these assumptions is generally found to be less than the true measured value. Data will be presented comparing calculated shadow loss with measured values."
"This paper describes a new simple switching-diversity technique without level detection. It adopts such method as to receive alternatively two RF signals received from different antenna branches at an adequate frequency. A few experimental tests have proved that this technique gives a significant improvement in signal transmission performance under the simulated Rayleigh fading channel at 900 MHz band."
"In the BTL-developed High Capacity Mobile Telecommunications System, a digital controller within the mobile Logic Unit allows mobiles to communicate with Cell Sites by means of a high-speed radio data link, and interacts with the user via switches and displays. This paper presents an overview of the controller. The switching and control functions that it performs and digital messages involved are first briefly described. This is followed by a description of its hardware design that exploits a microprocessor as the central processing unit."
"In order to better understand the ramifications of transmitting and receiving digital data over typical voice channels, a series of tests were performed in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, using existing local government transmitting sites and a specially equipped mobile unit. Carrier frequency, digital data transmission rate, modulation technique, range of transmis sion, speed of the mobile unit and the time of day were varied for test purposes. Tests were conducted in both urban and suburban environments. This paper discusses test procedures, sites, routes, test equipment and the results obtained."
"A method of generating a continuous position reference signal for use in the longitudinal control of automated ground transport systems is presented. The technique utilizes two specially excited four-wire helically wound transmission lines. The method of excitation, the signal detection and processing schemes necessary to obtain the control signal, and the results of preliminary laboratory tests are presented. The technique should provide a highly accurate, easily implementable and environmentally impervious means of generating a longitudinal reference signal."
"This paper describes several electronically-steered phased-array antennas for use in the HF, VHF and UHF bands. An approach is described which uses 4 vertical elements above the ground plane in a square pattern. With proper phasing, a directive beam of 97° width may be electronically switched in quadrants to provide full 360° azimuth coverage. This antenna provides significant forward gain and a high front-to-back ratio to provide suppression of interference not in the path of communication. An alternate approach uses three elements in a triangular configuration, each beam covering 120° of azimuth. Methods will be described for mode selection of omni and the four quadrantal directions using semiconductor switching."
"An increasing number of Radio Amateurs are utilizing their VHF and UHF allocations for mobile-to-mobile and mobile-to-repeater operation. In addition to the vast public service capabilities of this group, it also provides a proving ground for new devices and technology. Filling the needs of an expanding mobile service will not only require an increased supply of equipment but also careful engineering to assure high standards of technical performance."
"This paper describes a simple model for estimating propagation coverage in a multiple-transmitter paging system. The results of previous single-transmitter propagation studies are employed in a computer program where the resultant is a grid plot of hypothetical receiver locations, each with the expected number of transmitter signals exceeding the paging receiver threshold. The resultant plots readily show the areas where potential coverage problems may exist."
"Spectrum is a multidimensional quantity. Considering this, AM, SSB, FM and digital modulation are compared for best spectrum utilization. The evils of high transmitter power are enumerated and some system configurations using low power are discussed. In particular, Prearranged Communication Path (PCP) systems using chains of low power repeaters are described. Looking into the future, it is predicted that PCP Systems using Delta Modulation will be widely used, providing improved service with privacy and much better spectrum utilization."
"Increased use of radio channels is possible if fraction-of-a-second data messages are used to replace voice identification now used operationally and to satisfy FCC procedural rules. Recently developed equipment for the ATIS function is simple, reliable and low cost, so that it can be considered for universal use. The modulation, coding and circuit design technique used will be described as well as some applications and experimental results. This work is related to universal ATIS as explored in FCC Docket No. 20351, and comments will be offered on maximization of user benefits which might result from adoption of appropriate ATIS technical standards."
"An examination of land mobile frequency coordination practices points up the fact that the FCC has been far more aggressive and innovative than the private sector. In addition to discussing some cause and effect implications of these respective actions and inactions, this paper describes a practical mini-computer system which one user organization has attempted to develop as a means of demonstrating the viability of self-regulation, by the private land mobile community, of the frequency management function."
"This paper describes five different radio systems which are used in the Southern Pacific's large railroad freight classification yard located in Colton, California. Each of these systems is discussed in turn, with emphasis on how that system is tailored to satisfy a specific communications requirement in the operation of the Colton Yard. It is intended that a discussion of the various radio applications in this yard will illustrate the types of communications which are necessary for operation of any large classification yard."
"Three applications of modern technology are described in the field of fare collection for a regional transit system, including both bus and rail operations. The first application described includes electrical/electronic/pneumatic technology used in revenue-handling for Metrobus operations. The equipment is installed and operating in slightly over half our garages which account for approximately forty percent of our fleet. Installation and test are underway to complete the conversion by 31 May 1976. Ten installations are programmed for eight garages and approximately 1900 buses. The second application describes the use of stored-value Farecards for travel on our Metrorail system. This equipment embodies magnetic-stripe technology and a large number of microprocessors. First deliveries are scheduled this fall, and it is expected that, when the second group of rail stations is opened in early 1977, enough of this equipment will be available to equip all stations then in revenue operations. The third application describes an unmet need. Bus equipment which can handle the Metrorail Farecard is an obvious and anticipated extension of the system. Unfortunately, funding limitations have halted an UMTA/Mitre effort which was leading to such equipment. The needs of the system, and a brief description of the effort to date, may inspire some readers to pursue the matter further."
"This paper will describe the design, installation and operation of a multi-frequency rapid transit radio system utilized by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. It will contain discussions of the civil construction considerations, operational constraints and technical engineering detail that has gone into the implementation of the system. It will also touch briefly on those elements that might be changed or modified in light of actual operating experience."
"The railroad industry is successfully operating, co-channel, several radio controlled remote locomotive systems (slave locomotives) and cab signalling systems within radio range of each other through the use of high security digital transmission. The railroad radio service now has two pair of 450 MHz frequencies assigned nationwide for these systems. This paper will describe the extent these systems are presently being used and the methods employed to avoid intersystem interference while permitting sufficient air time to provide \"real time\" control and signalling to locomotives."
"Bus flow through a route is analyzed and modeled, and the effects of various control strategies on bus flow are measured using computer simulation. Passenger loading and unloading times are shown to be the mechanism whereby positive feedback occurs, amplifying deviations from schedule. The application of control to the route model results in a 67% reduction in the standard deviation of trip time, and a 25% reduction in passenger average waiting time."
 "This paper discusses various methods of improving the accuracy of a linear least squares solution algorithm which is commonly used in Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), hyperbolic location systems. Topics considered include methods of generating a useful weighting matrix and a residue examination scheme as the basis for rejecting data contaminated by large propagation delay errors. The performance of two linear schemes is compared to that of the nonlinear least squares solution using some 2000 sets of actual TDOA measurements."

As a part of that legislation, the Legislature charged the Director of the Department of Public Safety with the responsibility for the establishment, operation and maintenance of the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Communications System. This system was to have the capability of providing for intercommunication of all law enforcement agencies and personnel, ambulances, ambulance services and dispatchers, and emergency receiving facilities and other health care institutions and medical practitioners.

The UHF system--designed, purchased and installed prior to new EMS frequencies, made available by the Federal Communications Commission by their rule making in Docket #19880--presented a number of technical and operational problems related to radio signal propagation characteristics over our large geographic areas and rugged terrain. Efforts to minimize the geographic signal propagation problems resulted in the incorporation of receiver voting--as well as associated transmitter selection--techniques. Design of the dispatch control console incorporated features to allow the console operator to communicate with all hospitals, ambulance drivers, and paramedics over the entire area of operation. The control console also incorporated the use of telephone patching equipment to allow all elements of the Emergency Medical Services System to communicate with each other through two-way radio, microwave, and telephone facilities."

The basic purpose of EMS systems and the applicable FCC Rules and Regulations are reviewed. Descriptions of several communication systems follow including how the various systems address some of the common EMS requirements and problem areas."
 "An effective computer-aided dispatch system has been installed in Caracas, Venezuela, using microcomputers at both ends of a vehicular data system. The resulting system includes many significant features that would probably not be economical had they been executed with random logic design."

 "BY the time April, 1975 rolled around, most of us who are any way connected with microcomputers were up to our ears in papers, articles, and specifications on microcomputers, and inundated with announcements of seminars, conferences, courses, and tutorials on the same subject. Why, then, hold a workshop on \"The Advanced Architecture and Applications of Microcomputers?\""
"The advent of low-cost microcomputer chip sets is having a dramatic impact on the direction of digital design. Except for very cost-sensitive products, most new designs are constructed utilizing programmable logic to replace more conventional random logic designs. The premise of this new logic form is based on the cost savings exhibited by solutions consisting of a small number of different LSI parts over those with many SSI/MSI parts performing the same functions. Low LSI parts costs are achieved by producing functions (e.g., RAM, ROM, processor, and I/O parts) with general utility so that each chip can be manufactured in very high volume. Logic functions are realized by specifying a set of step-by-step instructions which are executed sequentially by the processor."
"Advertisement."
"The advances made in integrated circuit technology to date have been dramatically greater than the uses which have been made of this technology. Initially, the only use of LSI was for the construction of various types of memories. This is an obvious first choice since memories offer both an orderly repetitive pattern, making implementation easy, and a high gate-to-pin ratio, making very large numbers of gates possible on a single chip. The success achieved with memories has caused the processor part of a computer's hardware cost to become increasingly more expensive relative to the memory. As long as the processors are constructed from SSI/MSI units, they will continue to become relatively more expensive as the state of the integrated circuit technology continues to advance. So, a major challenge facing computer designers is to create techniques for utilizing the considerable capability available in LSI technology in the construction of the processing portion of computing systems."

"The technology session of the Asilomar Workshop was oriented mainly towards the constraints of future technologies rather than towards discussing present generally-accepted processes. Four specific areas were highlighted: testing of micro-processors, the future of silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) approaches, the impact of integrated injection logic (I2L), and the role of less-high-density technologies (TTL, ECL, CMOS) in microprocessor development."
"For computers of all sizes, software has become a critical element in systems design and implementation. As dramatically as the costs of hardware have dropped, the labor-intensive costs of software have risen. In addition, there are no widely accepted and practiced techniques for controlling and estimating software development and manufacturing (size) costs, or forecasting software capability and reliability. To be sure, these problems are being addressed by software engineering, but today that is still a very primitive discipline in comparison with other computer engineering fields."
"The main purpose of this session was to explore the future of microprocessors in high-volume consumer markets. Three speakers provided us with prepared talks—Larry Marsh of General Motors, Gamond Schultz of RAMTEK, and Steve Mayer of Atari. Three further impromptu speakers were solicited at the Workshop—Jim Russell of Essex International, Charley Hobbs of Hobbs Associates, and Larry Kuller of CDC."

"Vertical microprogramming (or, as others say, functional microprogramming or firmware) was introduced in contrast with Wilkes' microprogramming (generally called horizontal or structural microprogramming), and has greatly enhanced the use of microprogramming in control design and implementation. As applied today, the former technique is not yet a way of designing control structures, but an additional software level whose implications in the system are not well clarified."
"Microcomputer Systems' new MSM-10X high-density disk storage system features 225 million bytes of storage and a 1.2 megabyte/second transfer rate.

"During recent years the subject of operating systems has received much attention in the computer literature. This is not surprising, since operating systems are the backbone of computer systems, and our understanding of operating systems issues is closely tied to our comprehension of computer science in general. However, most of the available literature deals with theory or with specific implementations. Treatments providing a comparative discussion and analysis of commercial operating system designs are essentially nonexistent. And yet, there is much to be learned from such efforts. It is precisely this observation that motivated this special issue of Computer."
"One of the primary functions of an operating system is to distribute the resources under its control among the users of the system in such a way as to achieve installation standards of performance (including service)."
"As general-purpose computing systems become larger and more complex, it has become uneconomical to restrict their use to a single user or program. This has introduced the necessity of finding ways to safely share them."
"\"Virtual memory\" is a computing term which has come into increasing use in recent years. Unfortunately, like other new expressions, its use often causes controversy and misunderstanding, for it is used to mean different things by different people. Not long ago when one major computer vendor announced the introduction of the new technique of 'virtual storage,' other manufacturers complained that they had been doing the same thing for years under a different name (see Figure 1)."
"This paper focuses on a key issue in operating system design that has hitherto received no explicit attention in the literature–file input/output control logic. Particular attention is concentrated on two well-known systems: the IBM System/360 under OS, and the Burroughs 1700 under the Master Control Program."
"Although continuing cost and performance improvements of the new bipolar and MOS RAM devices are providing strong incentives for their greatly expanded use in mainframe memory and other storage applications, these components have not yet reached the degree of reliability required for large memory systems. Fortunately, however, memory system organization is compatible with a wide variety of low-cost fault detection and correction techniques6,10,11 that go a long way toward compensating for otherwise error-prone systems."

"The great power, versatility, and availability of digital computers and processors has led to an explosive growth of interest in digital signal processing. Several very good books have been written on this subject (for example, see Oppenheim and Schafer<sup>1</sup>and Rabiner and Gold<sup>2</sup>). These presentations are basically classical signal processing adapted to digital processing techniques. As such, the only orthogonal functions considered are the Fouier transformations. However, a rather large body of literature has appeared in recent years suggesting that non-sinusoidal orthogonal transformations may be more useful in a number of digital signal processing applications. In this book, Ahmed and Rao fill a long-felt need to assemble and condense this material into a coherent presentation for the graduate engineering student as well as a body of introductory material for the practicing engineer."

"Among the performance characteristics of programs, the patterns of memory references they generate have the unique property of being totally irrelevant in a non-virtual memory context and perhaps the most important aspect of program behavior in a virtual memory system. It is because of their importance in the latter case that the referencing behavior is so often referred to as the \"behavior\" par excellence."
"During the past several years a considerable amount of effort has gone into the measurement, analysis, and modeling of program behavior. Most of the work either assumes the existence of a reference string, which is then used in various ways, or attempts to produce a model for the process by which such reference strings are generated. With very few exceptions the reference strings that have been measured characterize virtual memory utilization, reflecting the fact that the motivating force behind these research activities is the desire to understand the behavior of virtual memory paging systems."
"To analyze or simulate an operating/computer system, one must construct a model of the programs executing within the system. Many recent analyses, particularly queueing models, have used mathematically convenient program models. For example, in one popular model the times between page faults are assumed to be exponentially distributed and independent. However, such a program model is inaccurate, which may cause the analysis to be unrepresentative of the real world. Simulation models of systems, on the other hand, have relied largely on traces of actual programs. Such traces are undoubtedly more accurate than simple mathematical models, but they have several drawbacks. They are expensive to generate, they may not be truly representative of typical programs, and they may contain more detail than is necessary for accurate system modeling. Moreover, it is difficult to extrapolate their behavior to other similar programs."
"No application programmer writes machine-language programs–i.e., strings of ones and zeroes. That primitive pursuit has long been reserved for those few who create the very first modules of a software system for new hardware. Instead, programmers make use of a wide spectrum of symbolic programming languages, ranging from assembly code to high-level languages such as Fortran, Cobol, and the Algol family. Every programming language has semantics which define some abstract machine. For the assembly-language programmer this machine bears a great resemblance to the actual hardware on which the program will be interpreted, but even here the programmer will frequently use system-defined subroutines or macros which represent extensions of the base hardware facilities. The high-level language programmer's abstract machine reflects the control mechanisms and data structures characteristic of the language. The Fortran programmer, for example, can think in terms of multidimensional array structures, DO loops, subprogram facilities, and so on. In principle he need never be concerned with the manner in which his abstract Fortran machine is to be realized by a particular hardware and software system. The user of a modern electronic hand calculator needs no knowledge of the works inside the box, and a modern high-level language system should present to its users an equally consistent environment, completely defined in terms of the syntax and semantics of the source language."

"Virtual memory is one of the major concepts that has evolved in computer architecture over the last decade. It has had a great impact on the design of new computer systems since it was first introduced by the designers of the Atlas computer in 1962. A virtual memory is usually divided into blocks of contiguous locations to allow an efficient mapping of the logical addresses into the physical address space. In this paper, we are concerned with paging systems, that is, systems for which the blocks of contiguous locations are of equal size. The memory system consists of two levels: main memory and auxiliary memory. The occurrence of a reference to a page that is currently not in main memory is called a page fault. A page fault results in the interruption of the program and the transfer of the referenced page from auxiliary to main memory."
"The practical objective of program behavior studies is to enhance program and system performance. On the one hand, the knowledge resulting from these studies may be useful in designing new programs and new virtual memory systems that are capable of levels of performance higher than those currently achievable. On the other hand, such knowledge may often be employed to increase the performance of existing programs and systems."

"This book is a first student text for a course that might be titled \"Introduction to Data Processing Systems.\" As such, the book attempts to cover a broad range of topics. The following summary gives an idea of this coverage. Chapters 1 and 2 provide an historical introduction to stored-program computers with examples of first-, second-, and third-generation machines. The distinctions among hardware, software, and firmware are also introduced. Chapter 2 continues with the functional organization of an EDP system and a discussion of the CPU, main memory, secondary memory, and input/output devices. Chapter 3 covers data representation and coded character sets for various media. Chapter 4 deals with input/output media, and Chapter 5 gives the characteristics of magnetic core storage, semiconductor storage, magnetic drums, and magnetic disks. Chapter 6 considers the CPU and floating-point representation of numbers. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss input/output operations and devices. Chapter 9 mentions minicomputers and microcomputers and introduces the notion of a flowchart. Chapters 10 and 11 introduce techniques for program construction. Structured programming, instruction modification, and address modification are considered as programming techniques. Programming languages including machine language, symbolic language, and such high-level programming languages as Fortran, WATTIV, Cobol, PL/I, PL/C, Basic, APL, and RPG are discussed. Data bases are covered in Chapter 13. Operating systems and Job Control Language are covered in Chapter 14. In Chapter 15, the author considers system concepts such as multiprogramming, multiprocessing, real-time operation, timesharing operation, and virtual storage concepts."

"If predictions about the future were as easy to come by as judgments about the past, the set of papers I organized for this 25th Anniversary issue might well have focused on the next 25 years—particularly since other papers in this issue deal with the corresponding past quartercentury. But predicting the future is always a chancey business, and trying to look 25 years into the future of our fast-moving industry is a long shot indeed. So, sacrificing symmetry for caution, we have focused most of our attention on the nearer term."
"About the title: in the early days of the computer industry acronyms seemed to pop up everywhere. Their disappearance in these days of emphasis on corporate image is lamentable. This paper uses an acronym, a familiar set of letters, not only to pay tribute to tradition but because \"SOS\" has the right sound and sets the right mood. Thoughts about the future are speculative, and any speculation is a matter of opinion. Hence, this Speculative, Opinionated Scenario (SOS). Any SOS reveals that the sender is basically optimistic about society, is confident that the world will go on, and is concerned about continuing to participate. This particular SOS is basically optimistic about the role of information processing in society, is confident of its future growth, and is concerned about the long-term outlook for the information industry."
"When I talk about a subject like this one, I find myself discussing a world in which one hand is filled with ill-defined problems while the other hand overflows with solutions in search of a problem, a world in which the only thing wrong with a solution is the problems it creates. It is this world I want to talk about, not whether we can build electronic note pads, read our newspaper on a video screen, or get mail via a data net. We can build, at a reasonable cost, almost anything we want. Only recently has our problem become one of what to do with a product after it is built."

"When the IEEE Computer Society was founded twentyfive years ago, the transistor was a laboratory curiosity, and operating computers were assembled from relays or vacuum tubes. Today, a single integrated circuit far surpasses the capability of those early computers, and further progress seems inevitable. The development of semiconductor devices has depended upon a synergism with computers. This is particularly true for integrated circuits, whose development was motivated by the computer applications. With each advance in components, the computers resulting from their use reached a wider market, motivating further advances in the semiconductor technology."

"Twenty-five years ago computers were a collection of boxes in a room, with input, output, memory, and central processor. Programs could be stored and manipulated just like data. Although computers in those days were used mostly for numerical calculations, it was clear that the sorting functions could be used for non-numerical applications. The notion of higher-level languages was around. Some of the hardware utilized transistors (although perhaps point contact germanium); and punched cards and drums were common. Magnetic core memeory and magnetic tape were being developed. The boxes in the computer room had lots of switches and lights, and the people manipulating these were clearly of an elite (if not yet quite professional) class."

"This volume is the latest in the now familiar series of State of the Art Reports by Infotech International Ltd., and follows the format successfully established in earlier reports (see review B76-1, Computer, January 1976). The heart of the report consists of the full text of some 20 invited papers. These are preceded by a 130- page analysis section consisting of key extracts from the invited papers and extracts from discussions held at the Infotech Conference on Structured Programming. The extracts are skillfully linked together with editorial comments in a framework designed to bring out the essential points and arguments in an easily readable and digestible analysis. The analysis section is divided into the following sections: Overview, Complexity in Programming, and Reliability and Correctness. The overview section deals with topics such as the meaning and aims of structured programming, the sequencing mechanisms, languages for structured programming, and issues of performance. The section on complexity in programming deals with human limitations and program modularization aspects. The reliability and correctness section deals with the nature of software reliability and the various approaches to software correctness. The report concludes with a select 76-item annotated bibliography by C. V. Ramamoorthy and H. M. So, covering key papers of historical, introductory, and research interest. An extensive cumulative subject index and bibliographic indices are also provided."

"Integrated injection logic or merged transistor logic is a novel bipolar circuit design approach to achieve high-density large-scale integration. As the basic logic units it uses multicollector npn transistors which are powered from merged multicollector lateral pnp transistors. I2L can be fabricated with standard buried collector technology and is therefore compatible with conventional bipolar circuitry on the same chip. The feature of having special interface circuitry—digital and/or linear—on the same chip renders I2L a powerful LSI technique."

"During the last decade we have seen a dramatic increase in the complexity of silicon integrated circuit chips, particularly in memory. The n-channel FET technology is dominant in main memory and in lower performance logic and arrays (i.e., read-only memory and buffers) because of its higher circuit density and simpler processing, whereas bipolar transistor technology dominates for high-performance logic and arrays."
"The introduction of computers which have user alterable microprograms presents users with both an opportunity and a problem.

 "The term architecture as originally applied to computer systems referred to that part of the computer system which is visible to the programmer–i.e., the instruction set, interrupt characteristics, etc. As such, the computer architecture field has seen few advances in the past several years. Among computer architectures as different as the Burroughs B6700 and the IBM System/370 there is no clear advantage of one relative to another. Performance is determined much more by the circuit technology and the memory size and technology than by the peculiarities of the instruction set. The same situation appears to exist in minicomputers (e.g., the PDP-11 and HP-3000). Although no microprocessor using a stack architecture is known to this writer, it seems unlikely that such a CPU would have unique characteristics. Therefore in setting up the Lake Arrowhead Workshop session on Latency Cost and Architecture it seemed unprofitable to spend time investigating computer architecture in the classical sense. Computers will very likely \"look\" the same in the foreseeable future as they do now."
"Recently, three types of memories have been proposed as possible main memory extensions and replacements for head per track disks or drums; these are CCD, bubble, and BEAMOS memories.1,2,3The extent to which these memories come into widespread use will depend on such factors as cost, performance, reliability, maintainability and profitability. In this paper, potential areas of application for these memories are examined and some of the conditions which must be met for the memories to be economically attractive are determined for systems employing both a single job stream and multiprogrammed job streams."
"Session II of the 1975 Lake Arrowhead Workshop on \"Advances in Storage for Minis and Micros\" was devoted to low-cost tape devices. This article presents a summary of the discussions in that session. No attempt is made to present an all-inclusive coverage of low-cost tape devices, nor necessarily to present a balanced picture, but rather to present the actual material discussed at the workshop. As a result, several types of low-cost tape devices presently on the market are not covered. However, the unique gathering of individual practitioners in the field made this session a lively one, and the article that grew out of it represents a collection of insights that are not likely to be found elsewhere."
"The first six years of the seventies have been a period of rapid developments in the field of rotating memory. Innovation has dominated the gamut of disk drive applications. For example, substantial inroads have been made by flexible disks into the low-entry-cost area where rotating memory was previously not competitive. Cartridge disk drives have gained dramatically in capacity and performance while prices have remained relatively steady. The announcement of the IBM 3340, Winchester, brought to the marketplace the concept of a pack with its own captive heads in order to obtain large capacity at modest cost by increased surface storage density. The IBM System 32 brought the concept of the \"disk enclosure\" which treats a substantial part of a disk system as a field replaceable component. Independent disk manufacturers have responded to the latter two IBM developments with their versions of modest-cost, high-capacity, replaceable media drives and with very low cost, fixed-disk systems."

"Cyclic memories are memories in which data rotate cyclically past a read/write port. The most common cyclic memories in use today are mechanical drums and fixed-head disks. In the past, small electronic cyclic memories have been made from MOS technology; more recently they have been made from charge-coupled devices and magnetic bubbles. Because of advances in integrated technology, large electronic cyclic memories that might be replacements for drum and disk memories are likely to become available. Whereas it is difficult to predict what technology will eventually emerge for electronic auxiliary memories, present projections suggest that cyclically organized memories based upon magnetic bubbles or charge-coupled devices are potential candidates. The disadvantage of cyclic organization is that access time due to memory latency may be excessive. The problem we investigate in this paper is how to modify electronic cyclic memories in relatively minor and inexpensive ways so as to decrease rotational latency in a system environment."

"Graphic terminals allow on-line interaction between the user and his program, thereby enabling him to alter the displayed picutre according to his requirements. However, a major problem with the use of a graphic terminal is the cost associated with it. There is no doubt that low-cost graphic terminals are available, but their utility is very limited since they have no processing capability (or intelligence) and must depend on a host processor attention, while at the same time putting additional strain, on the resources of the host machine. This naturally degrades the response time, depending on the processor load at that time, On the other hand, graphic terminals which have local processing capability are very expensive. With the availability of microprocessors, it is now possible to resolve this delemma: a reasonable amount of intelligence can be added to the terminal at a very reasonable cost.

"The spectrum of a frequency-limited periodic wave may be obtained rapidly by measuring its truncated Walsh spectrum, and then converting from Walsh spectrum to Fourier spectrum after the measurement. The conversion process consists of a matrix multiplication in which a measured Walsh spectrum vector, of dimension 2k, is multiplied by a 2kX 2kconversion matrix that is compensated for Walsh-spectrum truncation, to yield the corresponding Fourier spectrum vector. The microprocessor is well suited to this end; it is also useful in monitoring instrument panel switches and driving a display and print-out. This paper compares available microprocessors from the viewpoint of BCD processing—and concludes that the Fairchild PPS25 processor is the one best suited to meet the requirements."
"Since their invention in 1970 by Boyle and Smith,1,2charge-coupled devices (CCD's) have evolved rapidly and are finding wide-ranging applications in three major areas: imaging, memory, and analog signal processing. In this papers, we will primarily concentrate on the memory applications of CCD's."
"Until recently, electronically addressable devices such as ferrite core, plated wire, semiconductor memories, and electromechanically addressable devices such as magnetic tapes, disks, and drums were the few technologies from which a computer system designer could build a memory system. A number of different new technologies and devices have been developed that close the \"access gap\"14between the two dissimilar technologies mentioned above. These include charge-coupled devices (CCD's),2bubble memories,4electron beam addressed memories (EBAM),17and domain tip propagation (DOT).16Other technologies like CMOS1and integrated injection logic (I2L),9compete directly with the existing technologies. Table 1 (see p. 46) shows the possibility of a six-level hierarchy and some cost and performance projections for these technologies."

No specialized background is required—hence it could be used as a text in an introductory undergraduate course in logic circuits. However, the lack of adequate problem sets detracts from such a use. On the other hand, the book could be used effectively as a text in a second course devoted to a study of digital subsystems such as counters, registers, and other frequently encountered circuits. These points will be developed in the following paragraphs."

"During the past fifteen years, there has been a considerable growth of interest in problems of pattern recognition. This interest has created an increasing need for theoretical methods and experimental software and hardware for use in the design of pattern recognition systems. A number of books have been published on this subject,1-16and some special pattern recognition machines have been designed and built for practical use. Applications of pattern recognition include character recognition,12target detection, medical diagnosis, analysis of biomedical signals and images, remote sensing, identification of human faces and fingerprints, reliability,17socio-economics,18speech recognition and understanding,19and machine parts recognition."
"Pattern recognition is not a new subject. Its principles and methodologies have influenced the course of technological development for many years in almost every knowledge-based field. To some fields, pattern recognition is a major tool for problem- solving, capable of producing dramatic results. To others, it has been accompanied by failure and disappointment. Despite the mixed results, however, pattern recognition has continued to be a fascinating field of research and development in its own right. This is evidenced by the growing list of activities, academic and industrial alike, relating to pattern recognition work."
 "The development of techniques for the computer analysis of pictures and scenes began over 20 years ago.

However, many of the techniques and algorithms, even if developed for a particular application, are also applicable in other areas."

"In its constant endeavor to increase the number of functions per semiconductor device, the semiconductor industry has focused continual effort on developing new semiconductor processes and photolithographic technologies and on compressing smaller geometries onto increasingly larger silicon chip areas. The result is that the number of functions (components per chip) is approximately doubling every year while the cost per function is decreasing. A byproduct of these improvements is increased system reliability. By increasing chip complexity above a few hundred gates, generally referred to as large-scale integration, the capability of economically producing new devices and systems for new applications is being realized."

"Today's increasing emphasis on simulation of continuous dynamic systems lends a special significance to this issue of Computer. Hybrid computers, with their tremendous computing speed resulting from the all-parallel configuration of their analog subsystem, are particularly suited for dynamic system simulation. Indeed, back in the 1950's analog computers were the only game in town when it came to real-time simulation of flight vehicles. Digital computers of that era were simply too slow in the numerical solution of differential equations."
"In contrast to the crude analog-digital combinations of the 1960's, today's hybrids are true multiprocessors supported by realtime operating systems. Their solid-state analog computing elements loaded digitally in microseconds, together with their equation-oriented compilers, provide efficient, automatic setup and high productivity. Teamed with flexible, low-cost alphanumeric/graphic displays, modern hybrids are being applied over the full spectrum of scientific and engineering studies. Since the average hybrid system has an equivalent digital processing speed of over 10 million operations per second, at less than one-tenth the cost of large digital data processors, typical users realize cost savings of over 100/1."
"Advertisement."
"To understand and appreciate the various software requirements for a hybrid computer system one must first understand the environment in which the system is used. It may perhaps also be useful to trace the evolution of the analog computer to the hybrid computer–specifically as hardware developments directed software developments."
"For many years it has been claimed that analog and hybrid computers have a sizeable speed advantage over digital computers in the solution of differential equations. This speed advantage has, in fact, been documented for a number of specific studies, where direct comparisons with all-digital solutions have shown reduced run times and resulting cost savings using analog or hybrid computers. The purpose of this paper is to present a quantitative method of speed comparison that is quite general and allows direct speed comparisons between specific analog and digital computers. The method is based on previous reports written by the authors.1,2Ability to make such speed comparisons is particularly important at this time when faster and faster digital computers are being marketed at generally lower prices."
"Simply defined, a hybrid computer is the sophisticated combination of a real-time interrupt-oriented digital computer with one or more parallel analog processors. Each device is used so as to exploit its own best advantage toward the orderly, rapid solution of the problem at hand in a synergistic manner. This typically involves the preparation and use of mathematical models that dynamically describe the system being studied, using both algebraic and differential relations."

"In introducing the concept of an advanced hybrid computer system it is appropriate to describe briefly the current-generation hybrid system from which the advance is being made. The true significance of the advanced system can then be appreciated–namely that it retains all the advantages and at the same time removes the short-comings of the present generation of hybrid computers."

"During the past 10 years, there has been a considerable growth of interest in the problems of applying computer graphics techniques to practical use. This interest has created an increasing need for the applications of theoretical computer graphics methods to software and hardware systems that are cost-effective as well as user-oriented. A number of books have been published on the subject of computer graphics, and some rather cost-effective graphics devices have been designed and built for practical use. The latter has mainly been the result of microminiaturization technology of the last five years. Microprocessors, microcomputers, and microprogrammability have helped considerably in making cost-effective display devices a reality, the intelligence of such devices being limited only by the capability of the microprocessors. Applications of computer graphics have steadily increased in such areas as engineering, design, education, medicine/biomedicine, chemistry, business, analysis, computer-aided design, management, structural design, simulation, and communication."

"There are many business applications which fit far better the terminology and techniques of industrial control than they do that of conventional data processing. A dealer in any commodity whose price is continually fluctuating, be it money, stocks, or physical supplies, requires real-time information about the deals of his colleagues and competitors and the state of the market: he requires on-stream processing of this continually changing information against an on-line file system of historic data acquired about the market. His communication needs are best satisfied by interaction through visual displays even though his data processing requirements are those generally associated with small batch-processing EDP machines."
"As has often been stated, a business of any size can be considered as a general system,8,11,13,28,29,20,31with identifiable external inputs and outputs typically consisting of goods, services, energy, money, and information. Internally, a business consists of several interacting parts which may be considered as subsystems, each of which has inputs from external sources or from other subsystems and outputs to external sinks or to other subsystems. Usually, each subsystem requires information as an input and, in turn, generates information as an output. As a business becomes larger and more complex, the need for information becomes greater and more critical."

"Universities are often criticized for being too academic–too far removed from society's real problems. One reason for this remoteness is the academic preoccupation with analysis, despite the fact that the solution to many practical problems requires synthesis or invention. Another reason–and this is the one to be discussed here–is that faculties in science and engineering by and large are interested in the science of technology, and devote little or no time to teaching the economics of technology. That is, they teach fundamental principles, and explain how those principles are embodied in particular technologies; but they do little or nothing to explain the extent to which those technologies are produced, distributed, and consumed by and for society.1 For example, a physics department may teach both thermodynamics and nuclear engineering gineering; but it is unlikely to have a course which quantitatively describes trends in the sources and uses of energy and power and in the cost of power generation and distribution. Similarly, in computer science we have courses in numerical calculus, programming languages, and switching theory; but there is no plan to teach the student where computers are used, what functions they perform, or what it costs to write a program, operate a computer center, or manufacture a processor."

 "The application of microprogramming in present day computers is rapidly increasing and microprogramming will undoubtedly play a major role in the next generation of computer systems. Microprogram optimization is one way to increase efficiency and can be crucial in some applications. Optimization, in this context refers to a reduction/minimization of control store and/or execution time of microprograms. The numerous strategies are classified under four broad categories: word dimension reduction, bit dimension reduction, state reduction, and heuristic reduction. The various techniques are presented, analyzed, and compared. Unfortunately, the results of the survey are not too positive. The reason is that much of the work on optimization has been devoted to obtaining the absolute minimum solutions rather than \"good engineering reductions.\" Whether the reduction is being performed with respect to the word dimension, the bit dimension or the number of states existing techniques to obtain the optimum solution use exhaustive enumeration. Thus, the effort involved is prohibitive and there are no guarantees that significant reductions can be obtained. It is thus doubtful that an optimum solution can be justified even when the microcode produced is frequently executed. Heuristic reduction techniques do not guarantee an optimum solution but can provide some reduction with little effort. For the majority of the techniques studied, much further work remains to be done before any practical applications can be foreseen. Some methods however constitute steps in the right directions. Directions for future research are briefly outlined in the conclusions."
"An approach to the development of correct microprograms is to use the methodologies that have been beneficial in the generation of correct user programs, i. e., structured programming, high-level languages (HLL's), and formal program verification using Floyd's inductive assertion method. This paper presents a system that combines these techniques to simplify the design and implementation of correct microprograms for a real microprogrammable computer. It gives some statistics which support our emphasis on generation as well as correctness and some preliminary results on the use of our system."
"We consider the problem of automatic identification of parallel microoperations in a given straight-line microprogram. Earlier work on this problem generally falls into two categories. While some work is fairly general in that it can be applied to both monophase and polyphase systems, it does not guarantee optimality of the output. Work in the second category attempts to optimize the output, but is restricted in application to monophase microprograms."
"Detection of concurrently executable microoperations is an important consideration for effective horizontal microprogramming. Since it is highly machine-dependent and requires knowledge of highly intricate features of a machine, only limited effort has been made so far to derive an algorithm for detection of microprogram parallelism to enable optimization of horizontal microprograms."
"The structure of microprogrammed processors is largely determined by the state of (semiconductor) technology and the requirements of the task of emulation. We discuss the impact of LSI components on microprogrammable processors and in particular, the effect of large memory arrays, LSI microprocessors (bit-slices), programmable logic arrays, and high-speed shifters."
"This paper presents fundamental results about how zero-curvature (paper) surfaces behave near creases and apices of cones. These entities are natural generalizations of the edges and vertices of piecewise-planar surfaces. Consequently, paper surfaces may furnish a richer and yet still tractable class of surfaces for computer-aided design and computer graphics applications than do polyhedral surfaces."
"Approximation of noisy data in the plane by straight line or elliptic or single-branch hyperbolic curve segments arises in pattern recognition, data compaction, and other problems. A number of questions concerning the efficient search for and approximation of data by such curves are examined. Recursive least-squares linear curve fitting is applied to the original or to transformed data in the plane to provide computationally simple algorithms for sequentially searching out appropriate data points and fitting straight line segments or quadratic arcs to the data found. The error minimized by the algorithms is interpreted. Central processing unit (CPU) times for estimating parameters for fitting straight lines and quadratic curves are determined and compared. CPU time for data search is also determined for the case of straight line fitting. Quadratic curve fitting is shown to require about six times as much CPU time as does straight line fitting. Curves relating CPU time and fitting error are determined for straight line fitting. A number of the preceding results are extended by using maximum likelihood curve estimation, and the modification of the classical least-squares curve fit resulting from the use of an a priori probability density function for the unknown curve parameters is determined."
"The object of this paper is the presentation of a theory of decomposition of Boolean functions having the following properties: 1) ease of understanding and application without previous decomposition theory background; 2) flexibility of application to meet varying logic design criteria; 3) suitability of both numerical calculation and chart techniques; and 4) reduction in the number and complexity of calculations required to achieve decomposition."

"Many of the modulo arithmetics can be considered as cyclic groups. A generalized method for implementing the cyclic groups is established based on a decomposed mapping approach. In order to obtain efficient implementation of cyclic groups, certain mapping relations and a proper binary encoding method are investigated. Furthermore, a new class of code, called the circulative code, is developed, and two methods for generating such a code are presented. Various modulo arithmetic units can then be easily designed through a unique formula and can also be machine implemented. The modulo arithmetic units using this design approach are usually simpler than those conventional ones."
"The parallel scheduling of a partially ordered set of tasks has received great attention. The partially ordered tasks can be viewed as components of a straight-line program. In this note, we discuss some aspects of the nonpreemptive parallel scheduling of a program with more general control structures. We examine the existence of optimal k-processor schedules, and in line with recent interest in the complexity of computer computations and algorithms, we study the complexity of constructing optimal k-processor schedules. In particular we show that, for every k > 1, any algorithm that would yield an optimal k-processor schedule of a loop-free program, when such a schedule exists, will be of exponential-time complexity."
"The design of a high-speed, high-accuracy floating-point digital differential analyzer (DDA) system is described. The advantages of a floating-point system are expounded. It is shown that the problem of module interconnection can be alleviated using matrix methods, and a practical implementation of a multiplexed system with a semiconductor fast data storage area is described."
"When a specific type of network is required, the function to be realized limits the amount of fault tolerance that can be achieved. Parameters of functions that affect the maximum obtainable fault tolerance and the maximum obtainable diagnosability are investigated for several types of combinational memoryless) networks."
"A high-fidelity video digitizer/processor extracts spatial and gray-scale information from high resolution dynamic video imagery. The 15-MHz bandwidth 60/s images(fields) are low pass filtered to minimize aliasing and digitized in real-time at 20 million samples pe second (MS/s), 9 bits/sample; sequential fields are transferred to memory, retrieved from memory after computer image processing, and reconstituted at up to 40 MS/s into 60 field/s video of 525, 875, or 1225 lines/frame (two interlaced fields). A/D and D/A converters are synchronized with memory by a high-speed interface, composed of a central data interchange (DI), and 8 rarially connected I/O ports. The DI connects the data paths of one or more ports, each communicating with one or more external devices. Separate 16-bit, 40 megawords/s, input and output data buses between each port and the DI allow data entry through any port to the DI and output from the DI through any port(s), even the same port from which the input originated. The A/D and D/A are served by a single port. Two other ports communicate with CDC 3500 and CDC 1700 computers. Yet another port controls up to two megawords of core/solid-state memory, of which 358K word may be accessed at the full data rate. Storage rates into existing memory of 40 MS/s are achieved for 16-32 ms."
"A memory control unit is described, which, operating in conjunction with a special purpose digital computer, achieves real-time storage into and retrieval from computer memory of individual video images undergoing on-line digitization, processing, and reconstitution. The memory control unit is capable of rapid sequential access on up to six 16 K-word core and two 131 K-word (28-bit word) solid-state memories, achieving data transfers to or from ememory at up to 40 million 9-bit samples/s for 33 ms. The memory control unit employs a variety of data rates, and can, under program control, assemble one or more bytes into, or disassemble one or more bytes from, each memory word. The control unit can sign extend incoming data to any of four different byte lengths from any of four different byte lengths. The control unit possesses dual data busses, one dedicated to memory read operations and a second capable of either \"reads from\" or \"writes into\" memory. The eight memory modules are sequenced by a small microprogrammed control store loadable from an associated computer."
"The present paper discusses a nonsupervised multicategory problem in terms of nonparametric learning. An algorithm for seeking modes of an unknown multidimensional probability density function (pdf) is considered by employing a hypercubic window function. The convergence proof of the algorithm is also presented. The discriminant function for multicategory problems is constructed by using the estimates of the modes of the multimodal pdf. An application of the mode estimation algorithm to nonparametric signal detection is described. The analytical result shows that our machine nearly converges to the optimal machine without supervision."
"It is well known that any switching function may be transformed into a completely symmetric function when repetition of the input variables is allowed. We present an algorithm that may be applied to reduce the number of repeated variables when the transformation is performed. The method is based on an iterative construction of symmetric functions by admitting an increasing number of variables towards a completely symmetric function. The algorithm produces a near minimal number of the total number of inputs in the resultant symmetric function. This algorithm can also be used to determine all partially symmetric variable sets of a given function."
"An algorithm for obtaining simple disjunctive decompositions of fuzzy functions is described. The insufficiency of Boolean methods for simplification of fuzzy functions is discussed. Special properties of the decomposed fuzzy structures are introduced and their relationships to two-valued logic are investigated. This new algorithm is the first one in a containing research in the area of multivalued and fuzzy decompositions of complex systems."
"An algorithm for the realization of an unknown maczine's flow table by preset multiple experiments is given. A method for coding the states of the unknown machine is used to expedite the construction of a partition matrix from which the flow table may be constructed."
"Cellular arrays for arithmetic operations usually consist of identical cells connected in an iterative or near iterative pattern. By introducing latch circuits between the rows of the array, the entire unit can be pipelined. The effect of this modification is to increase the throughput on a continuous processing basis. In most of such designs, however, the amount of hardware required for a maximally or fully pipelined array is prohibitively large. Pipeline arrays with reduced amount of intermediate latch circuits imply partially pipelined designs which of course also have a lower throughput. However, several such pipeline arrays can be operated in parallel to achieve some specified total throughput. In this correspondence this aspect is analyzed and illustrated by the design of 48-bit parallel adders."
"A combinational two-dimensional array for the rapid generation of sines and cosines is described. The array is a spatial realization of a continued product algorithm which uses multiplication by (1 + jEk2-k). Using 10-ns logic, it is estimated that 16-bit sines and cosines may be generated in less than 2 μs."
"The two-layer threshold-element networks with feed-forward connections can be classified into two types, according to whether the inputs are fed directly to the second layer (Type II) or not (Type I). It is shown that there always exists a Type I network (with an appropriate number of elements in the first layer) which realizes the same discriminant function as that of any given Type II network; furthermore, parameters of the Type I network are determined only by that of the Type II network."
"Networks of two input-one output cells are described in which the cells are restricted to realize a subset of the 16 two-variable functions. The restriction, if appropriately chosen, will result in a network whose function set is the same as that of a network of identical structure in which each cell realizes all 16 functions. A restricted network is demonstrated which realizes exactly those functions realized by an irredundant disjunctive network which are dependent on all inputs. In addition, a restriction on cell set size is shown which produces the same functions realized by a general network in which all cells realize 16 functions. From this latter result, it can be concluded that 16 · 7c-1is an upper bound on the number of functions realizable by any network of c cells."
"A unified matrix treatment is presented for the various orderings of the Walsh-Hadamard (WH) functions using a general framework. This approach clarifies the different definitions of the WH matrix, the various fast algorithms and the reorderings of the WH functions."
"The use of charge-coupled devices (CCD's) for pattern recognition applications is discussed. In particular, it is suggested that the new CCD technology may satisfy the large memory, fast processing speed, low cost, small size, and low power requirements which could make practical many pattern processing systems which until now have not been feasible. Specific implementations are suggested along with estimates of processing times."
"The problem of the so-called \"pessimistic\" results, obtained by usingg three-valued (0,1,u) simulation for design verification of digital systems, is discussed. A complete three-valued model for the sequential portion of the digital systems is suggested. The conventional gate model is replaced by the new model, which reduces the problem considerably."
"For many years two-input NAND, AND, NOR, OR and EX-OR gates have been commercially available as cheap quad TTL integrated circuits (IC's). Ideas on quad programmable two-input gates (three inputs per gate) have been published in the literature but have not reached the commercial stage [1]. However, complicated and expensive arithmetic logic units (ALU's) programmable to perform 16 different functions on two 4-bit arguments have become commercially available. The four sections of ALU's are not individually programmable."
"A simplified binary technique is presented for dedecting hazards in combinational and sequential systems. First, a duo-binary representation is developed to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for describing transient and steady-state behavior of switching systems. The results obtained by the duo-binary representation serve to prove that static hazards in switching circuits can be detected by examining only the extreme conditions of the transient signals. Thus, a 1-hazard will appear if the value zero is assigned simultaneously to the changing signals and their complements, and a 0-hazard will appear if the value one is assigned to them."
"Three algorithms are given to construct a weighted r-ary tree with a given set of integer weighted leaves in which the weight of a parent node is 1 + max of its sons. Two goals are of interest; to minimize 1) the weight of the root of the tree, and 2) the number of internal nodes."
"If the addition of a test does not improve the diagdosability of a system the test is called redundant. It is shown that if at least one test is nonredundant, then the previous algorithms to determine the diagnosability [2],[3] can be further improved. It is also shown how and when the diagnosability of a system can be improved by the addition of an extra test."
"Detection of object boundaries is an important step in the analysis of an image. In the presence of a textured background, local edge operators generate many edges that do not correspond to the object boundaries. However, edges along the object boundaries link in elongated segments. An efficient algorithm to perform such linking is described and experimental results of a working program are presented."
"Parzen estimators are often used for nonparametric estimation of probability density functions. The smoothness of such an estimation is controlled by the smoothing parameter. A problem-dependent criterion for its value is proposed and illustrated by some examples. Especially in multimodal situations, this criterion led to good results."
"The synchronous procedure and the asynchronous procedure for the synthesis of a master-slave circuit are examined. It is shown that the synchronous procedure leads to a circuit operating in fundamental mode, while the asynchronous procedure can be performed by taking into account the synchronous flow table. In both cases the same circuit is obtained."
"A simple refinement of Morreale's method yields a useful criterion to identify and cancel the redundant subfunctions generated in the application of the Pi-algorithm. Use of such a criterion improves the efficiency of the algorithm. Extension to multiterminal Boolean functions is also presented."

 "A chronology of computing devices is given. It begins with the abacus and counting tables, and traces the development through desk calculators, analog computers, and finally stored program automatic digital computers. Significant dates relative to the development of the IEEE Computer Society are also given."
"This paper provides a brief overview of significant developments in computer science and engineering education with discussions on curriculum development, continuing education, and certification. Forecasts of industry needs in the 1980's for computer professionals are included, together with the trends in curriculum developments that may auger."
"The programming language field is certainly one of the most important subfields of computer science. It is rich in concepts, theories, and practical developments. The present paper attempts to trace the 25 year development of programming languages by means of a sequence of 30 milestones (languages and concepts) listed in more or less historical order. The first 13 milestones (M1–M13) are largely concerned with specific programming languages of the 1950's and 1960's such as Fortran, Algol 60, Cobol, Lisp, and Snobol 4. The next ten milestones (M14–M23) relate to concepts and theories in the programming language field such as formal language theory, language definition, program verification, semantics and abstraction. The remaining milestones (M24–M30) relate to the software engineering methodology of the 1970's and include a discussion of structured programming and the life cycle concept. This discussion of programming language development is far from complete and there are both practical developments such as special purpose languages and theoretical topics such as the lambda calculus which are not adequately covered. However, it is hoped that the discussion covers the principal concepts and languages in a reasonably nontrivial way and that it captures the sense of excitement and the enormous variety of activity that was characteristic of the programming language field during its first 25 years."
"This paper provides a definition of the term \"software engineering\" and a survey of the current state of the art and likely future trends in the field. The survey covers the technology available in the various phases of the software life cycle—requirements engineering, design, coding, test, and maintenance—and in the overall area of software management and integrated technology-management approaches. It is oriented primarily toward discussing the domain of applicability of techniques (where and when they work), rather than how they work in detail. To cover the latter, an extensive set of 104 references is provided."
"There are many activities included under the category of design automation for integrated circuits. Some of these activities include packaging, placement, routing, interactive graphics, device data bases, and digital simulation; for the purpose of logic verification, timing analysis, and diagnostic test verification. One might also include high-level simulation, such as register transfer simulation, for the purpose of initial logic verification. This paper will be oriented towards modeling and implementation questions which arise when one is attempting to implement an extremely accurate digital simulator for the purposes of logic and design verification and fault simulation. Simulators for these purposes are now extremely important and occupy a major role in any design automation system. These systems are also very expensive and therefore the incorrect answers to a variety of questions which arise during the process of developing such simulators can be disastrous. This paper shall attempt to acquaint the reader with questions that have arisen over the years in terms of developing these simulators and what some of the possible answers are, and their respective tradeoffs. Although the successes, and, equally the failures, of many people have contributed to the present state of the art of digital simulators, one particular simulator, the one the authors are most intimately involved with, will be used as a source of detailed examples demonstrating many of the questions to be discussed."
"The concept of the data utility as a database system capable of supporting a data model, a large-scale on-line store, and concurrent user access has emerged in recent years. New technology can make the notion of database computers—a specialized hardware system for database use—a viable one. A summary of previous activities and a discussion of the state of the art of database computers is given. An attempt is made to suggest guidelines for future database computer architecture research."
"Programmable industrial automation can help meet the socioeconomic needs for increased productivity and job enrichment in labor-intensive industries. Characterized by production flexibility and ease of setup for new products, programmable automation is especially adaptable to manufacturing a variety of products in variable lot sizes at mass-production costs. Programmable, automated hardware/software systems existing in industry today include numerical control of machine tools, computer-aided design and manufacturing, production information and control, and industrial robots. These systems are being advanced by ongoing research and development activities; one major activity entails the application of robots with sensors to material-handling, inspection, and assembly operations. The ultimate goal of programmable automation is an essentially unmanned, computer-integrated automatic factory."
"This paper surveys the state of the art in the design and evaluation of multiprocessing systems. Multiprocessor architectures of the SIMD and MIMD type are reviewed and further classified depending on their tight or loose coupling and their homogeneity. The additional complexity of the software for control, synchronization, efficient utilization, and performance monitoring of multiple processors is emphasized."
"This paper surveys some recent contributions to computer arithmetic. The survey includes floating-point arithmetic, nonstandard number systems, and the generation of elementary functions. The design objective for these areas is computation that is both accurate and fast."
"This review article attempts to give a perspective on the evolution of magnetic recording storage devices, highlight the frontiers of current activity, and address the future of this storage technology. Tape, disk (both rigid and flexible), and mass storage systems are covered. It is of interest to note that digital magnetic recording spans not only the twenty-five year history of the IEEE Computer Society which this issue is recognizing but has during this whole period undergone continual technical advances and widespread growth in usage. It is fair to say that magnetic recording is among the most important technologies in the history of the computer age to date."
"The density of integrated circuits has improved in the last 15 years by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. This paper discusses four primary computer technology areas that have helped bring about this advance and which have significantly changed the nature of computer components: FET logic, FET memory, bipolar logic, and bipolar memory. Projections are made for future trends in these technologies."
"Basic concepts, motivation, and techniques of fault tolerance are discussed in this paper. The topics include fault classification, redundancy techniques, reliability modeling and prediction, examples of fault-tolerant computers, and some approaches to the problem of tolerating design faults."
"This survey article traces the development of analog/hybrid and digital simulation of continuous systems since the early 1950's, describes modern aspects, and discusses future trends."
"This paper discusses progress in the design of graphic displays, as seen from the viewpoint of the graphics system designer. In the first of three parts, the paper outlines the development of line-drawing displays, and explains why attention is presently focused on buffered transformation processors. The second part discusses raster-scan CRT displays, and compares several solutions to the problems of scan conversion and storage for refresh. The third part reviews some issues in the design of new display devices, and relates these to the functional characteristics of the graphic display."
"Data communications has come of age. In this paper, we highlight some of the principal events that led up to the revolution in communications among information processing systems. Perhaps the most important event was the technological development of packet switching in the form of the ARPANET. We devote most of this presentation to a brief summary of the ARPANET experience, emphasizing the description, functions, analysis, design and performance measurement of packet-switching networks. We also discuss some recent advances in radio packet switching for long-haul (i.e., satellite) and terminal-access communications."
"Extensive research and development has taken place over the last 20 years in the areas of pattern recognition and image processing. Areas to which these disciplines have been applied include business (e. g., character recognition), medicine (diagnosis, abnormality detection), automation (robot vision), military intelligence, communications (data compression, speech recognition), and many others. This paper presents a very brief survey of recent developments in basic pattern recognition and image processing techniques."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) joins forces with brain research, cognitive psychology, and linguistics to probe the nature of intelligeice. It is asserted that the current AI emphasis on representation of knowledge will be augmented by increasing attention to cooperative computation and learning. AI also contributes to a man-machine symbiosis: providing specialized packets of intelligence to augment our own. As we augment our intelligence with our machines, building on current success with robotics, scene analysis, language understanding, and expert systems, we must better understand our own intelligence to enable the construction of high-bandwidth man–machine interfaces. This, too, is a form of cooperative computation."
"A law now in effect in the United States requires protection of individual privacy in computerized personal information record-keeping systems maintained by the federal government. Similar laws apply in certain state and local governments. Legislation has also been introduced to extend the requirements for privacy protection to the private sphere. Central in privacy protection are the rights of an individual to know what data are maintained on him, challenge their veracity and relevance, limit their nonroutine use or dissemination, and be assured that their quality, integrity, and confidentiality are maintained. In all computer systems that maintain and process valuable information, or provide services to multiple users concurrently, it is necessary to provide security safeguards against unauthorized access, use, or modifications of any data file. This difficult problem has not yet been solved in the general case. Computer systems must also be protected against unauthorized use, disruption of operations, and physical damage. The growing number of computer applications involving valuable information or assets plus the growing number of criminal actions directed against computer applications and systems or perpetrated by using computers underscore the need for finding effective solutions to the computer security problem. In the future, concerns for privacy and security must become integral in the planning and design of computer systems and their applications."

"THIS Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS is composed of selected papers from the 3rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 1973. Far more high-quality papers have been presented at these conferences erences than can be accommodated in any one journal. However, the interdisciplinary nature of artificial intelligence (AI) means that IJCAI papers regularly appear in several journals."
"This paper describes a theorem prover, running on a PDP-10-Tenex system, that can prove some theorems whose statements involve a relatively large number of definitions. Such theorems require special methods because 1) their statements contain a large number of clauses and 2) their proofs are quite long although straightforward."
"The operation of a deletion-directed search strategy for resolution-based proof procedures is discussed. The strategy attempts to determine the satisfiability of a set of input clauses while at the same time minimizing the cardinality of the set of retained clauses. Distribution, a new clause deletion rule which is fundamental to the operation of the search strategy, is also described."
"A semantic and deductive formal system for automatic theorem proving is presented. The system has, as its deductive component, a form of natural deduction. Its semantic component relies on an underlying representation of a model. This model is invoked to prune subgoals generated by the deductive component, whenever such subgoals test false in the model. In addition, the model is used to suggest inferences to be made at the deductive level. Conversely, the current state of the proof suggests changes to be made to the model, e.g., when a construction is required as in geometry."
"The representation power of goal-subgoal trees and the adequacy of this form of problem reduction is considered. A number of inadequacies in the classical form are illustrated, and two versions of a syntactic procedure incorporating extensions are given. Although the form of the corrections are suggested from resolution theory results, and the value of this connection emphasized, the paper discusses the goal tree format and its extensions on an informal level."
"The problem of converting axioms in predicate calculus to deterministic programs, which are to be used as \"rules\" by a general problem solver (GPS)-type supervisor is considered. It is shown that this can be done, but that the \"objects\" must then contain procedure closures or \"FUNARG-expressions\" which are later applied."
"Newer programming languages for artificial intelligence extend the class of available control regimes beyond simple hierarchical control. In so doing, a key issue is using a model that clearly exhibits the relation between modules, processes, access environments, and control environments. This paper presents a model which is applicable to diverse languages and presents a set of control primitives which provide a concise basis on which one can define almost all known regimes of control."
"Clisp is an attempt to make Lisp programs easier to read and write by extending the syntax of Lisp to include infix operators, IF-THEN statements, FOR-DO-WHILE statements, and similar Algol-like constructs, without changing the structure or representation of the language. Clisp is implemented through Lisp's error handling machinery, rather than by modifying the interpreter. When an expression is encountered whose evaluation causes an error, the expression is scanned for possible Clisp constructs, which are then converted to the equivalent Lisp expressions. Thus, users can freely intermix Lisp and Clisp without ut having to distinguish which is which. Emphasis in the design and development of Clisp has been on the system aspects of such a facility, with the goal of producing a useful tool, not just another language. To this end, Clisp includes interactive error correction and many \"do-what-I-mean\" features."
"A description of techniques used for semantic modeling in a deductive question-answering system is given. The system maintains a dialog and is able to understand situations which can be expressed as a series of sequential time-frames. Specific relevant questions are asked by the system when it is unable to succeed in a given task. It can also provide reasons for its previous actions."
"This paper describes D-Script, a language for representing knowledge in artificial intelligence (AI) programs. D-Script contains a powerful formalism for descriptions, which permits the representation of statements that are problematical for other systems. Particular attention is paid to problems of opaque contexts, time contexts, and knowledge about knowledge. The design of a deductive system for this language is also considered."
"Predicate complement constructions are a rich source of semantic problems. A system for testing the semantic properties (presuppositions and entailments) of predicate complement constructions has been constructed, and, in particular, the implementations of these constructions have been explored in some detail in the context of the tic-tac-toe game-playing setting of Isard and Longuet-Higgins [2] and Davies and Isard [1]. Even in such a limited setting, the implementations of many of these constructions (especially composite predicate complement constructions) are nontrivial, suggesting that such restricted settings provide a good testing ground for many key linguistic problems."
"This paper discusses the architecture of a metasystem, which can be used to generate intelligent information systems for different domains of discourse. It points out the kinds of knowledge accepted by the system, and the way the knowledge is used to do nontrivial problem solving. The organization of the system makes it possible for it to function in the context of a large and expanding data base. The metasystem provides a basis for the definition of the concept of machine understanding in terms of the models that the machine can build in a domain, and the way it can use the models."
"PAS-II, a computer program which represents a generalized version of an automatic protocol system (PAS-I) is described. PAS-II is a task-free, interactive, modular data analysis sis system for inferring the information processes used by a human from his verbal behavior while solving a problem. The output of the program is a problem behavior graph: a description of the subject's changing knowledge state during problem solving. As an example of system operation the PAS-II analysis of a short cryptarithmetic protocol is presented."
"This paper considers various factors affecting system em organization for speech understanding research. The structure of the Hearsay system based on a set of cooperating, independent processes using the hypothesize-and-test paradigm is presented. Design considerations for the effective use of multiprocessor and network achitectures in speech understanding systems ems are presented: control of processes, interprocess communication and data sharing, resource allocation, and debugging are discussed.1"
"This paper describes the structure and operation of the Hearsay-I1speech understanding system by the use of a specific example illustrating the various stages of recognition. The system consists of a set of cooperating independent processes, each representing a source of knowledge. The knowledge is used either to predict what may appear in a given context or to verify hypotheses resulting from a prediction. The structure of the system is illustrated by considering its operation in a particular task situation: Voice-Chess. The representation and use of various sources of knowledge are outlined. Preliminary results of the reduction in search resulting from the use of various sources of knowledge are given."
"Stanford Research Institute (SRI) is participating in a major program of research on the analysis of continuous speech by computer. The goal is the development of a speech understanding system capable of engaging a human operator in a natural conversation about a specific problem domain. The approach being taken is distinctive in the extent to which it depends on syntactic and semantic processing to guide the acoustic analysis. This correspondence provides a description of the first version of the system, emphasizing the kinds of information that need to be added for effective results."
"A ranging system, consisting of a laser, computer-controlled optical deflection assembly, and TV camera, obtains three-dimensional images of curved solid objects. The object is segmented into parts by grouping parallel traces obtained from the ranging system. Making use of the property of generalized translational invariance, the parts are described in terms of generalized cylinders, consisting of a space curve, or axis, and a circular cross section function on this axis."
"The recovery of straight picture edges from digitizations of scenes containing polyhedra (\"line finding\") is central to the functioning of scene analysis programs. While recognizing that recovery properly involves a computational mobilization of a great deal of knowledge-supported context, there remain some basic issues of representation which govern the way in which the primary data—grey levels—are addressed. The paper describes a parametric representation of straight picture edges and its procedural deployment in the recovery of edges from digitizations of scenes whose contents are essentially polyhedra with strong visible shadows."

"One of the desirable properties of a pseudorandom number generator is that the sequence of numbers it generates should have very low autocorrelation for all shifts except for zero shift and those that are multiples of its cycle length. Due to the simple methods of constructing random numbers via modulo arithmetic, the ideal is often not quite fulfilled. The results of this paper were obtained by the simple method of examining the complete correlation structure of several generators of the same type and small cycle length. Once the regularities were discovered, the mathematical relationships were derived which describe the regular behavior for all generators of the same class. As examples, it is shown in this paper that high correlation exists in mixed and multiplicative congruential random number generators and prime moduli Lehmer generators for shifts a fraction of their cycle lengths."
"Given that the autocorrelations for any repeating number sequence are known, this paper gives an algorithm for determining the autocorrelation structure of a new sequence obtained from the original sequence by proper decimation. Therefore, for certain random number generators, it is possible to choose a proper decimation which results in a long interval in which the autocorrelations are small for all shifts."
"Examination of rounding and truncation errors in radix (−2) systems establishes the following facts: 1) truncation error is 33 percent lower than in the positive radix case. 2) There is no 1-bit rounding algorithm. 3) The error bound of the standard (1-bit) positive radix rounding algorithm can be approached asymptotically by using more than one of the discarded bits. For N bits, this error bound is multiplied by 1 + (3. 2N−l)−1."
"A study of architecture for an 8-bit microprogrammed microcomputer (MPM) is presented in this paper. The control memory of this microcomputer is implemented as a dynamic shift-register memory (SRM). It is shown that the use of the SRM simplifies the processor circuits to such an extent that the entire CPU can be placed on a single LSI module. A new type of instruction (the tabled instruction) introduced not only simplifies organization of data exchange between the SRM and the processor, but also allows organizing of complex control sequences. It is shown that some tabled instructions implement the actions which ordinarily are performed by small subroutines of conventional microprogrammed computers. Other features of the MPM are more 1) a powerful set of instructions and 2) greatly simplified programming, since hundreds of processor registers are made available to the programmer."
"Recent advances in multiprogramming have been concentrated on multiprocessor systems. But overlap in operations is also permissible in uniprocessor systems in which the processor instruction execution and input–output operations are handled by separate units. By maximizing the processor and input–output overlap, a program can be executed faster while the system utilization is highly improved."
"The shuffle-exchange network is considered as an interconnection network between processors and memory modules in an array computer. Lawrie showed that this network can be used to perform some important permutations in log2 N steps. This work is extended and a network is proposed that permits the realization of any permutation in 0([mi][/mi]N) shuffle-exchange steps. Additional modifications to the basic. procedure are presented that can be applied to perform efficiently some permutations that were not realizable with the original mechanism. Finally, an efficient procedure is described for the realization of a shuffle permutation of N elements on an array computer with M memory modules where M < N."
"We describe a hierarchic computer procedure for the detection of nodular tumors in a chest radiograph. The radiograph is scanned and consolidated into several resolutions which are enhanced and analyzed by a hierarchic tumor recognition process. The hierarchic structure of the tumor recognition process has the form of a ladder-like decision tree. The major steps in the decision tree are: 1) find the lung regions within the chest radiograph, 2) find candidate nodule sites (potential tumor locations) within the lung regions, 3) find boundaries for most of these sites, 4) find nodules from among the candidate nodule boundaries, and 5) find tumors from among the nodules. The first three steps locate potential nodules in the radiograph. The last two steps classify the potential nodules into nonnodules, nodules which are not tumors, and nodules which are tumors."
"This paper suggests a new method for minimizing the width or bit dimension of control store words in microprogrammed digital computers. It is shown that any given problem can be formulated within the framework of linear programming and that there exists a lower limit CLB to the number of bits. The optimal grouping of subcommands which gives this minimal width is also readily obtainable."
"In this paper, a new algorithm for a cubic spline fit with equally spaced data points and given end conditions is described. It provides a new understanding of how a spline fit works and possesses the following computational advantages: 1) It can solve large size problems (virtually unlimited). 2) The accuracy can be realistically controlled based on the characteristics of data. 3) The computation time-is linearly proportional to the size of the problem. 4) It can handle a localized fit. 4) It can handle a localizd. The new algorithm is particularly suitable to be implemented in minicomputers for cutting surfaces by numerically controlled machines and for other applications."
"A square root of an isotone Boolean function f with respect to a variable xi was defined by Reischer and Simovici [10] as a Boolean function s such that holds identically. More generally, given a partition (T,Y,Z) of the set X = (x1,···,xn) of variables, we may be interested in finding a functional decomposition of the form"

"This correspondence develops efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) programs to transform arrays of dimension N, where N can be written as a power of two possibly multiplied by arbitrary factors. Two programs were developed which use radix-2 and radix-4 transformations for the binary factors. These programs call another subprogram to transform with respect to the arbitrary factors, if any. Since the sequential transformation is well known, the emphasis is on developing an efficient unscrambling procedure to follow the transformation."
"Optimal decision strategies such as Bayes and Neyman-Pearson require the computation of likelihood ratios that are difficult to compute in all but a few special cases. In practice, unfounded assumptions are frequently made about the nature of the pattern classes so that these strategies can be used. In this correspondence suboptimal decision strategies are explored that are attractive because they are easy to compute. These offer two rather unusual advantages. If, during the operation of the classifier a measurement is undefined or too difficult to make, it is easy to alter the dimensionality of the decision rule. Furthermore, it is possible to use different sets of features for testing different classes so that dimensionality can be minimized rather easily. Normally the features used for each class are \"specialists\" in discriminating that class from the mixture of remaining classes."
"The frequency of occurrence of logic functions of binary N-tuples can be observed from sequences of binary patterns. The logic functions considered here are AND, NOR, NAND, OR, and an odd-even parity check; and the frequency parameters are expressed as real matrix transformations on the probabilities of the patterns. Some properties, inverses, and interrelationships among the parameter sets are given, along with fast algorithms to facilitate computational processes. The results permit the outputs of convenient hardware logic operations to be converted into other parameters for smoothing, detection, or inference purposes, or to estimate the pattern probabilities by inversion. A measure of association among binary patterns is given as one characteristic feature which can be derived from the observed parameters."

"A signed modified reflected binary (SMRB) code with unique representability of both positive and negative numbers has been proposed in this correspondence. The bit pattern in this code can be defined in a systematic way leading to a simple synchronous up/down counter. Some arithmetic operations for this code have also been considered."

"THE field of fault-tolerant computing is concerned with the analysis, design, verification, and diagnosis of computing systems that are subject to faults. A \"computing system,\" in this general context, can be a hardware system, a software system, or a computer which includes both hardware and internal software. A \"fault\" can reside in either hardware or software and can occur in the process of designing and implementing the system, or in the process of using the system once it is implemented. Major areas of technical interest include: 1) the design and analysis of computers which are able to execute specified algorithms correctly (according to specified correctness criteria) in the presence of hardware and/or software faults; 2) the testing and verification of the initial correctness of hardware and software systems prior to utilization; 3) the design and implementation of on-line fault detection, fault location, and system reconfiguration procedures that can be used to recover from hardware and software faults, to perform system maintenance, and to maintain security; and 4) the development of models, measures, and techniques for evaluating the reliability, availability and, in general, the effectiveness of fault-tolerant computing systems."
"The experimental fault-tolerant memory system described in this paper has been designed to enable the modular addition of spares, to validate the theoretical fault-secure and self-testing properties of the translator/corrector, to provide a basis for experiments using the new testing and correction processes for recovery, and to determine the practicality of such systems. The hardware design and implementation are described, together with methods of fault insertion. The hardware/ software interface, including a restricted single error correction/double error detection (SEC/DED) code, is specified. Procedures are carefully described which, 1) test for specified physical faults, 2) ensure that single error corrections are not miscorrections due to triple faults, and 3) enable recovery from double errors."
"The goals of this paper are to present an efficient redundancy scheme for highly reliable systems, to give a method to compute the exact reliability of such systems and to compare this scheme with other redundancy schemes. This redundancy scheme is self-purging redundancy, a scheme that uses a threshold voter and that purges the failed modules. Switches for self-purging systems are extremely simple: there is no replacement of the failed modules and module purging is quite simply implemented. Because of switch simplicity, exact reliability calculations re possible. The effects of switch reliability are quantitatively examined. For short mission times, switch reliability is the most important factor: self-purging systems have a probability of failure several times larger than the figure obtained when switches are assumed to be perfect. The influence of the relative frequency of the diverse types of failures (permanent, intermittent, stuck-at, multiple,...) is also investigated. Reliability functions, mission time improvements, and switch efficiency are computed and displayed. Self-purging systems are compared with other redundant systems, like hybrid or NMR, for their relative merits in reliability gain, simplicity, cost, and confidence in the reliability estimation. The high confidence in the reliability evaluation of self-purging systems makes them a standard for the validation of several models that have been proposed to take into account switch reliability. The accuracy of the models using coverage factors can be evaluated in this way."
"A reliability analysis method for computing systems is considered in which the underlying criteria for \"success\" are based on the computations the system must perform in the use environment. Beginning with a general model of a \"computer with faults,\" intermediate concepts of a \"tolerance relation\" and an \"environment space\" are introduced which account for the computational needs of the user and the probabilistic nature of the use environment. These concepts are then incorporated to obtain a precisely defined class of computation-based reliability measures. Formulation of a particular measure is illustrated and results, applying this measure, are compared with those of a typical structure-based analysis."
"The problem of automatic fault diagnosis of systems decomposed into a number of interconnected units is considered by using a simplified version of the diagnostic model introduced by Preparata et al. The model used in this paper is supposed to be a realistic representation of systems where each unit has a considerable computational capability. For any system of n units whose set of testing links is given, necessary and sufficient conditions for t-diagnosability are presented in both cases of one-step diagnosis and diagnosis with repair, and it is shown that the procedure for diagnosis with repair has very small complexity. The problem of optimal assignment of testing links in order to achieve a given diagnosability is also considered and classes of optimal t-diagnosable systems are presented for arbitrary values of t in both cases of one-step diagnosis and diagnosis with repair."
"A module-level testing approach for combinational networks which employs hardware modification and a simplified test generation procedure is described. The approach is based on a directed graph model for the network derived at the module level. The objectives of the approach are to deal with testing directly at the module level, to use cataloged tests for the modules in the network environment, and to generate a fault detection test set with \"good\" fault location capability. Networks which consist of single-output modules are treated initially and then the results are extended to networks which consist of multiple-output modules. Hardware modification and test generation procedures are illustrated."
"This paper studies the problem of fault detection in iterative logic arrays (ILA's) made up of combinational cells arranged in a one-dimensional configuration with only one direction for signal propagation. It is assumed that a fault can change the behavior of the basic cell of the array in an arbitrary way, as long as the cell remains a combinational circuit. It is further assumed that any number of cells can be faulty at any time. In this way, testing an array is equivalent to verifying the correctness of its truth table. That could be done exhaustively through the application of a set of tests whose size is exponential in N, the number of cells in the array. The procedure presented in this paper generates a test set whose size is constant (i.e., independent of the number N of cells in the array). Conditions (on the structure of the basic cell) for the application of this procedure are presented. A practical example illustrating the application of this procedure is presented. Bounds for the size of the derived test set are presented and it is shown how to modify the basic cell of an arbitrary array in order to test it with a constant number of tests."
"Logic circuits are usually tested by applying a sequence of input patterns S to the circuit under test and comparing the observed response sequence R bit by bit to the expected response Ro. The transition count (TC) of R, denoted c(R), is the number of times the signals forming R change value. In TC testing c(R) is recorded rather than R. A fault is detected if the observed TC c(R) differs from the correct TC c(Ro). This paper presents a formal analysis of TC testing. It is shown that the degree of detectability and distinguishability of faults obtainable by TC testing is less than that obtainable by conventional testing. t is argued that the TC tests should be constructed to maximize or minimize c(Ro). General methods are presented for constructing complete TC tests to detect both single and multiple stuck-line faults in combinational circuits. Optimal or near-optimal test sequences are derived for one-and two-level circuits. The use of TC testing for fault location is examined, and it is concluded that TC tests are relatively inefficient for this purpose."
"This paper describes a logic system specifically designed for fault test generation. The system allows the user to impose a set of initial constraints on the elements of a logic network by indicating those values which an element may (or may not) assume for the test under consideration. He can be as vague or as specific as he wants in imposing these constraints. A set of logic tables is then used to automatically propagate the effects of these constraints throughout the network. As a result of this logic propagtion, the necessary values of the elements in the network become much more precisely (if not completely) defined. The tables also indicate whether or not the generated test (which may include a number of unspecified values) is sufficient to detect the given fault. If several different tests will suffice, the choices remaining are clearly indicated. In the case of a redundant lead (untestable fault), propagation through the tables automatically results in a logical inconsistency."
"A nine-valued circuit model for test generation is introduced which takes care of multiple and repeated effects of a fault in sequential circuits. Using this model test sequences can be determined which allow multiple and repeated effects of faults on the internal state of a sequential circuit. Thus valid test sequences are derived where other known procedures, like the D-algorithm, do not find any test although one exists."
"Several synthesis methods for fail-safe asynchronous sequential machines have been reported recently. All of these methods solve the race problem by using noncritical race state assignments. This approach generally results in large number of state variables, relatively complicated design, and the limitation of single-input change."
"An error-correction code, presented here, uses two redundant tracks and one redundant character which are formed from the askew and the vertical redundancy check (AVRC) bits. The error-correction capability of this code is the same as for the ORC Patel and Hong's code, but the encoded codeblock dimension is not subject to constraints."
"Our purpose is to define a methodology for writing (micro) programs to test CPU's for which no or few test facilities are available."
"This correspondence shows how recursion can be used to simplify testing of combinational circuits. Necessary and sufficient conditions for testing simple iterative arrays (one-dimensional) with a fixed number of tests (independent of the number of cells) are given. Multiple faults and diagnosis in such circuits are also studied. The extension of the concept of simple iteration to complex iteration that may realize more complex recursive functions, is defined. Examples of such complex iterative circuits are studied."
"In digital circuits there is typically a delay between the occurrence of a fault and the first error in the output. This delay is the error latency of the fault. A model to characterize the error latency of a fault in a sequential circuit is presented."
"Fault detection by applying a random input sequence simultaneously to a network under test and to a reference network is conside-red. A distinction between testing quality and detection quality is given. The detection surface is introduced as a characteristic parameter of a combinational network. The results are applied to TTL combinational circuits."

"A concise matrix notation is introduced, leading to a very simple statement of the resolution principle of mechanical theorem proving in the propositional calculus. The refinements of general resolution can also be stated easily using this notation. In addition, the notation has lead to the development of three new techniques of theorem proving which are described and proved complete."
"Paz et al. [1] have revealed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear automaton to be strongly approximable. In this paper, we extend their theory to a linear space automaton [2], i.e., a linear system with more than one linear mapping, to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition that it is strongly stable."
"A method of realizing arbitrary combinational switching functions with multiplexers is derived. These circuits are divided in two classes where the first allows only uncomplemented variables as control inputs and the second has unrestricted inputs. The selected inputs to each multiplexer in the first class of circuits (tree circuits) are shown to be residue functions of the output function. Using this fact, it is demonstrated that many functional properties simplify realization procedures."
"A matrix transform processor (MTP) for an Evans and Sutherland LDS-2 graphics system has been designed and built at the University of North Carolina. The MTP performs all the important functions of a matrix multiplier, clipper, and perspective divider. Because of fast division logic in the MTP, the clipping and perspective division algorithms are straightforward and the machine is quite simple. One processor handles all the functions; it is not necessary to pipeline the processes. The worst-case line processing time is about 10 μs."
"-Real-time optimization of the overall performance of a large computer system or network such as an air-traffic control system or teleprocessing network inherently requires the introduction of adaptive control into selected control functions or sets of control functions. Such adaptive control is necessitated by the high variance of the available resource inventory and the workload resource demands within the system environment. Global management of the resulting multiloop control system becomes the responsibility of the operating system. Investigated aspects of this evolutionary extension of the operating system called the dynamically adaptive operating system (DAOS) include the general methodology and the real-time modeling and estimation of resource demands. The methodology specifies the general identification, decision, and modification processes required for an adaptive operating system. Support of such processes could be attractively provided by a peripheral or miniprocessor. The problem of estimating resource service times both with and without partial service times is explored and statistical models possessing utility for real-time modeling are developed. In particular, a dynamically partitioned second moment model (DPSMM) is described. The feasibility of such models is established with respect to a General Principle of Locality. Selected simulation results are presented to evaluate selected developments with respect to an adaptive central processing unit (CPU) scheduling discipline."

"This work is devoted to the analysis of page replacement algorithms under assumptions on the stochastic nature of the sequence of memory accesses. A detailed discussion of the authors' results, some of which were published in Russian, and their relations to other papers is given. The object of study of this paper is two families of page replacement algorithms (PRA's) which contain certain algorithms of practical and theoretical interest. Analytical results are derived using the assumption that the references to the pages are independent identically distributed (iid) random variables. The algorithms of the first family are intervening between FIFO and LRU and the algorithms of the second family estimate the most frequently referenced pages considerably better than LRU. Explicit expressions of the page fault probabilities are obtained for these families and least upper bounds of performance are established which are independent of the page request probabilities. It is shown that for the second family the fault probabilities are less than twice the optimal one."
"A differential current-switching circuit configuration is proposed for implementing threshold logic, and a first-order statistical analysis of the configuration is described. The configuration is intended for use within functional digital integrated circuits. It can be realized in a form that is fully compatible with conventional emitter-coupled logic (ECL)."
"In this correspondence, error analysis for two-dimensional direct form recursive digital filters employing floating-point arithmetic is carried out. A systematic way of estimating the mean-squared errors due to roundoff, coefficient, and input quantizations is discussed. Norm error bounds are also given. Extensive numerical experiments have shown that the present approach leads to satisfactory results."

"A simplified version of Aho and Ullman's algorithm [1] is presented for the elimination of unit productions of the form A::= B from LR(k) parsers. The algorithm does not eliminate all such unit productions, but it is applicable in practical instances not handled by Aho and Ullman's technique."
"Ahmed has shown that a discrete cosine transform can be implemented by doing one double length fast Fourier transform (FFT). In this correspondence, we show that the amount of work can be cut to doing two single length FFT's."
"In the above paper1Edwards shows the implementation of several Boolean functions using a threshold gate and XOR gates. An unstated, but implicit, result is that any given Boolean function can be synthesized in this way. This result is of some historical interest. We wish to relate it to a previous paper by Kaplan and Winder [1], which in effect derived the result, and then to a mathematical study of Lawson [2], [3], which yields a synthesis procedure with very general applicability."

"In the above paper1Yang has expounded a concept of supersession and has claimed that superseded compatibles can be ignored in the process of minimizing incompletely specified sequential machines (ISSM). In this correspondence, we present a counterexample whose minimal solution must include a superseded compatible and not the superseding compatible. As a consequence of this it is evident that Yang's theory lacks generality."

"Automated theorem proving involves the programming of computers to perform logical (mathematical) deduction. This should not be confused with numerical calculation, in which operations that need to be performed can be exactly specified ahead of time as, for example, in Gaussian elimination. Rather, theorem provers search for proofs of statements given axioms describing the basic assumptions such as would occur in a modern algebra text on group theory. There are many theorem-proving programs that are based on ad hoc data representations and manipulations;many such techniques are derived by the programmer analyzing how he himself proves theorems. However, the most widely studied and best understood general method is based on the resolution principle for first-order logic of Robinson [9]. Indeed, all the papers in this issue have resolution as a starting point."
"The two objectives of this paper are 1) to give a large and varied problem set, complete clause sets for use in testing automated theorem-proving programs and 2) the presentation of a number of experiments with an existing program under a variety of conditions."
"This paper describes a comparative study of six binary inference systems and two search strategies employed in resolution-based problem solving systems. A total of 152 problems, most of which were taken from the recent literature, were employed. Each of these problems was attempted under a standard set of conditions using each inference system and each search strategy, for a total of twelve attempts for each problem. Using a variety of performance measures, a large number of hypotheses were examined in an effort to provide insight into the behavior of each inference system/search strategy combination. Whenever possible, the authors employed distribution-free statistical tests to minimize the subjectivity of the comparisons and hypothesis testing. Conclusions are presented concerning the effectiveness of the binary inference systems and search strategies, some effects of employing different problem representations, and certain characteristics of problems found to be significant in the overall system performance. Suggestions are made as to additional techniques that might enable theorem provers to solve practical problems."
"Occurrences of literals in the initial clauses of a refutation by resolution (with each clause-occurrence used only once) are mated iff their descendants are resolved with each other. This leads to an abstract notion of a mating as a relation between: occurrences of literals in a set of clause-occurrences. The existence of many refutations with the same mating leads to wasteful redundancy in the search for a refutation, so it is natural to focus on the essential problem of finding appropriate matings."
"In, this paper we argue that if search procedures are to use problem-specific information to direct a search, then they must have complete control over the deductive process. This includes the freedom to select any pair of clauses to interact as well as the freedom to select the literals upon which to attempt the interaction. We give examples to indicate the nature of inference rules which are incompatible with such search procedures. We then present a framework for a search procedure to indicate where problem-specific information may be utilized. Finally, we augment the search procedure to prevent the generation of certain redundant inferences. The augmentation makes use of lemmas to avoid replicating deduction sequences in solving multiple instances of the same subproblem at distinct places in the search space."
"A new resolution strategy for Horn sets of clauses, each clause of which contains no more-than one positive literal, is presented which requires that in each resolution either one ancestor be a false positive unit or that one ancestor and the resolvent both be false. This strategy emphasizes \"relevant\" positive units while controlling the explosive nonunit resolution. Some properties of interpretations for Horn sets are reviewed and used to significantly reduce the computation and storage required to implement semantic resolution for Horn sets."
"This paper presents a new representation and technique for proving theorems automatically that is both computationally more effective than resolution and permits a clear and concise formal description. A problem in automatic theorem proving can be specified by a set of clauses, containing literals, that represents a set of axioms and the negation of a theorem to be proved. The set of clauses can be replaced by a graph in which the nodes represent literals and the edges link unifiable complements. The nodes are partitioned by clause membership, and the edges are labeled with a most general unifying substitution. Given this representation, theorem proving becomes a graph-searching problem. The search technique presented here, in effect, unrolls the graph into sets of solution trees. The trees grow in a well-defined breadth-first way that defines a measure of proof complexity."
"A new inference rule for resolution based theorem proving, termed qualified hyperresolution, is presented from a practical point of view. The method of qualification is intended to deal with clause sets involving not-everywhere-defined functions. Two examples illustrating the effects of the method are discussed in detail. The potential practical value of the method is indicated by substantial improvements over the performance of ordinary hyperresolution obtained in five test problems."
"This paper focuses on the interface between program verification and mechanical theorem proving. It is often much easier to express what a program does in higher order logic than in first-order logic. However, in general, higher order theorem proving is difficult to mechanize. Hence we have isolated some special classes of higher order formulas and will show how they can be processed efficiently by a computer. Examples are given that illustrate how naturally these formulas arise in program verification."
"In this paper we outline two basic methods for automated theorem proving in nonclassical logics, including modal, many-valued, relevance, and intuitionistic logics. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each method and give several illustrative examples. We outline a procedure for attacking more complex problems using a combination of the two basic methods. Results of experimental applications of the techniques are reported."

"In this paper, binary-vector Boolean algebra, a generalization of ordinary Boolean algebra [6], is introduced. In this algebra, every element is represented by a binary vector and in addition to ordinary AND, OR, and NOT operations, a new operation called the rotation operation which rotates (rightward or leftward) the components of a binary vector is introduced. Moreover, the NOT or COMPLEMENTATION operation is extended to a more general operation called the generalized complement which includes the total complement (ordinary complement), the null complement (no complement), and newly introduced partial complements. Because of this generalization, all axioms and theorems of ordinary Boolean algebra are generalized. In particular, it is shown that DeMorgan's theorem, Shannon's theorem, and the expansion theorem are generalized into more general forms which include their corresponding ordinary version as a special case. It is also shown that any multivalued logic truth table can be represented by a vector Boolean function. Three compact canonical (sum-of-products and product-of-sums) forms of this function are presented."
"An approach to fault-tolerant design is described in which a computing system S and an algorithm A to be executed by S are both defined by graphs whose nodes represent computing facilities. A is executable by S if A is isomorphic to a subgraph of S.A k-fault is the removal of k nodes (facilities) from S.S is a k-fault tolerant (k-FT) realization of A if A can be executed by S with any k-fault present in S. The problem of designing optimal k-FT systems is considered where A is equated to a 0-FT system. Techniques are described for designing optimal k-FT realizations of single-loop systems; these techniques are related to results in Hamiltonian graph theory. The design of optimal k-FT realizations of certain types of tree systems is also examined. The advantages and disadvantages of the graph model are discussed."
"The constraints imposed by various types of irredundancy on the structure of combinational logic networks are investigated. It is shown that the usual notion of irredundancy, here called a-irredundancy, places bounds on the maximum number of inputs to certain types of network structures. A network is called b-redundant if it contains a cascade of single-input gates that can be reduced to either an inverter or a single line. Let Nab(Z) denote all realizations of Z that are both a- and b-irredundant. If N ∈ Nab(Z), then the number of gates in any fan-out-free subnetwork of N is bounded. It is shown that a solution to some important design optimization problems can be found in Nab(Z). It is conjectured that Nāb(Z) is finite and some results supporting this conjecture are presented. For example, it is impossible to construct an arbitrarily long cascade of networks that perform the identity transformation without introducing a- or b-redundancy. A more general type of redundancy, c-redundancy, is defined which includes both a- and b-redundancy as special cases. The class of c-irredundant realizations of Z is finite."
"Based on the intuitive observation that smaller numbers of gates and connections would usually lead to a more compact network on an integrated circuit (IC), a monotonically increasing function of gate count and connection count is concluded to be a reasonable cost function to be minimized in the logical design of a network implemented in IC. Then it is shown that all minimal solutions of such a cost function always can be found among the following: minimal networks with a minimal number of gates as the first objective and a minimal number of connections as the second objective; minimal networks with a minimal number of connections as the first objective and a minimal number of gates as the second objective; and minimal networks which are associated with the above two types of minimal networks. All three of these types of minimal networks of NOR gates, as an example, are calculated by logical design programs based on integer programming, for all functions of 3 or less variables and also some functions of 4 variables which require 5 or less NOR gates. According to the computational results, for the majority of the functions the first type of minimal networks is identical to the second type, and for no function were networks of the third type found to exist."
"The working set paging algorithm is known to be highly efficient, yet has the disadvantage that during changes of locality large numbers of pages are accumulated in memory Unnecessarily. The author proposes a modification of the working set algorithm called the damped working set(DWS)algorithm which resists sudden expansion of working set size and exhibits far greater stability in the number of page frames-allocated to an active process. Program address traces are analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the DWS algorithm."
"A demand prepaging algorithm DPMIN is defined and proved to be an optimal demand prepaging algorithm. However, it cannot be used in practice since it requires that the future refreence string be completely known in advance. Several practical prepaging algorithms are also defined which require only a partial knowledge of the future reference string. Finally, we show that these prepaging algorithms reduce the paging problems of array algorithms operating on large arrays."
"This paper addresses the following question. A computer system is presented with a very long list of ordered items and files a summarized description of the data to facilitate answering queries about the order of the items in the list. What is the minimum storage space required to guarantee that the fraction of incorrect answers remains below a specified level?"
"Much research has recently been done on processor interconnection schemes for parallel computers. These interconnection schemes allow certain permutations to be performed in less than linear time, typically 0(log N), 0(log2N), or 0(√N) for a vector of N elements and N processors. In this paper we show that many permutations can also be performed in less than linear time on a machine with an Illiac IV-type interconnection scheme, that is connections to processors at distances of ± 1 and ±√N. These reselts show that, for irregular permutations, these recently developed interconnection schemes yield a speedup of at most 0(√N) over the Illiac IV-type interconnections. These results are of current interest due to the present Illiac IV programming effort."
"Nonparametric clustering algorithms, including mode-seeking, valley-seeking, and unimodal set algorithms, are capable of identifying generally shaped clusters of points in metric spaces. Most mode and valley-seeking algorithms, however, are iterative and the clusters obtained are dependent on the starting classification and the assumed number of clusters. In this paper, we present a noniterative, graph-theoretic approach to nonparametric cluster analysis. The resulting algorithm is governed by a single-scalar parameter, requires no starting classification, and is capable of determining the number of clusters. The resulting clusters are unimodal sets."
"(2,1) separating systems have earlier been shown to be useful in designing asynchronous sequential circuits [6]. In this paper, techniques to derive (2,1) separating systems from linear error-correcting codes are given. It is shown that the proposed techniques yield better (2,1) separating systems than earlier klown techniques."
"Eklundh's fast matrix transposition algorithm for transposing a 2nX 2nmatrix is extended here to the general case where 2i( j ≥ 1) of its rows will fit into primary storage.

"The emitter function iogic (EFL) structure is a bipolar integratable circuit suitable for large-scale-integration (LSI). The structure is a development of current-mode logic and it permits the LSI realization of complex logic functions with similar silicon area and power dissipation to a single conventional ECL gate. In order to use the structure in logic design, some of its properties are developed and a logic design technique is given with examples."
"This correspondence suggests a new method of perporming binary multiplication using the quarter square technique. As compared to the previous methods [1],[2] the proposed scheme is more general in that it can be readily applied to numbers of any word length. Moreover, it has been shown that for the eight-bit case the present method is faster, more systematic, and economical than the earlier schemes."

"Program families are defined (analogously to hardware families) as sets of programs whose common properties are so extensive that it is advantageous to study the common properties of the programs before analyzing individual members. The assumption that, if one is to develop a set of similar programs over a period of time, one should consider the set as a whole while developing the first three approaches to the development, is discussed. A conventional approach called \"sequential development\" is compared to \"stepwise refinement\" and \"specification of information hiding modules.\" A more detailed comparison of the two methods is then made. By means of several examples it is demonstrated that the two methods are based on the same concepts but bring complementary advantages."
"The key to software reliability is to design, develop, and manage software with a formalized methodology which can be used by computer scientists and applications engineers to describe and communicate interfaces between systems. These interfaces include: software to software; software to other systems; software to management; as well as discipline to discipline within the complete software development process. The formal methodology of Higher Order Software (HOS), specifically aimed toward large-scale multiprogrammed/multiprocessor systems, is dedicated to systems reliability. With six axioms as the basis, a given system and all of its interfaces is defined as if it were one complete and consistent computable system. Some of the derived theorems provide for: reconfiguration of real-time multiprogrammed processes, communication between functions, and prevention of data and timing conflicts."
"The problem of applying formal techniques of program specification and verification to large complex programs is considered. It is argued that a practical solution requires a variety of techniques, including both procedural and nonprocedural specifications, hierarchical program organization, and the use of program transformations. In particular, a case is made for flexible problem-oriented choice of specification techniques and languages. These ideas are expanded by specifying a load-and-go assembler in three parts: a transduction grammar describing the correspondence between concrete and abstract syntax for assembly language programs; a set of transformations of the abstract form; and a nonconstructive axiomatic specification of the result of core assembly and loading of transformed abstract programs."
"While \"Dijkstra flow-chart schemes\" (built out of assignment statement schemes by means of composition, IF—THEN and WHILEDO) are simple and perspicuous, they lack the descriptive power of flow-chart schemes (provided additional \"variables\" are not permitted). On the other hand, the analogous multiexit composition binary alternation-conditional iteration (CACI) schemes introduced below, which are virtually as simple and perspicuous as Dijkstra schemes, describe exactly the same computational processes as flow-chart schemes (without the aid of additional variables)."
"Replacement algorithms for virtual memory systems are typically based on temporal measures of locality, while predictive loading and program restructuring are based on spatial measures of locality. This paper suggests some techniques for dynamically improving the spatial locality of a program via predictive loading and virtual space restructuring, and presents the results of applying these techniques to actual programs. Bounds are derived for the performance of the methods."
"The picture-building system (PBS) deals with the problem of creating and manipulating data structures for applications using computer graphics. PBS has a data definition facility that enables one to specify structures needed for a given application, a manipulation facility for loading and editing the data, and displaying the image stored in the structures. The structures are defined in a relational data base and allow graphical attributes to be specified in the same way as nongraphical attributes. There is a deliberate attempt to separate data from programs which is in accord with other data-base developments. It is also possible to mix text and vector data with raster scan data which we have found to be very useful in some graphical applications. Some examples and a brief description of our color display system will be given."

"Program development often proceeds by transforming simple, clear programs into complex, involuted, but more efficient ones. This paper examines ways this process can be rendered more systematic. We show how analysis of program performance, partial evaluation of functions, and abstraction of recursive function definitions from recurring subgoals can be combined to yield many global transformations in a methodical fashion. Examples are drawn from compiler optimization, list processing, very high-evel languages, and APL execution."
"We distinguish the activity of writing large programs from that of writing small ones. By large programs we mean systems consisting of many small programs (modules), usually written by different people."
"System correctness often presents itself as the problem of showing that two programs, the \"specification\" and the \"implementation,\" are in some sense equivalent. Such a concept of equivalence is supplied by Milner's definition of simulation between programs. This paper presents a problem-reduction approach to proving simulation, and describes an interactive system designed for this purpose."
"A statistical design of an experiment for modeling the performance (access time) of a data base (DB) system in a controlled environment has been outlined. A three-factor pilot experiment with retrieval sequence, logical view (combined with access method), and target segment type as factors was designed and the results analyzed for a specific IMS batch DB. It was found that: 1) the variation of sequences of DB retrieval calls in the application program did not have any signifilcant effect on the access time, whereas the other two factors did have significant effect; 2) the variability in access time is not completely explained by these three factors; and 3) the distribution of the residual error is \"nonnormal,\" with a large positive skew."
"The problem of distributing a data base (with logical associations between segment types) on a computer network such that multiple segment types satisfying a query can be retrieved in paralel from different nodes has been introduced. Properties of such distributions without redundancy and with redundancy have been discussed. Lower bounds on the number of nodes needed for such distributions have been given. Algorithms for constructing such distributions have also been given. Distributions of data bases for queries whose target segments form a combinatorial set have been studied in detail. Closed form expressions for redundancy have been obtained for such query sets."
"The source code for 120 production PL/I programs from several General Motors' commercial computing installations has been collected. The programs have been scanned both manually and automatically. Some data from the scanning process are presented and interpreted."
"A method for quickly producing compilers for high level languages is described. The technique consists of feeding a description of the language to be translated to a general-purpose macro processor. Used in this way, the macro processor functions as a compiler-compiler, providing automatic parsing, lexical scanning, symbol table operations, and handling of syntactic errors. A complete syntactic and semantic description of a WHILE statement (except for Boolean expression processing) is given in only seven lines, as an example. A system programming language implemented by this method is discussed in order to illustrate the main ideas. The compiler produced for this language is compared to other compilers produced by conventional methods."
"It is our habit in writing an English composition that, as we write each word, each phrase, each sentence, and each paragraph, we consciously or unconsciously check the syntax and the semantics of the composition just written. Writing a computer program in a high-level language could be made similar to writing a composition in English. In this case, a highly interactive highlevel language system checks the syntax and the semantics of the highlevel language program as each symbol, each expression, and each statement are being entered at the terminal. When the source program is completely entered, the program could have been debugged and could have run once."
"This correspondence describes an experimental comparison of timing information provided by a large multiprogramming operating system (OS/360 MVT) with timing information derived directly from a high-resolution hardware clock. The hardware clock was found to be a superior source of timing information."

"An autoprogrammer is an interactive computer programming system which automatically constructs computer programs from example computations executed by the user. The example calculations are done in a scratch pad fashion at a computer display using a light pen or other graphic input device, and the system stores a detailed history of all of the steps executed in the process. Then the system automatically synthesizes the shortest possible program which is capable of executing the observed examples. The paper describes the computational environment provided by the system, proves that the program synthesis technique is both \"sound\" and \"complete,\" describes the design of the system, and gives some programs it was used to create."
"Fortran is 21 years old; many would say that it has not reached adulthood but senility. Yet it remains the language of use in the overwhelming majority of scientific applications of computers and no end to this situation is in sight. Moreover, its evolution through the standards process is very slow, too slow to give any hope that Fortran will ever in this way become a language in which structured programs can be easily and effectively written."
"Many languages, including Fortran, and machines such as most minicomputers have little or no built-in character manipulation capability and yet are often required to process character information. This paper discusses the programming of character processing in such integer environments. Character representation, string-to-word coordinate transformation, packing, and unpacking using several arithmetic schemes are discussed with special attention to program portability. Several Fortran subroutines are presented culminating in BYTRAN, a set of portable Fortran subroutines that simulate the string structures and operators of the PL/I language."
"In this paper, we shall introduce a concept widely used by statisticians, the principal component analysis technique. We shall show that this principal component analysis technique can be used to create new keys from a set of old keys. These new keys are very useful in narrowing down the search domain. We shall also show that the projections on the first principal component direction can be viewed as hashing addresses for the best-match searching problem."
 "Errors, inconsistencies, or confusing points are noted in a variety of published algorithms, many of which are being used as examples in formulating or teaching principles of such modern programming methodologies as formal specification, systematic construction, and correctness proving. Common properties of these points of contention are abstracted. These properties are then used to pinpoint possible causes of the errors and to formulate general guidelines which might help to avoid further errors. The common characteristic of mathematical rigor and reasoning in these examples is noted, leading to some discussion about fallibility in mathematics, and its relationship to fallibility in these programming methodologies. The overriding goal is to cast a more realistic perspective on the methodologies, particularly with respect to older methodologies, such as testing, and to provide constructive recommendations for their improvement."
"A set of test data T for a program P is reliable if it reveals that P contains an error whenever P is incorrect. If a set of tests T is reliable and P produces the correct output for each element of T then P is a correct program. Test data generation strategies are procedures for generating sets of test data. A testing strategy is reliable for a program P if it produces a reliable set of test data for P. It is proved that an effective testing strategy which is reliable for all programs cannot be constructed. A description of the path analysis testing strategy is presented. In the path analysis strategy data are generated which cause different paths in a program to be executed. A method for analyzing the reliability of path testing is introduced. The method is used to characterize certain classes of programs and program errors for which the path analysis strategy is reliable. Examples of published incorrect programs are included."
"This paper describes a system that attempts to generate test data for programs written in ANSI Fortran. Given a path, the system symbolically executes the path and creates a set of constraints on the program's input variables. If the set of constraints is linear, linear programming techniques are employed to obtain a solution. A solution to the set of constraints is test data that will drive execution down the given path. If it can be determined that the set of constraints is inconsistent, then the given path is shown to be nonexecutable. To increase the chance of detecting some of the more common programming errors, artificial constraints are temporarily created that simulate error conditions and then an attempt is made to solve each augmented set of constraints. A symbolic representation of the program's output variables in terms of the program's input variables is also created. The symbolic representation is in a human readable form that facilitates error detection as well as being a possible aid in assertion generation and automatic program documentation."
"For numerical programs, or more generally for programs with floating-point data, it may be that large savings of time and storage are made possible by using numerical maximization methods instead of symbolic execution to generate test data. Two examples, a matrix factorization subroutine and a sorting method, illustrate the types of data generation problems that can be successfully treated with such maximization techniques."
"In this paper we analyze the complexity of algorithms for two problems that arise in automatic test path generation for programs: the problem of building a path through a specified set of program statements and the problem of building a path which satisfies impossible-pairs restrictions on statement pairs. These problems are both reduced to graph traversal problems. We give an efficient algorithm for the first, and show that the second is NP-complete."

 "The ideas behind correctness proofs for programs are outlined, and conventional definitions of assignment, etc., are given. The main part of this paper is the idealized development of a nontrivial program in a disciplined fashion. The use of Dijkstra's \"calculus\" for the formal development of programs as a guide to structuring program development is discussed in relation to the example presented."
"We will consider the inductive mechanisms in five techniques for verifying iterative/recursive program structures: inductive assertion, predicate transformers, subgoal induction, computation induction, and structural induction. We will discover that all five techniques can be justified by a single theorem about inductive proof techniques. We will also show that all five techniques face the problem of finding properties that will carry an induction. Such properties are called inductive sets. We will see that the inductive sets of the five techniques are easily related to one another and that a program proof by any of the techniques can be easily converted to a proof by any of the other techniques. Our conclusion is that computer programs simply are inductive definitions of the functions they compute. Induction is the only method by which they can be proved. The problems of induction are therefore unavoidable."
"The programming language Alphard is designed to provide support for both the methodologies of \"well-structured\" programming and the techniques of formal program verification. Language constructs allow a programmer to isolate an abstraction, specifying its behavior publicly while localizing knowledge about its implementation. The verification of such an abstraction consists of showing that its implementation behaves in accordance with its public specifications; the abstraction can then be used with confidence in constructing other programs, and the verification of that use employs only the public specifications."
"Software development has emerged as a critical bottleneck in the human use of automatic data processing. Beginning with ad hoc heuristic methods of design and implementation of software systems, problems of software maintenance and changes have become unexpectedly large. It is contended that improvement is possible only with more rigor in software design and development methodology. Rigorous software design should survive its implementation and be the basis for further evolution. Software development should be done incrementally, in stages with continuous user participation and replanning, and with design-to-cost programming within each stage."
"This paper discusses the requirements of programmers working in varying environments in relation to software engineering, structured programming, and program verification."
"Controlled sharing of information is needed for many applications. Access-control mechanisms exist in operating systems to provide such controlled sharing. However, programming languages currently do not support such a facility. This paper illustrates how an access-control facility could be incorporated in a programming language. The mechanism described is suitable for incorporation in object-oriented languages that permit the definition of abstract data types, and is defmed in a way that enables compile-time checking of access control."
"Backtracking is a well-known technique for solving combinatorial problems. It is of interest to programming methodologists because 1) correctness of backtracking programs may be difficult to ascertain experimentally and 2) efficiency is often of paramount importance. This paper applies a programming methodology, which we call control structure abstraction, to the backtracking technique. The value of control structure abstraction in the context of correctness is that proofs of general properties of a class of programs with similar control structures are separated from proofs of specific properties of individual programs of the class. In the context of efficiency, it provides sufficient conditions for correctness of an initial program which may subsequently be improved for efficiency while preserving correctness."
"Software validation through testing will continue to be a very important tool for ensuring correctness of large scale software systems. Automation of testing tools can greatly enhance their power and reduce testing cost. In this paper, techniques for automated test data generation are discussed. Given a program graph, a set of paths are identified to satisfy some given testing criteria. When a path or a program segment is specified, symbolic execution is used for generating input constraints which define a set of inputs for executing this path or segment. Problems encountered in symbolic execution are discussed. A new approach for resolving array reference ambiguities and a procedure for generating test inputs satisfying input constraints are proposed. References to arrays are recorded in a table. during symbolic execution and ambiguities are resolved when test data are generated to evaluate the subscript expressions. The implementation of a test data generator for Fortran programs incorporating these techniques is also described."
"The authors are engaged in a project to produce a precise description of a design for a family of operating systems. The design decisions ue being expressed by means of formal module specifications. In an attempt to write a concise specification of one of the most critical modules, a \"virtual memory mechanism,\" some previously discussed specification techniques proved to be inadequate. The specification was much too large. Through a series of improvements in both the design and the specification techniques we have achieved a much more compact description. This paper begins with the motivation for the design, explains the problems discovered in earlier approaches, and describes the improvements that were made. Finally, the design and its specification are explained."
"This paper describes a graph-theoretic complexity measure and illustrates how it can be used to manage and control program complexity. The paper first explains how the graph-theory concepts apply and gives an intuitive explanation of the graph concepts in programming terms. The control graphs of several actual Fortran programs are then presented to illustrate the correlation between intuitive complexity and the graph-theoretic complexity. Several properties of the graph-theoretic complexity are then proved which show, for example, that complexity is independent of physical size (adding or subtracting functional statements leaves complexity unchanged) and complexity depends only on the decision structure of a program."
"Rochester's Intelligent Gateway (RIG) system provides convenient access to a wide range of computing facilities. The system includes five large minicomputers in a very fast internal network, disk and tape storage, a printer/plotter and a number of display terminals. These are connected to larger campus machines (IBM 360/65 and DEC KL10) and to the ARPANET. The operating system and other software support for such a system present some interesting design problems. This paper contains a high-level technical discussion of the software designs, many of which will be treated in more detail in subsequent reports."

    "It is an honor and a privilege to present the Chicago Fall Conference award for outstanding contributions in Consumer Electronics. The recipient of the 1975 Consumer Electronics award is a man who has long been directly involved in various Consumer Electronic products. Some of these products include AC-DC, AM-FM home radios, the 45 RPM phonograph, the first mass-produced monochrome television receiver, and the introduction of color television in 1954. He is a senior member of the IEEE and has 36 patents relating to radio and to monochrome and color television. While the number of patents is significant, it is more important to emphasize that a majority of these patents are considered basic in their field."
  "Due to an increasing interest in color display peripherals by the computer industry, a feasibility study of color display monitors began. This study was to sight specification limits imposed by inherent restrictions of several types of color CRTs."
"The greater part of the beam current in current color CRTs is blocked by the aperture masks. Consequently relatively high electron beam currents are required to obtain sufficient brightness, and this usually leads to increased beam spot size on the phosphor screen and to inferior spatial frequency reproduction characteristics. In order to remedy this drawback, the usual practice has been to boost the amplitude of the luminance signal in the high-frequency region. Typical of such methods is the so-called \"aperture-compensation method\"."
"This paper deals with some practical and cost conscious approaches to varactor tuned radio receivers."
"Videotape recorders intended for the consumer market began to appear about 1964. Since then, many new developments have appeared in the recording of the chroma signal, in the increase of recording density, and in the mechanism of recorders. These developments have brought about the introduction of cassettes to house the videotapes. Representative of such a trend is the U-matic videocassette, the superior performance of which has opened up many technical applications. Recently, the U-matic system has begun to be applied to broadcast uses, drawing worldwide attention."
"Air core coils can be made in a flat configuration with thickness of about two diameters of the conducting atrand plus insulation. They can be wound of wire (WPI's: wound planar inductors) or made on printed circuit boards (PPI's: printed planar inductors). The area of these flat coils for a given inductance is equal to the projected area of the comparable helix plus the area of one turn of that helix. Advantages over conventional belical coils include greatly reduced bulk, increased mechanical aid electrical stability because of flat supporting mounting, high coefficients of coupling, the possibility of making them by etched circuit methods. Distributed capacitances are bigher and Q's slightly lower than for comparable helixes."
 "This paper reports on a signal processing system for video disc and home use VTR based on the time-division-multiplex technique. In this system, the chrominance signal is compressed along the time axis and put in the horizontal blanking period. Thus, it is time-division-multiplexed with the luminance signal. The time-compression is achieved by the time conversion operation of specially developed analog memory. This memory transfers majority carriers in bulk silicon and is provided with sufficient frequency range for the time compression and expansion. In order to eliminate the influence of time base error which is generally introduced during recording and playback processes, a burst sinusoidal signal is added in the horizontal synchronizing pulse and a playback time reference is derived from it."
"This paper presents a phase-locked loop tuning scheme for television that uniquely simplifies the phase-locked loop design by manipulation of the dividers to take advantage of the 6 MHz channel spacing. The system also incorporates a unique digital AFT scheme that utilizes the phase-locked-loop components and provides a means for manually offsetting the IF from its precise tuning of 45.75 MHz. The accuracy of tuning (worst case) occurs on channel 83 with an error of less than ±30 kHz, while the AFT has an error of less than ±1.5 kHz independent of channel. The following list summarizes the system capabilities."
"Digital circuit technique has begun to be applied to television receivers recently. Digital channel selection systems using a varactor tuner and remote control switches are two such examples."
"Described below is a system for broadcasting a discrete quadraphonic program over a single FM transmitter. The system is compatible with current monophonic and biphonic (stereophonic) broadcasting and also with current SCA service. The system maintains 15 kHz bandwidth for the audio signals."
"Phase locked loops built around quadrature detector I.C.'s are extremely simple and low in cost. Using one type of I.C. and a suitable voltage controlled oscillator, phase locked loops for AM detectors, CD-4 record decoders, video player detectors and FM broadcast receiver detectors are easily designed and built. The same design equations apply to all types of loops and necessary constants are easily measured or calculated. Performance in all cases exceeds that of conventional detectors or even I.C.'s designed specifically for the purpose."
"The composite NTSC color television signal consists of a luminance signal and a superimposed subcarrier which is modulated, in amplitude and phase, by chrominance information. The amplitude of the subcarrier determines the reproduced color saturation and its phase, relative to the color synchronizing burst, determines the reproduced hue. Variation of subcarrier amplitude as a function of luminance signal level is called differential gain (DG) distortion. The deviation from constant gain usually is assumed to be the same for the luminance signal as for the subcarrier, although this is not always true. Variation of subcarrier phase as a function of luminance signal is called differential phase (DP) distortion."
"A chrominance demodulator integrated circuit,* is described which includes a novel dynamic flesh correction circuit for modulating the reference carrier in the vicinity of flesh colors as a function of the phase information contained in the chrominance signal. The circuit corrects purple and green flesh tones without affecting the primary red, blue, and green colors."

"Discussed are possible options for isolating the SCR deflection system by means of its existing inductive components. More details are given for isolation on the high-voltage transformer. Several solutions are suggested that are different from conventional flyback designs and that provide safe isolation. The triggering of the comutation and trace switches is arranged such that power supply and commutating parts become self-contained mechanically as well as electrically. Measurements of the characteristics of experimental circuits for a 110 °system are added to demonstrate performance capability and efficiency, Table I."
"The television industry is faced with government pressures to reduce the energy consumption of new TV receivers. Since the TV picture tube with its associated neck components represents the largest and most expensive part of a TV set, it is reasonable to examine the role that it plays in determining energy consumption and to see what options are available to reduce picture tube-related energy consumption. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to convey some insights into TV receiver energy consumption from the CRT manufacturer's point of view and to identify areas in which power savings are possible."
 "The functions of peaking, gain control, subcarrier removal and black level clamping which are normally required in consumer color television receivers are typically handled in the low level luminace signal processing system, A novel design is described here which accomplishes these functions in an optimum manner, and which, in addition, features nonlinear picture quality enhancement as well as variable, phase corrected peaking."
  "Simple but sensitive microwave leakage checkers wqhich do not depend on batteries or the utilitv have been developed. A full scale sensitivitv as high as 0.05 mw/cm2 has been accomplished."
"System considerations in synchronous detection of the composite video signal are analyzed. It is shown that the bandwidth of the reference channel influences the quality of the synchronous detection system. The bandwidth that is practical in the reference channel depends upon the type of tuning system employed. A closed loop frequency synthesizer tuning system with quartz crystal stability and accuracy is the best solution. However, it is possible to improve the performance of quasi-synchronous detection with a conventional type of tuning system by reducing staticphase error in the estimated carrier and retaining or re-establishing the integrity of the AM sideband pairs in the reference channel before amplitude limiting."

"The VHF and UHF tuners are separate units, and each is manufactured and tested by itself. In the television instrument they are electrically interconnected and, in effect, comprise a three band, all channel, varactor tuner. In those instruments using the electromechanical channel selection system, the two units are mounted together with brackets and interconnections so as to provide a single V-U unit. In those instruments featuring the digital direct address system, each tuner is mounted on its associated address system module."

With a single crystal as the basic frequency reference, these circuits produce tuning accuracy and long term stability for a large number of frequencies at lower cost than for mechanical or crystal multiplexing methods."
"Vertical interval test signals (VITS) have been used for network transmission testing for about 20 years. What makes the subject of interest at the present time is: the recent adoption of a new series of network transmission test signals; the adoption of the VITS concept by the FCC in connection with the operation of television broadcast stations by remote control, and by the recent development of equipment which provides for the automatic remote monitoring of VITS and of other equipment which will provide for the automatic correction of distortions in the system as indicated by the test signals. The ultimate goal of VITS is higher quality television pictures --a goal which is becoming more and more important in order to fully exploit current technological advances including the trend towards larger picture display devices. This paper will describe the new network transmission test signals, the FCC test signals, how and why they differ, and how the signals are being utilized. The paper will also include a discussion of how the television industry is working together to develop a plan for the efficient use of all of the vertical blanking interval --in order to provide for these test signals as well as for a variety of other types of signals."
"Color television in the United States began to grow rapidly in the early 1960' s. As the transition took place from a primarily monochrome to a primarily color service, it became increasingly evident that the color characteristics observed on home receivers varied substantially from program to program and station to station. At the suggestion of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), a meeting of the Joint Committee for Inter-Society Coordination (JCIC) was called in 1968 to determine the most effective way to deal with the problem."
"Small neck inline beam color picture tubes and self-convergent yokes are rapidly gaining in popularity. The principal incentive for this trend is, of course, the cost savings resulting from self-convergence. Although this combination produces competitive performance in small picture sizes, conventional small neck, bi-potential, inline guns do not produce adequate resolution for large screen sizes. Zenith's new 19V 100°ABLE tube(l) employs a new extended field lens (EFL) gun which overcomes this limitation. This extended field lens utilizes a novel axial potential distribution. Spot size performance for the gun is significantly better than that of contemporary large neck delta gun tubes."

"The Direct Address System employs a unique remote control that features on-screen display of the selected channel number and the time-of-day. In addition the user selects channels by addressing the system with the channel number desired, therefore, eliminating the necessity of having to sequence through a series of undesired channels, as is the case with most channel selection systems."
"An objective was set at the very beginning of this project to develop a shadow mask color picture tube which would be less costly to produce. The tube could have no sacrifice in performance when compared to a present day shadow mask color tube. There were three main avenues pursued to attain this objective. One was to reduce the number of parts to produce the tube. The second was to reduce the cost of those parts, and the third was to reduce the cost of assembling and processing those parts into a finished product. The result was a system which has a totally new glass for the envelope of the tube, and a new shadow mask to integrate with that glass. The funnel, panel, and shadow mask were designed to fit a concept which would make them conducive to high speed and automatic assembly and process."
"More and more information may be demanded by people for better living and business.

 "At first sight optical readout of videosignal stored on a disc seems to be a difficult and critical task due to what is paradoxically one of its most interesting features: no mechanical contact between the readout \"stylus\" and the information carrying surface of the disc. Since the readout \"stylus\" used here is a light beam, it cannot be simply mechanically guided by a groove, the way it is accomplished, for example with conventional audio records."
"This paper presents considerations involved in the choice of a coding system for an optical video disc system. It thereby embraces the recording process, the optical stylus, the associted servo systems, and the disc properties. It is shown that a 30 minute high quality television program with two separate sound channels can be compressed to a 30cm diameter disc format while allowing adequate tolerances for all aspects of the signal processing."
"From the beginning the aim of MCA' s videodisc development was to make a complete system for playing pre-recorded color programs over a home TV. Such a system was developed and was demonstrated publicly in late 1972, when a video player played a replicated disc into several standard TV sets."
"The entertainment function of the Philips and MCA Optical Videodisc System (Fig. 1 has been established by numerous public demonstrations, r2y3l4t and various authors, 6' 7' 8. The freeze frame and random access capabilities of this optical system enables extremely effective storage of special purpose information. Examples of such special purpose applications employing the Philips consumer player include digital Read-Only-Memories, X-Ray and document storage, and a talking encyclopedia."
"TV receiver and transmitter characteristics required for the elimination of visible adjacent channel interference effects are discussed. The interference mechanisms involved are explained. Effects caused by the upper adjacent channel signal are different in nature from those of a lower adjacent channel signal. It can be shown that the suppression of upper channel interference needs little extra effort, if any, in the receiver, but calls for special care in designing the VSB filter response at the transmitter (or headend modulator). To eliminate interference from the lower adjacent channel, however, the receiver selectivity has to meet requirements which are more stringent than those for the upper adjacent channel."
"The design of a wideband feedforward amplifier in the frequency range 40-300 MHz is described. It is shown that the technology is now available to push the output level over 1 volt for a 12 channel NCTA crossmodulation ratio of -60 dB, or over 1/ 2 volt for a 35 channel NCTA crossmodulation ratio of -60 dB. The triple beat and second order distortion are typically -80 dB down. at the output level of 1 volt. This ultralinear feedforward amplifier is thus an immediate substitute for two distribution amplifiers of conventional design."
"Some of the differences between transistor and thyristor deflection circuits are examined, specifically device structure, critical circuit design, regulators, power-line isolation, and power dissipation."

"Two new additions to the turnstile family of antennas are described: 1) a horizontally polarized \"turnstile II\" antenna and 2) a circularly polarized turnstile antenna. These antennas feature a rotating phase feed based on the original RCA Superturnstile design which, because of its simplicity, electrical characteristics, and versatility, is today the most popular TV broadcast antenna."
"Multiple-antenna arrays are discussed with respect to size, performance characteristics, and cost. Parameters are given to facilitate optimizing by the broadcaster of multiple-antenna structure size and performance. Use of circularly polarized antennas on candelabra arrays is also discussed."
"One of the most critical performance characteristics of the TV antenna system is its ability to transmit \"ghost-free\" pictures. It has been shown that the amount of reflection from the antenna can be correlated to picture quality. How the vestigial sideband RF pulse technique, developed by RCA, more closely simulates TV operation than any other method is discussed. The selection of optimal RE pulse-widths to best reflect correlation with picture quality is discussed. Two RP pulsewidths, one of long duration (up to 2,μs) and the other of shorter duration (0.25, μs), are recommended for use in antenna test measurements. The RF pulse testing procedure can also be used for measuring the color performance of antenna systems."

"A new narrow-band TV system called Sampledot, which produces a live picture with motion and sharpness that is a satisfactory replica of conventional TV, is described. Bandwidth compression ratios of 10:1 have been demonstrated with relatively simple electronics. Higher compression ratios are projected using the technique with a dynamic display memory or storage. The system is compatible with NTSC or EIA video cameras and monitors. Sampledot works on the principle of gating the line-scan video signal raster with a pseudorandom (PR) dot-sample matrix. About 3 percent, or less, of the picture is sent every fast scan field instead of the usual 50 percent. At the receiving end, the monitor raster is gated in step with the PR matrix. The natural integration effects of the eye-brain characteristics plus optional display memory, the large redundancy of TV video, and the high degree of correlation between adjacent TV pixels are exploited in the Sampledot technique."
"The combiner to be described is a lumped constants version of a type of combiner which has been realized for a long time in the frequency range in which the distributed constants technique is practicable [1], [2]."
"The advent of domestic satellite systems and technological improvements in both space and ground equipment makes the use of small aperture earth stations economically feasible and attractive for broadcast satellite applications. With increasing use of the orbit spectrum, there is some concern that broadcast satellite systems may not be able to obtain satisfactory allocations of this orbit-spectrum resource because of interference considerations. Specifilcally, interference calculations based on the present envelope of 9 + 20 log (θ/θ0) result in comparatively large orbit spacings for broadcast satellites. Theoretical and experimental investigations of simple sidelobe suppression techniques, plus an analysis of experimental data on small aperture antennas (from data over a range of 40 < D/λX < 100), indicate that much better sidelobe performance can be obtained with a very small cost or performance penalty."
"Countries that are interested in nationwide distribution of educational television and are too limited in size for satellite television can utilize their microwave network and microwave towers to reach the population in remote areas. For accomplishing this task some of the hardware recently developed for space communication can be applied."
"It is observed that so-called \"three-dimensional\" television has to have a display giving intensity on a four-dimensional space, and not on a three-dimensional space, unless chasiges of perspective with vertical motion of the Viewer are to be discarded. Other errors are noted in the cited papers."

"Incidental phase modulation caused by AM-to-PM conversion (carner phase shift) of RF amplifier degrades the detected video signal performance. Its effects are known to be different for different types of demodulators as well as for different signal types to be incidental phase modulated. This paper shows a simple and general analysis for any form of AM-to-PM conversion using derivative form and supposing the video signal to be relatively small. From the analysis, it can be seen how the video-to-video frequency response varies and how much of the lower sideband (LSB), once filtered, will emerge with respect to the amount of AM-to-PM conversion. The general equation to predict the differential phase (DP) and differential gain (DG) degradation caused by AM-to-PM conversion is presented, from which it is shown that there are special AM-to-PM conversion cases that cause no DP and/or DG degradation."
"The task of ensuring acceptable detected transient response in consumer television receivers is complicated by the large variety of different transmitter vestigial sideband and receiver IF filter characteristics in use. In this paper, the effects of different typical transmitter and receiver passband characteristics in the vestigial sideband region upon detected transient response are analytically examined. Both envelope and synchronous demodulation systems are investigated, and various levels of carrier modulation are assumed. In addition, the effects on transient response of alternate methods for transmitter vestigial sideband filter (VSBF) phase correction are described. In general, it is found that even with the substantial response of many receiver IF filters in the 1-MHz region of the vestigial sideband, acceptable transient response can be obtained provided that appropriate phase correction of the transmitter VSBF is used. Experimental verification of the analytical results is also presented."
 "IN RECENT YEARS several single-tube color TV camera systems have been proposed. Some of them are already on the market. However, there are some defects with these systems which restrict their application field. All these systems use stripe filters, the width and the number of the stripes determining the resolution of the tube."
"This paper will discuss the development of a new radio program automation system by Harris Corporation, Broadcast Products Division. System-90 is a departure for previous automation systems from several standpoints: first, it was approached as a totally integrated system; second, extreme attention was placed on the operators interface with the system; and third, the choice of a microprocessor as the control element."
"Current interest in circular polarization for TV broadcasting has increased to such proportions that many broadcasters are planning new facilities, anticipating its adoption. The VHF high-band and low-band cavity-backed radiator antenna described in this paper is part of a development program aimed at meeting those requirements."
"Television transmission to small inexpensive earth stations is now being explored using conventional domestic satellites. A number of alternatives exist for the technical formatting of the television signal. Some of the tradeoffs in video deviation, bandwidth, and location of the television sound for frequency modulated television are discussed in this paper. The paper is concluded with an example of a system design for the Alaskan Bush communities."
"Realizing the reserve, gain system headroom, and transient demands of many of today's complex synthesized and traditional program materials and the far more stringent system performance specifications required when using multi-track recording methods, the need is felt throughout the broadcast and recording industries for a more sophisticated device for more accurate measurement and control of program levels. The waveforms and asymmetries. present in most voice signals and the transient demands imposed upon any system by the newer synthesized sounds render the standard VU meter somewhat less than. adequate for many of today's needs. The continuing quest for the best sound reproduction bespeaks a need for a level measuring instrument of greater precision which may be used by any operator with a minimum of difficulty. This paper describes such a unit and reports on its use in representative systems using all types of program material. Results indicate a favorable response to the new instrument from many experienced operators."

A video processing unit for reproducion of monochrome images is described. The experimental printing in gravure print is shown and the results are discussed."
"This paper describes the improvement of image quality effected in a reproduction television system by reducing the visibility of the line raster. The methods of reducing the visibility of the line raster are discussed and the organization of the designed line-raster processing unit is shown. Also an image processed by the line-raster processing unit and a reference image are shown."
"The bandwidth of a signal may be analyzed in terms of what is defined as an observable, or detectable, signal level, the frequency range over which this detectable signal occurs, and the percentage of time that the sigal exceeds defined limits. This paper presents a technique for observing and quantitating in real time the frequency excursion of radio signals in the time domain. A scanning spectrum analyzer interfaced to a minicomputer data-acquisition system is used to collect spectral bandwidth data. The concept of percentage band-width occupancy is presented for evaluating the broadcast-signal modulation character and representative data are given for signals in the FM broadcast band."

"This paper briefly describes the NASA F-8 Digital Fly-By-Wire (DFBW) program and Langley Research Center's role in investigating and promoting advanced control laws for possible flight experimentation. The primary purpose of the paper is to provide background material for papers describing some of the F-8 DFBW adaptive control law studies. The paper provides a brief description of the Phase II DFBW F-8 aircraft and its control system, discusses some of the advanced control law study objectives and guidelines, and provides some mathematical models which are useful in the control analysis problem."
"This paper presents design refinement for the baseline F-8C adaptive flight test control laws described in Reference [1]. The baseline laws consist of simplified quadratic-optimal model-following control structures in the pitch and lateral-directional axes. Both axes have variable gains which are adjusted adaptively by an explicit on-line maximum likelihood parameter identifier. The identifier operates in pitch only, using pitch rate, normal acceleration, and elevator position measurements. It consists of five parallel computing channels which evaluate the likelihood function at discrete points in parameter space. The best of these points (the \"min-L\" channel) is selected and a single (modified) Newton-Raphson step is taken from there to estimate the aircraft's surface effectiveness ( Mδ ), pitching moment due to angle-of-attack ( Mα), and air speed (V). Control gains are then adjusted as a function of Mδ. A simplified diagram of this identifier is shown in Figure 1, where the baseline design includes all elements above the dotted line."
"In view of the computational restrictions imposed upon any implementable flight control algorithm, a linear model reference adaptive controller which does not require the explicit online identification of aircraft parameters has been developed. Related analysis shows this algorithm to be at least stable in the sense of bounded plant-model errors provided that certain constraints can be satisfied. If in addition the open loop system satisfies the conditions of perfect model following the closed loop system will be asymptotically stable. Procedures were developed for satisfying the constraints and for adjusting the transient and steady state behavior. Results using the linearized lateral F-8 equations show the algorithm to be capable of adjusting to sudden flight condition changes within 1-2 seconds."
"This paper describes the moving-window parameter adaptive control system developed for the NASA F8-DFBW aircraft. The control system employs a parameter identification process that, iteratively, adjusts parameters of a model of the aircraft motions in a batch processing manner so that responses generated from the model fit the outputs of sensors stored in a finite record referred to as the moving window. Tests are made on the validity of the parameter estimates before using the parameters in an on-line design process. The on-line design process is an algebraic mapping of the parameters of the model into primary control system feedback and feedforward gains. The mapping was selected to satisfy specific flying quality characteristics over the range of parameter variations expected. Results are presented from simulatlon studies on the identification algorithm, tests for parameter validity, and the on-line design process."
"The purpose of the presentation is to discuss the results obtained in the design of a command augmentation system (CAS) for the NASA F-8C Digital-Fly-By-Wire Aircraft using the Multiple Model Adaptive Control (MMAC) method. The design of the adaptive stochastic regulator was discussed previously in references [1] and [2]; in the stochastic regulator design it is assumed that the purpose of the control system is to return the aircraft to equilibrium flight following any initial disturbance. However, the regulator design is not suitable for incorporating pilot command inputs for longitudinal and lateral maneuvers. Thus it has to be modified. Two diffierent approches were used to design the longitudinal and lateral command augmentation systems (CAS)."
"This paper presents an adaptive learning control system for the F-8 DFBW aircraft. The purpose of the control system is to learn plant parameter curves that affect the flight of the aircraft. These parameter curves are used to adjust the gain schedule of the aircraft in a prescribed manner to account for changing aircraft characteristics. The learning control system is an adjustable blend of a gain scheduling system and an adaptive control system in the sense that it takes the best of these two systems and eliminates the undesirable features of each."
"Analytical redundancy is applied to the pitch axis of an aircraft to enhance sensor fault detection. Three different designs based on monitoring Kalman filter residuals or likelihood functions were developed. Sensor failures were simulated to evaluate the performance of the algorithms on a non-linear simulation of an F-8C aircraft. Based on requirements for sensor fault detection and preliminary simulator performance it is concluded that these algorithms have the potential for reducing the level of sensor redundancy in a digital flight control system without compromising performance."
"In this paper we outline the structure of a sensor failure detection and identification (FDI) system designed for the NASA F8C DFBW aircraft. The system is for use in a dualredundant environment, and it takes maximal advantage of all functional and kinematic relationships among the sensed variables. The technique is reliable in that we have designed the system to account for a variety of unmodeled effects and have introduced a new concept - the quality sequential probability ratio (QSPR) - that provides a useful measure of our confidence in each test. The methodology used for determining detector parameters and the \"outer loop logic\" for combining the various sources of information are described."
 "A problem in fire control systems is the estimation of the relative alignment between remotely located target sensor and weapon coordinate frames. This paper describes and analyzes a shipboard system concept for estimating initial misalignments and compensating ships dynamic bending and flexure. The concept uses miniature strapdown inertial sensor assemblies at remote sensor/weapon stations to monitor instantaneous differences in rotational and translational motions. Equations are developed for Kalman filter estimation of alignment and flexure errors using incremental angular displacement and incremental velocity matching measurements. Optimal filter performance predictions are shown graphically for calm and rough sea conditions for both conventional and ring laser gyro inertial sensor assemblies."
 "The design of a multivariable control system is treated. Observer theory is utilized in the design and disturbance inputs are accounted for. The observer is only required to reconstruct the states of the plant associated with the \"slow\" modes of the system. The parameter insensitivity (gain margin) needed is obtained in this way. The observer parameters are selected so as to maximize gain margin and to minimize disturbance transmittances. The errors introduced in neglecting the \"fast\" modes are also taken into account."
"This paper discuses the application of a generalized leaset-squares method for post-flighttest analysis of small submerged craft. Specifically, the purpose is to identify the transfer functions characterizing the longitudinal and lateral dynamics from exprimental data pertaining to appropriate maneuvers. The method utilizes a set of signals, called measurement signals, generated by processing the input-output variables by a cascade of know digital filters. An enginvector of the Gram matrix of the measurement signales yields, after a linear transformation, the estimated coefficients of the desired transfer function. The method offers the advantages of global minima and robustness of estimates relative to data noise."
"An overview of Honeywell's Power Tower concept for conversion of solar generated heat to electricity is presented. The Solar Collector Subsystem control problem is defined. Operating modes including normal tracking, offset pointing, periodic calibration, stowage, and initialization are explained. Mathematics of sun vector computation and atmospheric refraction compensation are discussed. The process of attitude command generation and communication to the individual heliostats is outlined. Features of the control concept which contribute to cost effectiveness are highlighted throughout."
"A field-type sufficiency theorem is proved for two-person zero-sum differential games. It is applicable to such games having discontinuities in the saddle-point function."
"We consider a class of dynamical systems subject to parameter and input uncertainty whose values range in a given compact set. Utilizing the philosophy of \"worst case\" design, we deduce a feedback control that assures uniform asymptotic (Lyapunov) stability of the origin under all admissible uncertainties."
"In this paper, optimal control problems Where there is uncertainty in the initial state measurement or where there are uncertain parameters in the state equations are investigated. It is assumed that nature will choose the uncertainty to maximize the cost which the controller is attempting to minimize. Thus a minmax control is sought. Sufficient conditions for a control to be a minmax control are presented. These conditions suggest methods for finding the minmax control and such techniques are described. The application of these methods is illustrated by example problems."
"The purpose of this paper is to discuss some techniques which can be used for the computation of the characteristic function of an m-player game without side payments."
"Based on a set of necessary conditions for Pareto optimality in multicriteria optimization problems derived by Leitmann and Schmitendorf, systems governed by partial differential equations are investigated."
"In this paper an application of differential game theory in the area of microeconomics is presented. The problem considered is that of dynamic duopoly where two firms each limited by a maximum capacity of production, share the same market, and try simultaneously but independently to maximize their profits over a certain planning horizon. Necessary conditions for the Cournot Solution in the general case are discussed and more specific results for the special case of linear demand and quadratic cost functions are developed."
 "From the external descriptions algorithms are obtained for the construction of discrete-time, internally bilinear state-space models with unknown initial states. Both the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous bilinear systems are treated. In both cases explicit existence criteria for minimal realization as well as the state space isomorphism theorems are given. One unusual result is that for a given input/output map there exist minimal realizations which are not equivalent under basis transformations. In the special case of zero initial state the algorithm can be reduced to the one previously obtained by Isidori, and if the input-output map is linear, the algorithm reduces to that given by Ho and Kalman for linear systems. Finally, the abstract realization theory is given. We use the affine tensor product as a basic tool to describe both homogeneous and inhomogeneous bilinear systems. The state space is constructed via Nerode equivalence. This forms a theoretical basis for the realization algorithms obtained in this paper."
"In this paper, we will present a new representation of a probability density function on the three dimensional rotation group, SO(3), which generalizes the exponential Fourier densities on the circle. As in the circle case, this class of densities on SO(3) is also closed under the operation of taking conditional distributions. Several simple multistage estimation and detection models will be considered in this paper. The closure property enables us to determine the sequential conditional densities by recursively updating a finite and fixed number of coefficients. It also enables us to express the likelihood ratio for signal detection explicitly in terms of the conditional densities."
"A realization theory is developed for bounded polynomial input/output maps, a class which includes linear, multilinear, and internally-bilinear input/output maps."
"An overview is given of BLS (bilinear system) identification and a method which uses Walsh functions is introduced. Walsh functions, their group properties with respect to binary algebra and their integral approximation in terms of Walsh functions, are used conveniently to identify BLS parameters for a simplified model of the immune system's generation of antibodies in disease control. The technique is effective for time-variant bilinear systems and quadratic systems as well."
"We analyze here state space models for bilinear hereditary differential systems of various levels of complexity. It is shown that for many reasons it is more convenient to develop state space models in Hilbert spaces, following the method of Delfour and Mitter. In certain cases explicit bilinear operational differential equations are obtained that illustrate the way the controls influence the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the system. Certain connections with the theory of Lie semigroups are also discussed."
 "A new application of Bayesian technique to classify the recovery trajectories of patients after Aortic-coronary (AC) bypass surgery is presented. Patients are classified into three types by the physicians: rapid recovery, satisfactory recovery and marginal recovery. The objective of this study was to develop an analytical classification method which is more repeatable than the clinical classification and which can be used to predict a patient's recovery type. Eleven selected clinical measurements were observed before, immediately after, one and two days after surgery. The feature vector used for the trajectory classification is based on the normalized distances to five shock states defined in terms of these clinical measurements, at each epoch. The existing data base of 55 patients is divided into two groups: 32 for analysis and the remaining 23 for test. For analysis, the time dependent and multi-dimensional characterizing parameters such as the mean and covariance matrics for these three types of patients were estimated from the history of the 32 AC bypass patients. A two level non-linear recognition algorithm, using Chow's dependence tree and other procedures, was developed for this study. Very good agreement was found between the physician's and the computer classifications: 100% on analysis data and 95% on the test data. The results also indicate that earlier prediction is feasible, 89% agreement has been found between the predicted computer classification for the 23 test patients immediately after surgery and the physicians' judgement based on the clinical data up to two days after surgery."
"Two pattern recognition techniques capable of handling unordered discrete data are applied to the analysis and classification of clinical data. The first technique uses a dependence-tree approach for classifying and datecting patterns from the discrete data. The second technique is based on modulo-2 linear transformation and approximation of probability distributions. Both techniques are applied to clinical data of two categories of liver diseases: acute viral hepatitis and chronical active hepatitis. The data selected by a physician for identifying and discriminating these two liver diseases consists of 12 features, each feature having a range of two or three discrete values. Experimental results using the two techniques are presented."
"A significant amount of the diagnostic information contained in radiographic images is of a textural nature. This is indicated by the presence of the adjectives \"fluffy, honeycombed, spotted, etc.\" in the radiologist descriptive vocabulary. Unfortunately, the textural patterns representing disease entities On radiographs are fairly complex. If one couples this fact with the obvious need for correct classification of disease entities, then the problem of choosing the \"best\" texture algorithm becomes one of concern. The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical comparison of the \"innate\" abilities of four texture analysis algorithms to do automated texture discrimination. The algorithms to be examined are the Spatial Gray Level Dependence Method, the Gray Level Run Length Method, the Power Spectral Method, and the Gray Level Difference Method."
 "Many biomedical images share the property that their objects and object properties are highly predictable. This makes model-matching techniques attractive for recognition of those objects. Here we examine some ways for generating and testing correspondences between \"observed\" entities and objects of the model that may be useful for diagnosis. In particular, a method is given to efficiently generate a sequence of maximal matchings, and an initial experiment applying a matching technique to chest x-ray data is described."
"A technique is developed whereby one can synthesize a causal, linear time-Invariant estimator that is optimal for restricted types of nonstationary processes. The technique is applicable to linear, time-invariant systems (driven by nonstationary state noise) for which scalar observations are made in the presence of additive nonstationary noise. Two-dimensional Fourier transforms are used to obtain an expression for the estimator's mean square error. It is assumed that it is desirable to minimize the time integral of this expression. The calculation of this integral results in an expression which can be minimized by selecting an estimator depending in a prescribed way on the two-dimensional Fourier transforms of the state and observation noise. The resulting estimator is causal, linear, and time invariant. It is similar in some respects to the Wiener filter that can be derived under the assumptions of stationary state and observation noise processes. The estimator's usefulness is limited by the requirement that the observations be scalar, and the nonstationary processes have Fourier transformable autocorrelation functions."
  "The relations Characterizing the optimal minimal-order observer-based compensators for a linear time-invariant multivariable system in a certain canonical form, with a random initial state (or equivalently, known initial state with white driving noise) have been reported by Miller [1] and independently by others [2], [3]. In this note, we establish in general that the plant transfer function uniquely determines the optimal compensator transfer function, and that this characterizes precisely the degrees of freedom in the compensator design. Any two realizations of the optimal compensator dynamics yield the same performance."
"Optimal filtering equations are obtained for very general linear stochastic delay systems. Asymptotic stability of the optimal filter is proved for the case where there are no delays in the observations. Finally the cascade of the optimal filter and the deterministic optimal quadratic control system is shown to be asymptotically stable as well."
"The state estimation problem for bilinear stochastic systems evolving on spheres is considered. The problem is motivated by some applidimensions. Then the theory of harmonic analysis on spheres is used to define assumed density approximations which result in implementable suboptimal estimators for the state of the bilinear system."
"Stability conditions are developed, for a general class of nonanticipative two-dimensional digital filters which includes but is not limited to spatially causal filters. The conditions relate stability of filters with rational transfer functions to the behavior of their impulse response and lead to novel stability criteria applicable in the minimum mean-square design of two-dimensional filtering operations."
"The optimal control of the autonomous linear process X = Ax + Bu with quadratic cost functional is studied. Initial and terminal times and positions are fixed. An assumption, weaker than invertibility, is placed on the matrices involved. A closed form for the optimal control is given. The extension of the method to other problems is discussed, including infinite systems and discrete problems."
"An algorithm is given-for computing a feedback matrix which assigns closed loop eigenvalues and gives relatively low closed loop eigenvalue sensitivity and/or relative low average cost ∞0∫ x'Qx + u'Ru. The algorithm, based on a recent characterization of all possible sets of closed loop eigenvectors corresponding to the set of closed loop eigenvalues, is considerably more efficient than those which use a direct search on the elements of the feedback matrix."
"This paper develops a hierarchically-structured, suboptimal controller for a linear stochastic system composed of fast and slow subsystems. It is proved that the controller is optimal in the limit as the separation of time scales of the subsystems becomes infinite."
"For systems with slow and fast subsystems a near-optimum state regulator is composed of two subsystem regulators. Conditions for complete separation of slow and fast regulator designs are formulated. A second order approximation of the optimal performance is achieved without the Knowledge of the small singular perturbation parameter."
"The problem of the invariance of the input-output behavior of time-invariant linear systems under perturbations in the system matrices and initial conditions is examined. Previous results are unified and expanded upon, and new results for invariance in the presence of perturbations in the output matrix are given. Conditions for input-output invariance are related to the subspace of reachable states and its orthogonal complement, and to the subspace of unobservable states."
"An extended formulation of the optimal control problem is proposed that assesses system performance using a performance index that measures both control performance and the costs for implementing the control law. This extended problem formulation is illustrated by the control and sampling problem, where the sampling times at which measurements are taken and control commands dispatched are control variables. The control law is thus determined by selecting the number of sampling times, the length of sampling intervals, and the levels of each control element during each sampling interval. The optimal control system design is proved to approach the optimal continuous-time control for the special case where the cost of implementation is negligible and the number of sampling times can be arbitrarily large. The optimal control system design is shown to approach the optimal periodic sampled-data control when the costs of implementation are very large and have a particular form."
"Does time-dependent periodic control yield better process performance than optimal steady, state control? This paper examines exhaustively the role of first order necessary conditions in answering this question. For processes described by autonomous, ordinary differential equations, a very general optimal periodic control problem is formulated. Necessary-conditions are derived for solutions of this problem, steady-state solutions of this problem, and solutions of a related steady-state problem. The relationships between the three sets of necessary conditions and the three sets of solutions is explored extensively. The results integrate and amplify results which have appeared in the literature."
"The optimal power flow problem with tieline security constraints is formulated as a two-level optimization scheme for interconnected power systems. In contrast with other approximate methods, the exact overall power system equations are decomposed into first-level subsystems which correspond to individual company networks. The particular decomposition developed in this paper readily lends itself to the imposition of tieline security constraints by the second-level coordinator. Conditions for the optimal coordination of subsystems are formulated to require a minimal amount of data interchange. An efficient second-level coordination algorithm is developed to achieve the exact overall optimal power flow solution in a few iterations. This is illustrated by a few sample problems for a fully interconnected three subsystem network."
"The dynamic analysis of a balanced three-phase electrical power system comprised of a finite set of: (1) synchronous generators, (2) induction and/or synchronous devices, (3) transmission line networks, (4) RL (or RLC)-loads, and (5) mechanical loads is analyzed by use of the state variable approach. Each component of the electric power system is described by its own state model. These constituent component state models are then interconnected as dictated by the topology of the power system at hand, and the state model for the total system is derived. The resultant state model can then be solved on a digital computer. The state models of the energy converters, the RL-load, and the mechanical load are borrowed from [6, 7 and 8], and the state model of the transmission line is borrowed from [1]. Finally, the algorithm GEBVEM, developed in [1] is used to formulate the state model of the power system at hand and to provide solutions for the desired state variables."
"This paper presents a solution method to the problem of long range optimal expansion planning of an electric power transmission network. The problem is formulated as a discrete-time deterministic optimal control problem. A non linear branch and bound solution method is developed. For a finite planning period, upper and lower bounds of the objective function are computed. Enumeration of the discrete controls is then bounded. The method proceeds by consistently narrowing the bounds until the optimal trajectory is isolated. The method provides a computationally efficient tool for determining an optimal expansion plan. The impact of the economy of scale and cost escalation is readily assessed."
"An on-line optimal environmental/economic dispatch methodology for electric power generation is developed in this paper. Aside from the conventional economic dispatch, constraints on air quality are added to the minimum fuel cost problem. Using the integrated, Gaussian puff model based on the statistical turbulent theory, rapid dynamic features of pollutant dispersion and its forecast surrounding the plants are emphasized. By applying a convex programming algorithm repeatedly, a set of marginal environmental imposts for the power plants at different times are obtained. Such imposts are incorporated with the fuel cost in the ordinary short-term economic dispatching program to indirectly account for the environmental impact of power generation on the ambient air quality."
"This paper demonstrates an approach to treat partial dynamic uncertainties for purposes of electric power system monitoring and control. Stochastic modeling from real time measurements, and system parameter estimation techniques are used to identify the unknown dynamics. Cases of dynamic uncertainties, often encountered in electric power system studies, and discussed in this paper involve: [i] Electric load demand forecast, and/or system frequency prediction for purposes of system planning and automatic generation control. [ii] Dynamic characterization of electric loads or generators for different stability studies. [iii] Equivalencing of unknown parts of partially specified networks for handling large scale system complexities, computational cost and storage limitations. For a given sequence of load demands, Case (i), or frequency, a stochastic one-step-ahead predictive model is postulated and a set of undetermined parameters is estimated. In Case (ii), dynamical model for transients as seen at a particular load bus is formulated from current and voltage data gathered. Two separate feed-forward and feedback-loops generating current and voltage processes are then identified, conveying the interdependence of the two processes and orthogonality of disturbances. In Case (iii), dynamic equivalencing of totally or partially unknown parts of a large power system is considered. The static performance of the unspecified part is represented through generalised Thevenin's theory, or computed from tie line measurements. The dynamic impact of the unknown areas on the parts of concern is analyzed as a stochastic stationary process excited by unknown disturbances and observable inputs. Some case studies are referred to."
"This paper describes the results of a study aimed at investigating the problem of optimal growth as an optimal control problem involving the maximization of welfare subject to the constraints embodied in a long-term macroeconomic energy model. For the policy optimization experiments, we as- -sumed that the set of policy instruments included the rate of taxes on capital income and Capital property, investment tax credits, sales taxes on consumption and investment goods and other tax rates. The performance index for the optimal control problem, is defined as the present value of a discounted stream of utilities accruing to households from the consumption of energy goods, nonenergy goods, capital services and leisure. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the optimization experiments from the standpoint of long-term energy policy planning."
 "The Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition Algorithm (DWDA) is viewed as a resource allocation procedure for a multidivisional firm. An evaluation procedure is proposed that provides incentives in equilibrium for the divisional managers to follow the rules of the DWDA even though they are able to \"cheat\" in a manner that could not be detected. The evaluation procedure is based on a measure that is not simply an index of the division's \"profit\" contribution, but one incorporating the division's true opportunity cost to the firm. The evaluation procedure for the DWDA is a specific example of a general procedure for the incentive compatible control of large divisionalized organizations using iterative decomposition algorithms."
 "The problem of access control to a packet switched multi-access satellite broadcast channel is considered in the framework of non-classical control theory. This viewpoint, with the simple model presented, gives us some interesting results. It is shown under certain assumptions, that because of the inherent delay in information the optimal control law will be within the class of open loop control laws. By a result in Bayesian decision theory it is shown that randomized decisions will not be necessary. Given an additional minor restriction we find that for 'new' packets only two modes of operation of the channel could be optimal, namely: 'All Together' (every station sends whenever it has a packet) or 'Round Robin' (every station sends whenever it is its turn and it has a packet), and an equation for the crossover arrival probability Po at which the channel would switch from All Together (P<Po) to Round Robin (P¿Po) is given. For collided packets we find that it is optimal to have predetermined assignments of groups of stations to time slots for retransmissions, and a dynamic programming algorithm for determining the optimal grouping is given."
"This paper considers the design and evaluation of large-scale state estimation algorithms which utilize information exchange over noisy communication channels. The role of the surely locally unbiased filter in evaluating the trade-offs between the cost of information transfer and filter performance is examined and an algorithm for the design of optimal information exchange is presented. The theoretical results are illustrated via an application to a power system model."
 "This study examines the relationship between the use of monetary aggregates as intermediate targets in stabilization policy and the appropriate monetary policy response to past deviations in the aggregates from their target levels. As a first step, the optimal money stock is related to ultimate targets-such as full employment and price stability-in the context of a stabbilization policy derived as the solution to the Linearquadrati-Gaussian optimal control problem. Then the economy is perturbed by shocks to both the real and financial sectors, leading to deviations in the money stock from its tsrget values. The optimal responses to these shocks and the resulting money stock deviations are examined and compared to responses based on two alternative monetary policy mechanisms: a monetarist type and a stylized version of the procedure adopted by the monetary authority pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution 133."
"One of the most pervasive forms of the unobservable variable problem in econometrics is the appearance of expectational variables in any carefully motivated theory of economic behavior. Some theory of expectation formation must lie at the base of all but the most tautological theories of individual decision making. This fact has long been recognized by economists and the common approach to dealing with it has been to model expectations as a deterministic function of the past values of the variable being considered. This paper suggests a procedure for estimating expectations as the unobservable states of a dynamic system. The approach used combines output correlation methods with the Kalman filter to obtain estimates of the price expectations. These techniques have been widely used in the control theory literature to address unobservable problems in engineering applications although certain modifications are necessary to make them fully applicable in an econometric environment."
"A structure of uncertainty which is consistent with \"Keynesian\" or \"monetarist\" theories is modeled. In a single equation model it is shown how the optimal policy depends on the structure of uncertainty. Optimal policies for a small estimated macroeconomic model based on a similar structure of uncertainty are derived empirically and compared with the single equation results."
"In this paper, an optimal control approach to a problem in national settlement system planning is presented. The problem description is the same as considered by MacKinnon [6] and by Evtushenko and Mackinnon [4]. It is shown how the special structure of the model and the singular nature of the control can be used to reduce the solution of a nonlinear programming problem to the solution of sets of linear equations. A branch and bound integer programming algorithm is used to handle inequality constraints on the control variables. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section I considers problem formulation and an optimal control solution is discussed in Section II. A branch and bound technique for determining active constraints is presented in Section III. A more general problem is considered in Section IV and conclusions are stated in Section V."
 "The theory of algebraic functions is used to extend to multivariable systems the basic techniques used in classical single-loop feedback theory for studying gain as a function of frequency and closed-loop frequency as a function of gain. This enables the basic building blocks of the classical frequency-response approach : poles, zeros, Nyquist diagrams, and root-locus-diagrams, to be used for multivariable feedback systems."
"Rosenbrock's inverse Nyquist array design method is reviewed-briefly and its application to the design of multivariable controllers for an automotive gas turbine, a chemical reactor, and a multistream heater is presented. In each case, the resulting control scheme is simple, and the design method provides useful insight into the control problems."
"A general transfer function approach to the solution of the continuous stationary Kalman-Bucy filter and the time invariant linear deterministic and stochastic optimal control problems is presented. A generalised spectral factor is defined by which the equivalence between the time domain and the frequency domain approaches to these problems is established. An explicit expression for this generalised spectral factor is given. In the case where the number of system inputs and outputs is much smaller than the order of the system, the computation involved is much faster and requires less storage than is required to solve the Riccati equation of the time domain approach. The theory is also extended to the case of coloured signals and linear dynamical operators in the performance index and a simple solution to the singular optimal control problem is derived."
"Multi-loop linear-quadratic state-feedback (LQSF) regulators are shown to be robust against a variety of large dynamical, time-varying, and non-linear variations in open-loop dynamics. The results are interpreted in terms of the classical concepts of gain and phase margin, thus strengthening the link between classical and modern feed-back theory."
"A characterization of multivariable system zeroes as the common eigenvalues of certain matrices is obtained. Major differences are noted between this and other approaches, including implementation and interpretation of results. In addition, a useful determinantal identity is proven."
"A new approach to the use of Sensors in manipulator or robot control is discussed. The concept addresses the problem of contact or near-contact type of recognition of three-dimensional forms of objects by proprioceptive and/or exteroceptive sensors integrated with the terminal device. This recognition of object shapes both enhances and simplifies the automation of object handling. Several examples have been worked out for the \"Belgrade hand\" and for a parallel jaw terminal device, both equipped with proprioceptive (position) and exteroceptive (proximity) sensors. The control applications are discussed in the framwork of a multilevel man-machine system control. The control applications create Interesting new issues which, in turn, invite novel theoretical considerations. An important issue is the problem of stability in control when the control is referenced to patterns."
"A six-legged robot vehicle with eighteen independently powered joints has been constructed at Ohio State University. This paper describes design trade-offs and computer-control concepts as they relate to this machine. the structure of the computer software used for interactive real-time vehicle control is described in some detail. This software is organized so as to permit sequential on-line optimization of stability, tertain adaptability, and energy in the motion of the vehicle over unenev terrain."
"The paper describes a feasibility study of a system to classify visible defects in flat rolled steel on-line, as the steel emerges from the rolling mill. A visual signal is developed by a television camera, and this signal is processed by a hardware system which stores information from the scans and alerts a small computer when a possible flaw has been detected. Executing a pattern recognition algorithm, the computer makes the final detection and classification decision before the next coil is rolled."
"A two-dimensional statistical model is proposed for the characterization of textural pattern, and a technique is introduced for textural pattern recognition by computer. The model building involves two major steps. The first step is the determination of a preliminary model from textural data. In the second step, the model is refined via parameter optimization. The refined model is used to characterize a pattern class. The measured data from an unclassified textural pattern and the estimated data from the models are used to determine similarity measures and variances which provide the key to textural pattern recognition by computer."
"The efficient use of tree representations in pattern recognition requires the construction of deterministic tree automata with a minimum number of states. The conditions for minimization of tree automata are extended and algorithms for the elimination of useless symbols are presented."
"Unsupervised Bayes sequential learning procedures for classification and estimation are often useless in practice because of computational constraints. In this paper, a quasi-Bayes approach is motivated, and discussed in detail for some versions of a two-class decision problem. The proposed procedure mimics closely the formal Bayes solution, whilst involving only a minimal amount of computation. Some numerical illustrations are provided, and the approach is compared with a number of other proposed learning procedures."
"An error-correcting syntax analyzer for tree languages with substitution errors, called structure-preserved error-correcting tree automaton (ECTA), is studied. Substitution errors are defined in terms of transformations which can easily be accommodated to linguistic notion. Let L be a tree language, for a tree ß not in L, the essence of ECTA is to search for a tree α in L such that the cost sequence of error transformations needed to transform α to ß is the minimum among all the sentences in L. A LANDSAT data interpretation problem is used as an example to illustrate the operation of ECTA."
"It is well known that the extended Kalman filtering methodology works well in situations characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio, good observability and a valid state trajectory for linearization. This paper considers a problem not characterized by these favorable conditions. A large number of ad hoc modifications are required to prevent divergence, resulting in a rather complex filter. However, performance is quite good as judged by comparison of Monte-Carlo simulations with the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and by the filter's ability to track maneuvering targets."
"An integrated, dynamic estimation scheme is applied to the problem of synchronizing precision cesium clocks used to control OMEGA signal transmissions from geographically-remote transmitter stations. A discrete Kalman filter combines models of cesium clock error dynamics with OMEGA phase timing measurements to estimate and control inter-transmitter synchronization offsets (both phase and phase rate) to an accuracy on the order of 1 µsec rms. Auxiliary algorithms perform OMEGA phase measurement preprocessing, including: compensation for propagation anomalies, reciprocal path phase differencing, automatic outlier rejection, dynamic measurement-quality weighting, and time-correlation modeling. Alternative timing measurements (including: satellite/TV, Loran-C, and portable clock) are utilized, as available, to synchronize the entire transmitter system to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)."
"A matrix-operator representation of parameter sensitivities is used to provide an algebraic \"structural\" analysis of local parameter identifiability in linear time-invariant ordinary differential equation systems. Necessary conditions for identifiability depend only upon the system matrices; no integrals must be computed; and arbitrary parametrization may be used. Relations to insensitivity are discussed, and design techniques are suggested which use the nonidentifiable (insensitive) subspace to systematically reduce the number of exciting parameters in individually designed parameter identification experiments. Finally, sufficiency conditions for zero-state identifiability are examined in terms of control inputs which continually excite the natural modes of the parameter sensitivities."
"Asymptotic minimax robust estimation of a location parameter as introduced by P. J. Huber is considered. This problem is closely related to recent developments in robust detection theory and robust recursive filtering for linear systems. For a given minimax location estimation problem two distinct estimates which are solutions are determined by the probability distribution Fo which has minimum Fisher information over the associated distribution set. A Lagrange multiplier technique is given for calculating Fo for a broad class of distribution sets. Existence and uniqueness conditions for Fo are given."
"This presentation is intended to introduce one to the Space Shuttle Mission, the aerodynamic characteristics one expects from the Orbiter vehicle and to what use it will be employed. Basically, the Shuttle Orbiter is employed as a booster in the ascent phase, an orbiting space station in the on-orbit phase, as a reentry vehicle, and finally a glider on the entry phase. The same vehicle must endure these roles for a hundred missions before overhaul. Obviously, trade-offs are made to a vehicle when it is required to perform these tasks. A sophisticated control configured design is necessary to perform these tasks well. Control system synthesis is an integral part of the vehicle design. The man-in-the-loop simulations on-going at NASA provide valuable control system evaluation. Astronauts are introduced to the ride, handling qualities, operability and redundancy management techniques and feed back valuable data to the designers. Finally, the useful role the Space Shuttle will serve mankind is explored. The Orbiter can carry (or bring back) up to 65,000 pounds to low Earth orbit. It can serve as a staging platform for high orbit missions, space platforms or satellite repair; or it can provide laboratory space for scientific experiments, manufacturing, and observatories."
"A multi-rate multi-loop digital control system is a special class of a time varying system which contains two or more sampling switches operating at different data rates and two or more signal flow loops. When the ratio of the different rates are integers (i. e,, in practice most often powers of two) it is possible to analyze a multi-rate multi-loop system by reducing it to an equivalent signal rate multiloop time invariant system. Three different modeling procedures for this class of systems are: (i) sampler decomposition in time domain, (ii) sampler decomposition in frequency domain, and (iii) hybrid state transition. In the first and the third methods, the multi-rate system is reduced to an equivalent single rate system with the largest sampling period, whereas in the second method, the multi-rate system is reduced to an equivalent single rate system with the smallest sampling period. In this paper, a methodology is developed to apply the frequency domain decomposition technique to large scale digital systems. Three assertions are given which provide methods to compute multi-rate system with state space techniques. The developed algorithm which has been incorporated in the DIGIKON-II program is applied to the Space Shuttle flight control system. The multi-rate results are developed for 2:1 and 4:1 sampling ratios."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the Space Shuttle Orbiter manual command augmentation (CAS) control law. The paper addresses the configuration as presently baselined for the approach/land test (ALT) program. The requirements and problems associated with the ALT CAS control mode as well as the design/analysis approach used with it are representative of those associated with the operational atmospheric flight. The pertinent stability and performance requirements are summarized from the specifications. These considerations then lead to the selection of feedbacks, gains and filters where the last opens up the question of digital filter design. Special features of the resultant control laws include provision for command signal limiting (CSL) and the mechanization of the pitch axis proportional plus integral control. Digital filter design techniques used in obtaining bending filters differ from those used in obtaining lower frequency filters for rigid body control. These techniques and the rationale for their choice are summarized."
"The degree of reliance a control system analyst can place on computer solutions of systems equations is critically dependent on the computational algorithms selected, and the care employed in programming to control error propagation. This paper describes characteristics of practical systems influencing the choice of algorithms and error control and offers suggested precautions. It is based on experience in the development of a system for linear analysis of large scale systems involving discrete control with multiple sampling rates."
"Aerospace programs such as the Space Shuttle increasingly demand that avionics be fault tolerant. This paper describes the concept used for sustaining two system failures in the Shuttle Flight Control System (FCS) using redundancy management of sensors as the specific area of emphasis. Moreover, an analytical approach is described which is capable of verifying performance on a statistical basis, addressing performance requirements concerned with . Avoidance of nuisance failures. . Detectability of faults. . Maximum vehicle transients incurred as a result of a failure. This approach will be the basis for preflight verification of Space Shuttle FCS redundancy management implemented in software."
"This paper establishes a mathematical model and a methodology for analyzing the statistical performance of redundant sensor systems. The particular problem of primary interest is the development of procedures for estimating the expected number of false trips in a mission. The general methods, however, are suitable for a wide variety of applications, including single-string designs. Considered here are the effects of various noise sources and the statistical variations caused by the allowed tolerances on the system parameters."
"Let P be the following nonlinear programming problem: given m+1 continuously differentiable convex maps f0 (.), f1(.),..., fm(.) from En into E, minimize f0(z) subject to fj(z) ≥ 0, j=1,2, ..., m. A well known approach for solving P consists of embedding P into a family of approximate problems P(α). Given α>0, the problem P(α) is to find a point z such that fj(z)≤0, j=1,2, ..., m and such that for every h in En there exists j in J(z, α), j depending on h, satisfying ⊽fj(z),h≥ 0, with J(z, α) = {jε{1,2, ...., m}|fj(z)+1/α α 0} u {0}. In general P(α) cannot be solved in a finite number of iterations and therefore one is obliged to use antizigzagging schemes of varying complexity. The purpose of this paper is to describe a class C of problems P such that the approximating problems P(α) may be solved in a finite number of steps."
"We present a class of algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems. In the algorithm non-negatively constrained quadratic programming subproblems are iteratively solved to obtain estimates of Lagrange multipliers and with these estimates a sequence of points which converges to the solution is generated. To achieve a superlinear rate of convergence the matrix appearing in the subproblem is required to be an approximate inverse of the Hessian of the Lagrangian or a penalty Lagrangian. Some well-known variable metric updates such as the BFGS update are employed to generate the matrix and the resulting algorithm converges locally with a superlinear rate."
"A quasi-Newton algorithm for minimizing a function subject to box constraints is described. Since our original motivation came from the optimization of electrical circuits, this algorithm is designed to tolerate errors in the function and gradient evaluations. Theorems are given to support the use of the symmetric rank one update."
"Computational techniques used to design and optimize the trajectories flown by the Atlas/Centaur launch vehicle are presented. The open-loop atmospheric guidance strategy and the closed-loop exoatmospheric pitch and yaw guidance equations are discussed breifly to indicate the control parameters available for optimization within the constraints of the current flight computer implementation. The full range of constraints that must be observed during the flight is discussed at length. The main portion of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the constrained optimization technique used, a method related to Hestenes' Method of Multipliers, (25) but using various formulas to update the multipliers. To the best of the author's Knowledge, no publications have appeared showing the applicability and advantages of multiplier methods to trajectory optimization problems. The author's experience has shown his variation of the Method of Multipliers to be almost twice as fast as competing penalty function methods. Finally, optimization of the HEAO-A direct-ascent trajectory is discussed. The HEAO-A mission demonstrates profile optimization to meet range safety, tracking, heating, structural integrity, and attitude rate constraints."
"The use of projections in public and private decisions is reviewed with emphasis on agricultural decisions. At the public level the decisions deal with agricultural policy, program and project problems and at the private level with the problems encountered by farm and agribusiness firm managers. There is a discussion of (1) the impact of increased competence in economics and econometrics on the use of specialized projections with respect to agriculture and (2) the credibility gap which has arisen among decision-makers with respect to all quantitative work. The reasons for this credibility gap reveal opportunities for systems scientists in modeling the domains of agrarian problems and further developing systems-science techniques to (1) include \"man components\" and (2) close the normative feedback loops required in iteratively and interactively defining and solving problems."
"Public and private policy decisions, program planning and management, and expenditures of limited federal and state funds affect food production capacity, commodity supply-demand, resource development and use, the environment, economic development and the world food situation. Providing a reasonable balance between production capacity and the need for food and fiber is the implied national goal. In dealing with the long-run aspects of these problems, public decisionmakers are increasingly turning to projections and analyses of alternative futures. Whereas we have traditionally studied the past to understand the present, we need to study the future to better manage the present and to better plan the future. Confronted with a multitude of unprecedented and inter-related global problems in population, the environment, food, and energy, decisionmakers need more and better information about alternatives, trade-offs, and impacts on social value functions."
"This paper presents a brief overview focusing on the model development, testing, and utilization by the Michigan State University Agricultural Sector Analysis and Simulation Projects team in Korea over the five-year period, 1971-1976. First the development of the Agricultural Sector Analysis and Simulation work at MSU and the scope of the project in Korea, including our multiple objectives of model development, institutionalization, and utilization, is discussed. Next is a section on the general systems simulation approach as practiced by the MSU team, with respect to philosophies, techniques, sources and kinds of data and information. The models are then presented, using block diagrams, with an explanation of the linkages and variable flows, performance variables, data requirements and policies which can be assessed. Finally, some lessons learned from the experience are detailed, with respect to credibility with decision makers, and utilization."
"Two analytic approaches used in studying the decline in farm numbers are compared. Conventional, empirical analysis is extended by the addition of a causal structure to describe the behavior of the United States Wheat Production System. Such a model, which incorporates the concepts of information feedback control theory, is a powerful tool which can aid in the development of future farm programs."
"The load and frequency control of a three-area interconnected power system consisting of 9 synchronous machines (described by a 98th order system) is studied. In this problem, the system is assumed to be subject to unknown constant disturbances, and it is desired to obtain if possible, robust decentralized controllers so that the frequency and tie-line power flow of the power system are regulated. The problem is solved by using some structural results recently obtained in decentralized control, in conjunction with a parameter optimization method which minimizes the dominant eigenvalue of the closed loop system. A minimum order robust decentralized controller which solves this problem, and also the general multi-area load and frequency control problem, is obtained."
"In order for primal-dual methods to be applicable to a constrained minimization problem it is necessary that restrictive convexity conditions are satisfied. In this paper we consider a procedure by means of which a nonconvex problem is convexified and transformed into one which can be solved with the aid of primal-dual methods. Under this transformation, separability of the type necessary for application of decomposition algorithms is preserved. This feature extends the range of applicability of such algorithms to nonconvex problems."
"A large class of engineering design problems including multivariable feedback systems, can be transcribed into the form P: min{f0(x)|gj(x)≤0 j = 1,.., q, jωεΩ max fj(x,ω)≤0, j = 1,..., m}, with each ϕj a bounded interval of the real line. In this paper we give several examples of such transcriptions, including that of an i.s.e., PID controller design for a single-input single-output system subject to a phase-margin constraint and a peak overshoot-settling time problem. We then present scaling procedures for the search vector in the Polak-Mayne [1] algorithm which solves P, as well as a new, self-scaling, algorithm for solving P. This new algorithm is related to the Pironneau-Polak [6] dual method of feasible directions. The use of scaling in such methods is most important since it leads to substantial savings in computing time."
"A rapidly convergent search technique for finding the root of a scalar equation is proposed. At each step the method requires the construction of the envelope of a certain class of functions. Constructing this envelope is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem with state space constraints. The major portion of the paper deals with this control problem."
"In this paper, the problem of routing connections through a three-stage connection network in presence Of fanout is considered. The assignment problem is viewed as a mapping of the input terminal set onto the output terminal set. An algorithm is presented which employs mapping operations to resolve blocking conflicts systematically as they are encountered. Relationships between the parameters of a 3-stage asymmetrical connection network which will minimize the number of switches and still leave the network rearrangeable, are also presented. The results from randomly generated output full and maximal assignments show that the algorithm is optimal for carefully designed networks."
"This paper is concerned with a tracking problem in which the target randomly changes its degree of maneuverability. An optimal filter cannot generally be mechanized for this problem because it has excessive computational requirements. Consequently, two suboptimal adaptive filtering techniques are investigated and compared against a non-adaptive filter design. One of the adaptive techniques is new. Performance and sensitivity studies are presented which show the advantages and disadvantages of each filter. The results demonstrate that, in some situations, adaptive designs can provide a large improvement in system tracking performance over an optimized non-adaptive design."
"The degree of roll and/or pitch stabilization in automated 2-D shipboard radars has far reaching impact on detection coverage, track acquisition range, tracking accuracy, and report integrity as well as on cost for a ship operating in a high sea state. This paper analyzes and compares these performance parameters for several hypothetical radars operating in a high sea state for a spectrum of mechanical stabilization capabilities and for a variety of pseudo-stabilization algorithms and responsive tracking algorithm designs which could be included in the operational program. The use of mechanical roll stabilization provides the best compromise of performance and cost among the cases considered. The additional use of pseudo-stabilization in the computer and modified tracking equations responsive to instantaneous ship pitch and roll provides up to a twofold further accuracy improvement. Lack of mechanical stabilization resulted in drastically reduced acquisition range for close in targets and much degraded accuracy."
"The purpose of this paper is to examine several Kalman filter algorithms that can be used for state estimation with a multiple sensor system. In a synchronous data collection system, the statistically independent data blocks can be processed in parallel or sequentially, or similar data can be compressed before processing; in the linear case these three filter types are optimum and their results are identical. When measurements from each sensor are statistically independent, the data compression method is shown to be computationally most efficient, followed by the sequential processing; the parallel processing is least efficient."
 "Results are presented of an analysis of angle-only track in a ballistic missile defense (BMD) adjunct role. It is demonstrated that a ballistic trajectory is observable with an angle-only sensor mounted on an observation platform moving on a ballistic trajectory when the proper tracking filter is used to minimize the effects of observational bias. Results are shown on initialization of the angle-only filter using both deterministic schema and external satellite data and sensitivity to initial error is discussed. Possible uses of the method are given for BMD application."
"This paper considers the problem of estimating the state variables and maneuvering parameters for a re-entry vehicle. The non-linear filtering results based upon a tuned nine state extended Kalman filter (for realtime applications) are compared with those obtained by a linearized fixed interval smoother (for non-realtime applications) using Monte Carlo simulation experiments."
"In this paper we focus our attention on the following model: Suppose that a two-dimensional random field ⤷(t1,t2) is observed on a rectangle 0 ≤ t1 ≤ T1, 0 ≤ t2 ≤ T2. We assume that the observation consists of a signal x(t1,t2) plus an additive white Gaussian noise, i.e., ⤷(t1,t2) = x(t1,t2) + n(t1,t2) where n is a white Gaussian noise. We shall consider the following two problems: (a) What is the likelihood ratio as a function of the observation with respect to the situation where ⤷ is itself a white Gaussian noise? (b) For what models of the signal x will recursive filtering be possible? What is the nature of recursion in this case, and what are the resulting formulas? In this paper we shall summarize the results which have been obtained to date on the two problems of detection and filtering stated above."
"The theory of two-dimensional spectral factorization is reviewed in the context of recursive modeling. The role of the Markov random field in recursive image modeling is then presented, Since spectral factorization in two-or higher-dimensions generally results in infinite order factors, it is necessary to perform Markov modeling after spectral factorization. The above concepts are then applied to the problem of Kalman filtering of images."
"A new approximate vertically causal image representation is developed and employed in deriving several line-by-line recursive restoration procedures for images degraded by blur and additive noise. The optimal and two practical suboptimal restoration Schemesstrip restoration and constrained optimal restoration-are included."
"Estimation of boundaries of objects in noisy images is considered. The objects and the background are characterized statistically. The noise is assumed additive and Gaussian. Recursive nonlinear MMS estimators are derived. Applications to binary pictures are illustrated."
"This paper considers the problem of developing recursive filter structures capable of optimal filtering of two dimensional signals. The inability of recently proposed structures to achieve optimal performance is discussed and the required optimal filter structure is presented and shown to be nonrecursive in the normally defined sense. Asymptotic state estimators which retain a recursive structure are developed along with the conditions which must be satisfied for these estimators to operate in a minimum mean square error sense."
"The problem of approximating a bandlimited but otherwise arbitrary signal by a free solution to a linear, time-invariant, differential equation is solved. Optimal solutions for the equation parameters are derived for equations of any dynamic order. Applications are discussed and examples in state reconstruction and inverse filtering in the presence of unknown disturbances are given."
"This paper uses high order sensitivity analysis for the determination of bias and mean square errors of general estimators with finite and infinite samples. The errors in maximum likelihood estimates are analyzed in detail. It is Shown that in finite data, the maximum likelihood estimates may be substantially biased and possess mean square errors substantially higher than Cramer-Rao bounds. The errors caused by inaccurate models are determined, leading to a technique for selection of parameters in practical estimation problems."
"In Reference 1, Friedland describes a very interesting and practical procedure for estimating the states of a linear process in the presence of a constant but unknown bias vector."
"The observer design procedures of Luenberger [1], Fortmann and Williamson [3], and Murdoch [4] are studied in the realization theory context, and it is shown that these procedures are associated with specific realization algorithms. The realization approach to observer design allows the evaluation and comparison of the three techniques, and in doing so provides considerable insight into the structure of observers."
"A joint detection-estimation scheme is derived for the estimation of the state of a linear system subject to white noise disturbances whose covariance function is known up to a parameter. The unknown parameter is assumed to satisfy at least one of several bounds indicating different levels of uncertainty about the model. Since no a priori information about the parameter, other than the bounds is known, a weighted minimax criterion is used. Function space techniques are used to determine the solution."
"We give simple proofs of formulas for converting linear least-squares filtered and smoothed estimates derived for one set of initial conditions to estimates valid for some other set. These are then used to study the possible advantages of first deliberately mischoosing the initial conditions so as to allow computational benefits to be obtained by using certain fast algorithms. In the course of this application we also obtain a new \"dual\" set of Chandrasekhar equations that provide a fast algorithm for fixed-point smoothing."
"In this paper the asymptotic normality of a large class of prediction error estimators is established. (Prediction error identification methods were introduced in [1] and further developed in [2] and [3].) The observed processes in this paper are assumed to be stationary and ergodic and the parameterized process models are taken to be non-linear regression models. In the gaussian case the results presented in this paper constitute substantial generalizations of previous results concerning the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for (i) processes of independent random variables [9,4] and (ii) Markov processes [5]; these results also generalize previous results on the asymptotic normality of least squares estimators for autoregressive moving average processes [6,7]. The asymptotic normality theorem gives formulae for the covariances of the asymptotic distributions of the parameter estimation errors arising from the specified class of prediction error identification methods. Employing these formulae it is demonstrated that the prediction error method using the determinant of the residual error covariance matrix as loss function is asymptotically efficient with respect to the specified class of prediction error estimators regardless of the distribution of the observed processes."
"This paper describes a new approach to the development of simple and efficient state observation schemes for large-scale systems described as Interconnections of several low-order subsystems. The study is conducted within a decomposition-decentralization framework and consists of obtaining Suitable modifications of a decentralized Observation scheme comprising of a set of local observers designed on the basis of the dynamics of the decoupled subsystems. The modifications sought are required to ensure a desired convergence rate for the overall observation scheme and generally involve the use of additional inputs, which account for the interconnection effects, into the local observers. The most noteworthy feature of the present results is that almost all the necessary computations are conducted at the subsystem level only, thus leading to simple and practicable observer designs."
"We consider an arbitrary interconnection of linear, time-invariant, distributed, multivariable subsystems; each subsystem is represented either by a strictly proper rational transfer function or by a finite sum of pure delay terms. Allowing inputs to be applied to any interconnection point, we show that, except for a special case, the input-output transfer function of such a system is in a class extensively studied in the literature. Next we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for input-output stability. An example illustrates the application of the test."
"This paper derives methods for the calculation of optimal stabilization policies under the assumption that monetary and fiscal control are exercised by separate authorities who may have different objectives. Each authority minimizes its own quadratic cost functional subject to the constraint of a linear econometric model. Nash solution strategies are calculated for this discrete-time differential game, both in the context of open-loop and closed-loop behavior (in the closed-loop framework each authority can continually revise his policy in response to the evolving strategy of the other authority). The results are applied to a small econometric model, and show how the degree of fiscal or monetary control depends on the particular conflict situation, and how conflicting policies are \"sub-optimal\" in comparison with coordinated policies."
"This paper presents a computational approach to the problem of determining the optimal constant feedback gain matrices for a particular decentralized controller structure. The technique presented utilizes an extension of the concept of ε-coupling, which has been used successfully for large-scale centralized structures. The results reported herein represent a refinement of the authors' previous work in developing decentralized controllers, into an algorithmic format. The effectiveness of this technique is discussed, and guidelines for its use are given. The algorithm is also applied to determine the optimal feedback gains for a two-area power system, and the performance of the resulting controller is compared to that of other types of decentralized controllers having the same structure."
"A two-dimensional pursuit-evasion game, characterized by a difficulty level intermediate between that of the «Simple Motions Game» (with freely and instantaneously orientable velocities) and that of the «Game of Two Cars» (with lower bounds on curvature radii), is formulated and then solved by an approach both analytical and numerical. Each player's velocity has a constant modulus. The meneuvers (turns) are penalized by introducing, in the performance index, an integral term of the squared velocity vector angular rate. The performance index to be mini-maximized for this zero-sum game than takes the form: J = tf-t0 + 1/M1 ∫t 0 t fω2 2 dt with t0, tf : initial and final times ω : velocity vector angular rate 1/M ⩾ 0 : penalty coefficient ()1 : related to pursuer P (minimizing player) ()2 : related to evader E (maximizing player). The problem formulated in this way is more realistic than the «Simple Motions Game» i.e. «Simple Pursuit Game», since it takes into account the maneuverability limitation; on the other hand, it is less complex than the «Game of Two Cars», because the trajectories curvatures change more continuously than in this latter game, in which appears a great number of switches, i.e. sudden, maximum amplitude, direction changes."
"An optimal production policy in a job shop queue specifies, for minimum cost, the number of servers, amount of overtime, and the maximum queue length allowed before subcontracting takes place. This paper examines the development and application of such a policy."
"The problem of controlling a stochastic system containing constant but unknown parameters over a finite horizon is considered. The expected value of a quadratic scalar performance index, with respect to the prior Statistics of the parameters of the system, is minimized. We propose to fix the structure of the estimator-controller end choose the feedback gain, the parameter estimates, and filter gain such that the performance index is minimized. This procedure is attractive when the horizon is short but it also incorporates adaptation to long term changes in the statistics of the plant parameters."
"Although procedures exist for finding the cost variance of an optimally controlled stochastic, jump parameter system, the computational complexity inherent in these procedures impedes their general use. An algorithm is provided here that will provide the stationary cost variance with significantly less effort. An example illustrating the mechanics of the algorithm is presented."
"S is taken to be a discrete linear dynamical system. The matrices A(k+1,k), B(k+1,k) and C(k+1) describing S are assumed to be unknown. M is a linear model of S described by known matrices Am(k+1,k), Bm(k+1,k) and Cm(k+1). The dimension of A is permitted to exceed Am. A known error bound θ describes the approximation of S by M, i.e., it is assumed that a bound is available on the error between the outputs of M and S corresponding to the same input. A target set Yt is said to be strongly reachable from S (at time k) if a control sequence can be found such that the output of S remains within Yt from time k until the terminal time N. Using the theory of convex analysis, necessary and sufficient conditions are described for strong reachability of Yt. The target set reachability problem for deterministic systems (θ = 0) and norm uncertain systems (θ depends linearly on the norm of control) are considered as special cases of the main result."
"The paper treats general convergence conditions for a class of algorithms for finding the minima of a function f(x) when f(x) is of unknown (or partly unknown) form - and when only noise corrupted observations can be taken. Such problems occur frequently in adaptive processes, and in many applications to statistics and estimation. The algorithms are of the stochastic approximation type. Several forms are dealt with - for estimation in either discrete or continuous time, with and without side constraints. The algorithms can be considered as sequential Monte Carlo methods for systems optimization. The main purpose of the paper is to show how the theory of weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures can be used to reduce the convergence problem to \"basic\" elements, and to yield, quickly and efficiently, a convergence theorem under rather general conditions on the noise. Many extensions are possible, and only a few applications are considered here. The ideas are useful for establishing deeper (than the usual) results on rates of convergence [17]. Extensions to problems where the parameters are abstract valued is also possible. We mention also that a study of the numerical properties of several algorithms for constrained SA (stochastic approximation) appear in [18]."
"This paper presents a method of converting a stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic one, where probability distributions on the state space of the stochastic model are taken as states in the deterministic model. Relations between policies and rewards of the two models are given and counterparts to known deterministic results are developed for the stochastic model. A novel feature of our framework is the enlargement of the set of admissible control laws to include universally measurable policies rather than only Borel measurable policies. This feature together with a new measurable selection theorem allow us to dispense with the notions of p-optimality of Blackwell and Strauch [11,6] and the notion of p-essential infimum of Striebel [12], and obtain all results in a form comparable to that for deterministic problems."
"A generalization of the O.L.F.O. technique is proposed for the design of feedback controls of discrete linear systems with random input and state dependent noise. The control strategy is optimized at any time by assuming for the future, instead of an open loop, a feedback structure with given state estimator. The choice of the optimum estimator and of the control strategy for the future is approached with an original recursive algorithm which generates a monotonic convergent sequence of upper bounds of the cost-to- -go (CUB)."
"Convergence-stability of the innovation process is discussed in the case of convergence in probability. Suboptimal form of the Kalman-gain is given when the convergence is with probability one in mean square sense, as well."
"Given the Covariance function R(i, j), 1≤i, j≤N, of a discrete time vector valued random process y(i), we consider the problem of approximating the process realization with a fixed (lower) order model. The approximate model is chosen so that statistical bounds are guaranteed in the estimation of the process. A sequential design procedure as N grows, based on the minimization of an approximation measure, is proposed in the paper and conditions for convergence of the algorithm when N→∞ are indicated."
"An agricultural market model which includes the effects of government support and stockpiling programs has been developed as a component of AGRIMOD, a dynamic simulation model of the U.S. food production system. The model is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. The concept of a Support supply function is introduced to deal with discontinuities in the supply caused by government policies. Finally, a scaling method is developed to achieve rapid convergence."
"How large should a world grain reserve be in order to stabilize grain supplies through good or lean years of production? The paper discusses how to conceive of the institutions through which grain is produced and used; how to size a grain reserve with respect to multiple objectives; and how to assure reliable performance even during a series of sequential production shortfalls. An analytical technique is described, based upon tools from synthetic hydrology, order statistics, and multiobjective programming. Initial numerical results for sizing a world grain reserve are presented."
"A scheme for extending linear differential-difference equations from a Euclidean phase space into a Banach phase space. This is not a new idea. For example Travis and Web [9] have made this extension for autonomous systems involving partial differential equations of parabolic type. The technique presented in this discussion is based on the ability to express solutions of the problem in terms of certain transformations which are the analogues of the fundamental matrices of the finite dimensional theory (see e.g. [1] or [7])."
"A description of basic controllability results for control systems of linear differential-difference equations is given. Applications of these results to optimization theory are illustrated by a discussion of a quadratic optimal (minimum L2-norm) control problem, and an optimal time problem."
"Survey of currently available theory for systems the evolution of which can be described by semigroups of operators of class CO. Connection between the concepts of stabilizability and detectability and the problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions to the operator Riccati equation. Examples and Open problems."
"Several concepts of function space controllability and observability of linear retarded systems are re-examined from the point of view of abstract infinite-dimensional systems with state space Rn×L2. It is shown that the controllability of all the eigenmodes, hence feedback stabilizability with an arbitrary exponential decay rate, is implied by a property weaker than the approximate controllability in Rn×L2. Verifiable criteria for this type of controllability and for a related concept of observability are given, along with several examples."
"This paper concerns the optimal control of a system where the state is modeled by a homogeneous diffusion process in R1. Each time the system is controlled a fixed cost is incurred as well as a cost which is proportional to the magnitude of the control applied. In addition to the cost of control, there are holding or carrying costs incurred which are a function of the state of the system. Sufficient conditions are found to determine the optimal control for an infinite horizon problem. The optimal policy is one of \"impulse\" control originally introduced by Bensoussan and Lions [2] where the system is controlled only a finite number of times in any bounded time interval and the control requires an instantaneous finite change in the state variable. The issue of the existence of such controls is not addressed."
"An infinite-dimensional model is given for the generation of gyroscopic noise, which exhibits power spectral density proportional to (1/f) over a wide frequency range. The optimal filter is given for separating a statistically described signal form additive gyroscopic noise, using discrete-time observations. This filter is expressed as a discrete-time infinite-dimensional Kalman-Bucy filter, with an associated Riccati covariance operator equation. Sufficient conditions are specified such that this Kalman-Bucy filter will possess various desired properties."
"A common approach to matching two scenes is the use of an area cross-correlation measure. This measure is proportional to the root-mean-square difference between the corresponding pixel intensities for the two scenes. In practice, it is often found that the magnitude of this measure at the correct match position may be rather low, and that the maximum value appears at an incorrect match position. This problem of false-fixing results from differences between the reference and sensed scene in their respective range, viewing angle, illumination, contrast level, and imaging sensor type. In this paper we present a comparison and trade-offs between correlation and alternative matching techniques that do not suffer from the same weaknesses as those of correlation. A specific example of a matching scheme is also discussed that uses a scene model based on local structural features from the scene. The results of such a matching scheme on a set of two representative images are presented."
"This paper presents results of a theoretical study of a simple radar edge detection correlation approach. Several candidate edge correlation algorithms are described. The paper presents results of a theoretical evaluation of one particular candidate correlation algorithm and verification of the edge correlation concept is provided through a presentation of correlation performance obtained using real radar imagery."
"The problem of matching two images of the same scene produced by different sensors under different viewing conditions is important in many applications. A hierarchical method which is logarithmetically efficient is presented in this paper. Experimental results are presented for matching an image region corrupted by noise and for matching images from optical and radar sensors. The significance of this approach is that scene matching can be accomplished even in cases which are difficult for humans or standard correlation techniques and may be accomplished with greatly reduced computations."
"This paper discusses the development and application of recursive processing techniques to correlation guidance (signature matching for navigation purposes). Simulation results are presented to characterize the performance of the proposed algorithms. Implementation issues including acquisition, reference map storage, and scene selection are also Investigated."
"An adaptive estimator solution to a non-linear state estimation problem is presented. The specific problem being addressed is that of tracking a maneuvering target in three-dimensional space by spherical observations (radar data). Two techniques are presented, both of which model target maneuvers as a semi-Markov process. This paper describes the two techniques and presents computer simulation results. This work was supported by NSWC Dahlgren Lab., project no. 382922-1."
"A brief sketch is given of recent work by this author and by M. Fliess on generalized inputs. The aim is to develop a theory in which stochastic differential equations driven by white noise can be solved for each sample path. The results obtained so far are complete for the case of equations driven by a scalar white noise, as well as for bilinear systems driven by vector-valued inputs. The main idea is to regard the \"sample paths of a white noise process\" as \"generalized functions\" in a sense different from the theory of distributions. A representation of these generalized functions as formal power series is discussed."
"In the setting of abstract automata, it is shown that a feedback regulator must incorporate a dynamic model of the exosystem ('outside world') to which the regulator is designed to respond. The result is based on general, lattice-theoretic definitions of the concepts of feedback and observability."
"Enough of the language of algebraic geometry is developed to state the \"dominant morphism theorem.\" Two applications are developed, pole placement and Gaussian Elimination."
"In this paper we present some new results on controllability and realization of discrete-time, finite-dimensional, constant, polynomial systems. We study the realization problem of both systems linear-in-state and systems quadratic-in-state. Explicit existence criteria for span-canonical realizations as well as space isomorphism theorems are obtained. Combining the methods used for realization of systems linear-in-state and systems quadratic-in-state we can realize any polynomial systems which may be realized by construction of a generalized Hankel matrix. A sufficient condition as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability of polynomial systems are given."
"High order conditions are given to determine whether or not a specified reference trajectory of a control system is, at each time t, in the interior of the set of points attainable at time t. The conditions are derived via differential geometric methods; the test can be viewed as a high dimensional analog of the two dimensional Green's theorem approach. A real valued function is constructed; it's sign can be used to determine the desired property of the reference trajectory. Lie theory is then used to expand this function in a Taylor series making the test algebraic (computational)."
"The concept of angles of inclination between subspaces is used in an algorithm for the numerical determination of observability and controllability indices. These angles can be determined in an efficient and numerically stable way and provide an intuitively appealing quantitative measure of the degree of controllability or observability of a linear system."
"The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a navigation system which relies on range and range-rate information between satellites and users. This information must be processed by the user to determine his position and velocity. The following computer algorithms for GPS users are compared: 1) a deterministic solution to the nonlinear range and range-rate equations, 2) two deterministic solution using the linearized equations, and 3) a eight-state Kalman filter solution. These conparisons are based on computer operations required, navigation accuracy neglecting noise and navigation accuracy with realistic noise inputs. A simulated flight of a C5A aircraft is used in these comparisons. The deterministic algorithms all give the same accuracies with noisey input data. The simplest algorithm is a linearized deterministic version that sequencially solves for position and velocity with a resulting mean position error of 324 feet and a mean velocity error of .23 ft/ sec. Use of a kalman filter reduces the mean Position errors to 117 feet with small improvement in the velocity estimate, but a 12-fold increase in required computer operations."
"In some laser transmitting applications where system performance requires maximum intensity at the receiver plane, it is necessary to expand and focus the laser wavefront. Maximum intensity occurs when the wavefront focal length and the range to the receiver plane are the same. This paper considers the use of an extended Kalman filter and an iterated extended Kalman filter to estimate the range to the receiver plane, the focal length of the laser system, and the scale factor uncertainty in target reflectivity characteristics. The information can be then used to set the focal length of the laser to obtain maximum intensity. The laser is a truncated Gaussian, focused and apertured beam."
"This paper will describe some of the design tradeoff studies being performed at the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center in support of the development of technologies for a low cost NAVSTAR/GPS user terminal. Particular emphasis is being placed on achieving higher accuracy in position and velocity without the aid of inertial navigation systems. The role of estimation theory in the design and analysis of navigation algorithms is emphasized via the covariance and simulation analyses to support hardware-software tradeoffs."
"This paper considers the application of an Annular Momentum Control Device (AMCD) to both fine pointing and large-angle maneuvering of a large space telescope (LST). The AMCD, which consists principally of a spinning rim suspended in noncontacting electromagnetic bearings, represents a new development in momentum storage devices. A nonlinear mathematical model of the AMCD/LST system is derived. An optimal stochastic fine-pointing controller is designed via-LQG theory and the minimum-energy maneuvering problem is solved, via a gradient technique. Number of state variable and control variable constraints, as well as all trigonometric nonlinearities, are considered in the latter part."
"The optimal adaptive estimator structure for a class of doubly stochastic Poisson processes (DSPP) is presented. Moment assumptions are used to obtain a quasi-optimal structure. Examples are given including applications to adaptive optics."
"Numerical characteristics of various Kalman filter algorithms are illustrated with a realistic orbit determination study. The case study of this paper highlights the numerical deficiencies of the conventional and stabilized Kalman algorithms, Computational errors associated with these algorithms are found to be so large as to obscure important mismodeling effects and thus cause misleading estimates of filter accuracy. The positive result of this study is that the UD covariance factorization algorithm has excellent numerical properties and is computationally efficient, having CPU costs that differ negligibly from the conventional Kalman costs. Accuracies of the U-D filter using single precision arithmetic consistently match the double precision reference results. Numerical stability of the UD filter is further demonstrated by its insensitivity to variations in the a priori statistics."
"The problem is considered of regulating in the face of parameter uncertainty the output of a linear time-invariant system subjected to disturbance and reference signals. This problem has been treated by other researchers. In this paper a new, simple algebraic solution is given."
"The new concept of \"minimal structural controllability\" relating to structural controllability is defined and studied. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a multi-input sturctured system to be minimal structurally controllable are given. The results are expressed in both graph theoretical and algebraic statements, where their derivation also provide an alternate proof on structural controllability of multi-input case [1], [2]."
"Recent studies in pole placement have investigated the degree of flexibility available when feedback is constrained to constant gains on the output variables of a linear system. This paper uses pencil theory to provide a structural basis for determining the available degree of flexibility in choosing coefficients of the closed-loop characteristic equation of an output feedback system. Previous results are verified. Extensions are introduced to increase the lower bound on placeable poles and indicate under what conditions additional poles can be placed."
"We present a generalized resultant matrix and a fast algorithm for testing the coprimeness of two polynomial matrices, extracting their great common divisor, finding the McMillan degree and the observability indices of the associated minimal realization."
"Some new results involving Jury's inners are described. It is shown how all the leading principal minors of ana arbitrary square matrix can be expressed in terms of the inners of a single matrix. This possesses a left triangle of zeros when the original matrix is in lower Hessenberg form. Application of this construction are made to orthogonal polynomial representations and to zero location theorems. The parallel concept of outers is described and some related novel forms of matrix symmetry are introduced."
"Generalized Bezoutian and Sylvester matrices are defined and discussed in this short paper. The relationship between these two forms matrices is established. It is shown that the McMillan degree of a real rational function can be ascertained by checking the rank of either one of these generalized matrices formed using a polynomial matrix fraction decomposition of the prescribed transfer function matrix. Earlier established results by Rowe and Munro are obtained as a special case. Several theorems related to the rank testing and other properties of the generalized matrices are discussed and various research problems are listed in the conclusion."
"An algorithm for computing the canonical form of a singular pencil is presented. This algorithm, which is based on well known linear algebra techniques, offers efficiency and error analysis advantages over previous algorithms presented by Thorp and Gantmacher. These results are useful in exposing the structure of linear multivariable systems."
"Recursive algorithms for the solution of linear least-squares estimation problems have been based mainly on state-space models. It has been know, however, that such algorithms exist for stationary time-series, using input-output descriptions (e.g., covariance matrices). We introduce a way of classifying stochastic processes in terms of their \"distance\" from stationarity that leads to a derivation of an efficient Levinson-type algorithm for arbitrary (nonstationary) processes. By adding structure to the covariance matrix, these general results specialize to state-space type estimation algorithms. In particular, the Chandrasekhar equations are shown to be the natural descendants of the Levinson algorithm."
"Recursive identification algorithms are of great interest in control and estimation problems, and related areas such as recursive least squares- and adaptive methods. Recently we have shown how a certain shift invariance inherent in many estimation and control problems can be exploited to obtain fast algorithms that often require orders of magnitude less computations than presently available methods to compute optimal gains. We have developped fast algorithms for a variety of presently available identification methods as well as new ones that require computer time and storage (or hardware) per measurement only proportional to the number of model parameters, compared to the square of the number of parameters for previous methods. Since parameter identification can be formulated as a state estimation problem, optimal filtering results can be applied. In particular we would like to attract attention to alternatives, such as square-root methods and their last versions or ladder forms using partial correlations that have several computational and numerical advantages over the more commonly used methods."
"Parameter-error equilibrium for MRAS identification is examined. For a particular discrete-time MRAS design, both geometric and algebraic representations for the equilibrium subspace are obtained in terms of the unknown plant parameters and the input sequence."
"An on-line minimum variance parameter identifier is developed which embodies both accuracy and computational efficiency. The formulation results in a linear estimation problem with both additive and multiplicative noise. The resulting filter which utilizes both the covariance of the parameter vector itself and the covariance of the error in identification is proven to be mean square convergent and mean square consistent. The MV parameter identification scheme is then used to construct a stable state and parameter estimation algorithm."
"This paper considers the parameter identification of nonlinear systems using Hammerstein model and in the presence of correlated output noise. Existing identification methods are all iterative. The proposed method, called MSLS, is a noniterative four-stage least square solution procedure. Therefore, it is computationally simpler. The estimates so obtained are statistically consistent. Two examples are included to demonstrate the utility of this method."
"This paper presents the results of studies performed for the verification and parameter identification of a low-order power plant model from actual operating data. In this paper, we postulate a model of a boiler based on physical principles and using actual data from a power plant, identify the unknown parameters of the system using a maximum likelihood identification algorithm."
"Stationary stochastic inputs are generated from linear processes of the autoregressive moving average type. Since the spectral density of such a process is nonzero everywhere, this belongs to the class of admissible signals satisfying identifiability requirements. We obtain a characterization of the optimal signals in terms of their spectral densities using the results on asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of Toeplitz matrices. These signals belong to the general class of random inputs that can be generated using standard instrumentation consisting of delay lines and white noise generator."
"Consider a siscrete time system or process with i.i.d. outputs, X1,X2,... The distribution of Xi's is characterized by some unknown parameter, θ which is an element of θ, a subset of Z+, the positive integers. We propose to identify the parameter θ with an automaton which is realized by the following algorithm: The Xi's are observed sequentially. At instant i, a current best estimate (CBE) of θεθis generated, based on Xi alone. The best estimate to date (BED) of θ, at any instant, will be the particular element of θ which was previously the CBE of θ for the greatest number of consecutive instants. In the implementation of the algorithm, the state of te automaton will consist of the following four elements: the best estimate to date; the maximum number of consecutive times that this BED was the CBE of θ; the current best estimate of θ based on the latest value of Xi (= candidate for BED); and the number of consecutive times to date that this value has been the CBE of θ. It is shown that the BED converges strongly to the correct parameter. The following three specific applications are discussed: 1) Identification of the most probable value of a single sample from a set of discrete i.i.d. random variables. 2) Identification of the parameter of an observed sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. 3) Identification of the parameters of a moving average process. (Notice that the observations of the system output in this case are not i.i.d.). The rate of convergence of the algorithm is shown to exceed that of other proposed recursive algorithms [1] for parameter identification. Furthermore, the amount of memory required is shown to grow as log log i, a rate significantly slower than that required by other algorithms. It is also shown that for a very large class of systems, convergence of parameter estimates is impossible without acess to an unbounded memory."
"Using a hyperstable identification algorithm, this paper experimentally demonstrates the feasibility of real time system identification on an inexpensive 8 bit microprocessor."
"In [1] Segall introduces a state space model and associated optimal control problem for dynamic routing of messages in a data communication network. The optimal control problem is completely linear with state and control variable inequality constraints. In this paper we report on progress in solving the optimal control problem for a feed-back solution. In particular, we describe an approach for determining the feedback solution when all the inputs to the network are constant in time. For networks which have only a single destination (multiple sources) it is found that the approach has some appealing simplifying properties. The details underlying the approach described here are presented in Moss [2]."
"Data communication networks generally contain routing tables at each of the nodes of the network. We consider the routing tables at a given node to specify the fraction of traffic for each destination that should travel over each of the outgoing links from the given node. An iteration algorithm is presented which, when applied at each node using update information from adjoining nodes, converges to the routing tables that minimize average delay in the network for stationary input statistics. The algorithm has the property that the traffic to each destination is guaranteed to be loop free at each iteration of the algorithm. Several kinds of loop freedom and their implications are discussed."
"In this talk we focus on the application of analytical techniques to the study of two critical and interrelated control problems in data communication networks. These are, respectively, congestion control and adaptive, routing. Both of these problem areas may be subsumed under the general question of optimum resource allocation in data networks. In essence the basic problem is that of appropriately allocating the system resources (for example, nodal buffers and channel capacity) so as to maintain a desired throughput in the network at a given cost, with as small a time delay as possible. Other criteria exist as well, and some of these may in fact be mutually incompatible."
"The development of dynanic simulation models promises to provide policy makers with a quick-response tool for analyzing the effects of alternative policies for a 10-20 year time horizon. A general conceptual framework for such models is described. Then a brief description of AGRIMOD, a model for evaluating agricultural (e.g. grain reserves, exports) and natural resource (e.g. energy) policies that have an impact on the U.S. food production and consumption system is given."
"A comprehensive systems framework for materials policy analysis, the Reference Materials System (RMS), has been developed and is described in this paper. Specifically, the RMS provides a systematic approach to organizing engineering processtype information regarding material flows, energy requirements, costs, and environmental impacts corresponding to various materials on all processes ranging from extraction of resources through their refinement, transportation, fabrication, installation, and maintenance at the point of end use, as well as recycling. This system can be used for the assessment of material technologies, substitutions and policies, and has been applied to assess the role of renewable materials as substitutes for energy-intensive nonrenewables."
"Describes a computerized planning system useful for examining the physical, economic, and environmental consequences of alternative wildland use decisions. The system consists of a set of simulation models linked to a geographic data base by an information Storage and retrieval subsystem. System structure is discussed in the context of an integrated system model developed to facilitate an evaluation of the environmental consequences of alternative land uses and manipulations at varying scales of space-time resolution. Applications of the system are briefly discussed. While the models performed satisfactorily it is clear that decisionmakers consider much more than that which can ever be incorporated into a model structure at the present. Further, results demonstrate that often there is little incentive for decision makers to utilize models unless they are tailor made, easy to use and compatible with existing institutional patterns."
"Comparative evaluation of seven insensitive synthesis techniques applied to the control of the longitudinal axis and symmetric flexure modes of the C-5A is described. These techniques have the common goal of achieving insensitivity to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. For this comparison the \"complete\" model was assumed to consist of rigid body dynamics, fifteen flexure modes, unsteady aerodynamics, gust dynamics, and first order actuators for two control inputs. Thirteen flexure modes and the unsteady aerodynamics were treated as neglected dynamics. Dynamic pressure, structural frequency and damping, and the stability derivative Mw were treated as uncertain parameters. Design specifications consisted of a transient response criterion, statistical response criteria, eigenvalue criteria and stability margins. A nominal controller designed without regard to sensitivity served as a benchmark for performance comparisons of the insensitive controllers."
"A practical control design methodology for turbine engine control synthesis is presented. The procedure utilizes elements of linear theory and optimal control synthesis to produce practical, implementable digital controllers for modern, high performance, aircraft turbine engines. The advanced technology, F100 turbofan engine, multivariable digital controller is used as an example."
"Using linear-optimal estimation and control techniques, digital-adaptive control laws have been designed for a tandemrotor helicopter which is equipped for fully automatic flight in terminal area operations. Two distinct discrete-time control laws are designed to interface with velocity-command and attitude-command guidance logic, and each incorporates proportional-integral compensation for non-zero-set-point regulation, as well as reduced-order Kalman filters for sensor blending and noise rejection. Adaptation to flight condition is achieved with a novel gain-scheduling method based on correlation and regression analysis. The linear-optimal design approach is found to be a valuable tool in the development of practical multivariable control laws for vehicles which evidence significant coupling and insufficient natural stability."
"The use of optimal control techniques in the design of flight experiments employing the X-22A variable stability V/STOL aircraft is discussed. To emphasize the evolution of optimal control methodologies from the specialist's domain to a general design tool, the discussion concentrates on the application of existing procedures rather than on new theoretical developments. In particular, three different applications of the linear quadratic control theory are outlined, and flight and ground simulation results discussed, to demonstrate practical design answers which may be determined with these procedures."
"Control theoretic techniques are applied to develop two new models for predicting human operator performance when monitoring an automatically controlled system. In one case it is assumed that the human monitors the instruments in order to rapidly detect failures. The second approach assumes that the instruments are sampled to best reconstruct the system status information. The relation of these models to existing prediction schemes, e.g., equal attention and the Sender's model is explored. It is concluded that a combination of failure detection and status estimation models offers the best potential for human operator application."
 "Most computerized traffic control systems that are now operational use a central computer to perform virtually all data processing tasks. These systems operate satisfactorily, but it is believed that this system design approach is now stretched to its limit of practical capability. The recent availability of economical microprocessors and their successful application to traffic signal controllers suggests that investigations should be conducted into the formulation of traffic control system concepts that make full use of microprocessor capabilities and thereby identify improved systems for future applications, particularly those that relate to the concept of traffic management systems that is currently in favor. This paper describes a Multilevel Distributed System (MLDS) concept designed to meet future traffic control and traffic management system requirements as currently envisioned."
"Today the automobile industry is facing unprecedented technical challenges in its attempts to meet the severe and conflicting demands of improved fuel economy and exhaust emission performance. Part of the solution to these problems resides in developing improved engine controls for such variables as air-fuel ratio, ignition timing, and exhaust gas recirculation. This paper defines the engine control problem in terms familiar to control systems specialists and suggests the structure of a solution. This problem is quite complex and at worst is nonlinear, time varying, and stochastic as well as involving multiple input and output variables. In view of the above factors, as well as the fundamental trade-off between fuel and exhaust emissions, and environmental and system parameter variations, the use of closed loop optimal and/or adaptive controllers is proposed. Improved sensor and actuator technology as well as adequate mathematical models are necessary to produce a solution of this difficult control problem."
"This paper compares decomposition and decentralization methods in quadratic optimal control. Two new decomposition algorithms are presented."
"For networks with given topology and fixed one-way link capacities the problem of the dynamic minimization of the average message delay over priority disciplines and routing procedures at each node is studied. It is assumed that a controller is available at each node and that a strategy is to be found for traffic direction on the basis of varying information patterns, such as the sizes of the queues in the different incoming and outgoing links, with or without the Poisson and exponential statistics assumptions."
"Various combinations of 3 of the 12 ECG leads have been recorded simultaneously with the VCG for six subjects. Using a \"least-squares\" error criteria on ten seconds of data, transformations have been derived which allow the generation of the VUG from each of the combinations of ECG leads. Examples of the preliminary results are given, along with the direction of the future work."
  "The optimal control model of the human operator is modilfied to account for imperfect knowledge concerning the system and/or environment. Two simple examples illustrating some of the basic effects are given."
"Phosphorus is one of the critical constituents in the aquatic environment which has been shown to influence algal growth and the associated water quality of lakes and estuaries. An optimal water quality management study for phosphorus treatment in Jamaica Bay, an estuary in New York, is discussed. The results indicate that treatment plant location is extremely important in terms of the impact on the bay and that the costs of treatment can be reduced considerably below what a uniform treatment policy would require."
"Discussion of an investigation in Social psychology shows that system-identification and control analysis are useful tools for analysing dynamic behavioral systems. The theoretical background is provided by the theories of adaptive and learning systems."
"This paper considers the problem of wave-front diagnostics in image compensation adaptive optics. The wavefront distortions are estimated by use of either a Hartmann array or a shearing interferometer. Since the atmospheric turbulence is uncertain, an adaptive estimator is developed which will adapt upon both uncertain turbulence strength and uncertain turbulence bandwidth."
"Extensive use of adaptive controllers has been inhibited by the complexity typically found in the on-line control algorithm. This paper presents a suboptimal adaptive control rule that has a very simple structure. In the class of problems for which it is applicable, the closed-loop system has much reduced sensitivity to an important class of disturbances. The regulator has been tested on a nonlinear model of a aerodynamically controlled reentry vehicle."
"This paper presents a performance adaptive algorithm for the allocation of information gathering (probing) resources and action resources in a time-varying environment. A suboptimal procedure that preserves the essential features of stochastic dynamic programming is developed. The information gathering resources are allocated using the prior probability density function of the subsequent observations in order to evaluate the value of future information. This value is measured in terms of the improvement in the performance index when the action resources are allocated subsequently with more accurate, even though still imperfect, information."
"Based on the implementation and the method of approach, the adaptive observers are herein classified as explicit and implicit observers. Both types are discussed from a convergence point of view, and a geometrical interpretation of the adaptive algorithms is given in order to account for their slow rate of convergence. Finally, an improved adaptive observer is formulated for nth order, linear, single-output, observable and time invariant systems. The proposed scheme uses only input and output measurements, is globally asymptotically stable and has an arbitrarily fast rate of convergence for both the system state and the system parameters. Simulation results are included."
"A simplified form for an adaptive observer is presented which estimates both the states and parameters of an unknown linear time-invariant system. Unlike previous adaptive observers, the new structure generates the controllable form state variables. The adaptive scheme is shown to be globally asymptotically stable and arbitrarily fast."
"One of the most complex and adaptive systems to study is a human involved in a closed loop tracking task. It is observed that when the forcing function of the closed loop system has a time varying velocity and acceleration profile, the human will track the input until it exceeds his physical (visual) limitation. When the input is changing too fast for the human to follow, adaptation (or regression) from tracking occurs. If, however, the input is not changing too rapidly, the human will reacquire the target and continue tracking. A study of this type of adaptability is considered here using the phase plane with a statistical analysis performed over a family of four input forcing functions."
"This paper describes the formulation and validation of a human gunner model suitable for inclusion into a general anti-aircraft artillery attrition algorithm. An optimal control theoretic model with a proportional-integralderivative (P-I-D) controller structure is shown to describe the human gunner's input-output characteristics in the most effective manner. Experimental data from manned AAA simulations is used in formulating and validating the P-ID optimal control gunner model. The gunner model includes target trajectory dependent parameters to account for the adaptive characteristics of the human controller, and allows for lower order internal (to the human) representations of the system dynamics (weapon system and target trajectory) to reflect realistic human psychophysical limitations. The model formulation is in terms of the tracking error and a sufficient number of its higher order derivatives."
"The paper presents a new concept for adaptive control of time-varying systems influenced by environmental variable. Classification aspect of the problem is discussed and emphasized."
"Uncertain elements must be considered in the mathematical model of many dynamical systems. The theory associated with additive noise models is quite advanced, but many control problems are more realistically modeled as containing uncertain and time varying parameters or gains. For multiplicative gains of the white noise type, necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of many of these systems have been derived previously. In this article, we develop conditions for the stability of some continuous-time systems containing multiplicative colored noise."
"New results for the second-order stochastic input-output stability and instability of large classes of continuous time and discrete time interconnected stochastic systems are established. The analysis is acccomplished in terms of lower order subsystems and in terms of system interconnecting structure. When appropriate, frequency domain interpretations are emphasized."
"Analytical procedures for a-priori assessment of key control variables in linear multi-input multi-output dynamic systems are developed and evaluated. These procedures result in explicit, quantitative measures of control influence which allow a control designer to assess the relative importance of all control variables prior to actual feedback control design. In this manner the designer can select for dynamic modulation those controls which have the strongest influence on system dynamic response. The developed methodology is applied to a detailed fifth-order F100 gas turbine engine model. Predicted key control variables are compared with actual key control variables as determined through physical insight into system dynamics and operating experience."
"We describe how the Kalman filter associated with signal and observation processes defined through stochastic evolution equations is stable under the very weak hypotheses of stabilizability, detectability. The results find application in the filtering of signals governed by linear stochastic differential equations with delays; here the hypotheses are directly verifiable."
"This paper formulates the basic state estimation procedures for a class of distributed systems with uncertain parameters. The parameters are not assumed to be random but believed to be arbitrary time functions known to be in a closed and bounded region. The developed estimation scheme provides an assured accuracy and a \"guaranteed\" error estimator which gives an upper bound of the estimation error for any allowed variation of uncertain parameters. The estimation algorithm will be much simpler and easier to implement than any adaptive estimation scheme, since the parameter estimation procedure is not required and is therefore bypassed."
"A discrete analog of the extended Bass algorithm for stabilizing continuous constant systems is discussed and computational experience from using both the continuous and discrete algorithms is presented."
"The application of Lie series method for determination and approximation of asymptotic stability boundary of nonlinear autonomous systems has been reported 1,2,3. However, very little has been published with regard to computing the stability boundary of nonlinear nonautonomous systems. This paper is to discuss an approach for approximating the uniform asymptotic stability boundary of nonautonomous systems by extending the above-mentioned approach."
"A simple condition for global stability of a class of systems with multiple nonlinearities is established. The systems considered are those that can be formed by interconnecting several subsystems having a single non-linearity. Lyapunov functions of the Luré type for the subsystems are constructed from the graphic Popov criterion and the Kalman-Yakubovich Lemma. Using these Lyapunov functions and system parameters it is shown that global stability depends on the definiteness of a matrix. The advantage of this condition is that this matrix can be constructed by an explicit method."
"A new set of performance indices for quadratic performance measures show the way to new design criteria for stochastic linear control systems. The new criteria allow the designer to affect the probability distribution of performance measures without the need for stochastic simulation. Controllers arising in this new format are lineardynamical and exhibit the separation property."
"This note shows that the optimal control of dynamic systems with uncertain parameters has certain limitations. In particular, by means of a simple scalar linear-quadratic optimal control example, it is shown that the infinite horizon solution does not exist if the parameter uncertainty exceeds a certain threshold; we call this the Uncertainty Thereshold Principle. The philosophical and design implications of this result are discussed."
"The use of the microprocessor as a system element requires an understanding of electronics, computer architecture and software. This paper describes a course designed not only to provide this background but also to give the student an appreciation for the strengths and limitations of the new LSI devices. By providing a deeper understanding of the architecture of the various modules and a comparison of the underlying technologies, the course enables the student to integrate the new LSI elements into systems in innovative and economical ways. Some appropriate applications are system control, data acquisition and signal processing."
"This paper describes a new lecture/laboratory course being developed at The University of Michigan to provide students with technical knowledge and experience in incorporating computing elements into engineering designs and control systems. The course, intended for students with minimal computer background (e.g. one higher level language course), seeks to expose students to: the significance of various computer architectures to real time operations; software considerations to real time applications; interrupts and device handling; A/D and D/A conversation techniques; computer to computer communication; and an introducation to digital process control. A laboratory, composed of three LSI-11 microcomputer systems and hardware necessary to connect these to external devices, provides students with hands-on experience in the application of these topics. Laboratory emphasis is on use of computers as elements in control systems."
"The Traffic Simulator is a small-scale model roadway on which vehicles are guided under computer control. The paper discusses a prototype design for the simulator which has evolved through a number of coordinated student design projects."
"The paper presents basic properties of a conversational interactive language L-A-S (Linear Algebra and Systems) used in computer aided design of control systems. The L-A-S language is written in FORTRAN-IV (Dec-10) but its use does not require the Knowledge of standard programming languages. Modular structure of the language permits easy modifications, updating and extentions. The syntax and semantics of the language are simple and straightforward."
"An integral guidance technique is proposed which uses the line-of-sight angle, as well as line-of-sight rate to determine the guidance command. Integral guidance is compared with proportional navigation guidance in a ballistic missile application and is found to reduce trajectory dispersions caused by disturbances."
"Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation is a valuable technique for testing advanced concepts and designs of missile systems. Since actual hardware is used for concept evaluation, model fidelity is assured since \"real world\" effects are built in. This paper presents a description of a generic Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) seeker designed specifically for test purposes and how it can be utilized for control and system evaluation studies."
"The gaming simulation described in this paper is known as COMO III. COMO is a many-on-many, Monte Carlo, critical event simulation for tactical weapon systems. It is particularly useful in system analysis applications because it provides a quantitative measure of system effectiveness."
"This paper describes the practical application of \"Disturbance Accommodating Control Theory\" to a high-performance laser pointing (sighting) device mounted in a helicopter. The disturbances considered include the fundamental and first harmonic rotor-induced vibrations, weapon recoils, and a general class of uncertain pitching motions. It is shown that the disturbance accommodating controller can be designed by systemmatic linear algebraic techniques using state variables. The final controller is completely linear and yields a controller \"transfer function\" having rather unique properties in terms of controller poles and zeroes. The comparative pointing accuracy of the laser device using both a commercially designed classical controller and our \"disturbance accommodating\" controller is studied via analog simulation. By this means, it is shown that the proposed disturbance accommodating controller can (ideally) improve laser pointing accuracy by 2500%, compared to the classical controller."
"An X-system is G : I → Q, Fx : Q → Q (x → X) and H : Q → Y. X-systems generalize linear and bilinear systems over a ring. If I and Y are finite, morphic recurrence is necessary and sufficient for a finite realization. For systems over a ring, if X is finite and if Y is an Artinian, injective module, morphic recurrence is necessary and sufficient for an Artinian realization. For systems with equationally-definable state space, a Hankel matrix has finite rank if and only if it has an Artinian, Noetherian realization."
"A summary of recent results on the algebraic theory of time-varying linear systems on posets is given without proofs. Realization theory is emphasized, and specific calculations closely related to classical ideas are given for systems on the line."
"In this paper we classify linear time invariant control systems according to the symmetery properties they display with respect to output feed-back. Our results show that there are just four possibilities which are easily distinguishable from the transfer functions itself. These results have important implications for feedback stability studies, for the investigation of parametric controllability, and for the construction of special, highly structured, state variable representations."
"Let A'P + PA = -Q be a Lyapunov equation with A being a stability matrix and both A and Q matrices with rational entries. Multiplying A and Q by a suitable positive Integer an equivalent Lyapunov equation A'1P + PA1 = -Q1 is obtained, with A1 and Q1 having integer entries, Let I(x,y) be the ring of polynomials in x and y over the integers I, and E be the set of all square matrices with integer entries. The solution P to this equation is given by: Pu = (emn) = fA 1 (qu(x,y), Q1) P = 1\\u2 × Pu where: qu(x,y) • I(x,y) and u ε I fA 1 : I(x,y) × E → E defined as fA 1 (h(x,y), M) = ∑j,khjk(A'1)j • M•A1 k which is a finite sum. The calculation of u and qu(x,y) requires finding the characterstic polynomial of A1, as well as using the Euclidean Algorithm, computations which lead to polynomial coefficient growth. In order to eliminate the space consuming manipulation of large integers in intermediate steps, modular arithimetic is used to obtain the matrix p iPu= (emnmodpi) and p iu=mu modpi with pi a prime, for a sufficient number of primes. The Chinese Remainder Theorem is then applied to obtain the solution P. The algorithm has been programmed on MACSYMA which is a very suitable computer programming system for all the numerical computations involved. Numerical results as well as extensions to solving the Algebraic Riccati Equation are presented."
"In this paper we describe some results obtained over the past few years in the areas of estimation and control. The point of the research is to find subclasses of systems that possess sufficient structure to allow us to determine optimal solutions or computationally feasible algorithms. In particular, we utilize several results from group theory (both for Lie and finite groups) to obtain our results."
"New sufficient conditions for functions space controllability and hence feedback stabilizability of linear retarded systems are presented. These conditions were obtained by treating the retarded system as a special case of an abstract equation in Hilbert space Rn × L2([-h,0],Rn), (denoted as M2). For systems of type x(t)= A0x(t) + A1x(t-h) + Bu(t), it is shown that most of controllability properties are described by a certain polynomial matrix P(λ), whose columns can be generated by an algorithm computing A0 iB, A1 iB and mixed powers of A0 and A1 multiplied by B. It is shown that the M2- approximate controllability of the system is guaranteed by certain triangularity properties of P(λ). By using the Luenberger canonical form, it is shown that the system is M2-approximately controllable if the palr (A1,B) is controllable and if each of the spaces spanned by columns of [B,A1B, ..., A1 jB], j=0...n-1, is invariant under transformation A0. Other conditions of this type are also given. Since the M2-approximate controllability implies controllability of all the eigenmodes of the system, the feedback stabilizability with an arbitrary exponential decay rate is guaranteed under hypotheses leading to M2-approximate controllability. Some examples are given."
"An iterative procedure is developed for estimating the domain of attraction of a class of nonlinear systems. The procedure uses the Volterra series representation for the solution and is suitable for automatic computations. The algorithm is applied to the transient stability problem in electrical power systems and a favorable comparison with previous criteria is obtained."
"This study concerns control laws which are optimal in the sense of minimizing a class of performance indices which penalize peak trajectory error. For the time-invariant case with infinite control horizon, the optimal control is shown to exist, be unique, and be a time-invariant feed-back map requiring current state and worst-error-to-date. This law is asymptotically stable if and only if the (linear) model has no Jω axis poles. A linear terminal control law is explicitly calculated, and necessary and sufficient conditons which characterize all optimal solutions presented."
"The uniform asymptotic stability of two types of nonautonomous linear systems is characterized in terms of the \"richness\" of the system elements. The stability of these equations aries in connection with several adaptive schemes for the idenfication of the parameters of a plant with input and output measurable."
"This paper contains an explicit parametrization of a subclass of linear constant gain feedback maps that will not destabilize an originally open-loop stable system. These results can then be used to obtain several new structural stability results for multi-input linear-quadratic feedback optimal designs."
"In this paper characterizations of stabilizability and detectability are obtained directly in terms of the system parameters, for evolution systems defined on Banach spaces (state, input and output). The results are applicable to a wide class of physical systems such as time delay systems, partial differential systems etc. The general results are applied to the above mentioned classes of systems to rederive, in a simple way, conditions obtained by other methods."
"New criteria as a generalization of the resultant of two polynomials are given for relative primeness of polynomial matrices together with system theoretic interpretations and unification of the existing and new criteria."
"The notion of output detectability of a system is introduced which is concerned about the problem of being able to detect the effect of disturbances on the output of a system using different measurable outputs. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for a linear time-invariant system to be output-detectable. Properties of the output-detectability condition are then obtained; in particular, it is shown that a system is \"almost always\" output-detectable, if the number of measurable outputs is not less than the number of disturbances; if the number of measurable outputs is less than the number of disturbances, then a system is \"almost never\" output detectable. Application of these results is then made to find necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist to a general servomechanism problem, in which the measured outputs of the system are, in general, different from the outputs to be regulated. Explicit controllers which solve this general servomechanism problem are obtained. It is then shown that there is \"almost always\" a solution to this general servomechanism problem if and only if the number of control inputs is not less than the number of outputs to be regulated and the number of measured outputs is not less than the number of disturbances. A frequency-domain interpretation of output-detectability and the solvability of the general servomechanism problem is then made and it is shown, in particular, that for stable, minimum phase systems which have sufficient inputs and measurable outputs, there always exists a solution to the servomechanism problem."
"Consider the finite subset {(xi, yi)} of input-output pairs. A common design objective is to specify a system, S, such that yi = Sxi holds on the set in question. Moreover, S should also be well behaved on a larger input space. In a recent study [1], the author solved a synthesis problem of the above type. In that study the input and output spaces are taken to be arbitrary Hilbert Resolution spaces. At present we focus attention also on the Hilbert space L2(v). It is shown that the operator theoretic solution of [1] can be realized by a differential equation set of the form. z(t) = A(t)z(t) + b(t)x(t) y(t) = c(t)z(t), t ε v where {A,b,c} are explicitly specified from the input-output data."
"Several deterministic identification problems, with partial realization being a special case, are unified in the framework of the mathematical problem \"generalized dynamic covers\". An algorithm to find such a minimal dynamic cover as well as a uniqueness criterion is given, which yields several identifiability results. This problem also includes the \"observer\" and the \"exact model matching\" problems, as well as the problem of finding \"minimal inverses for linear systems with arbitrary initial states\"."
"This paper exploits the concept of a predictor space in the minimal realization problem for systems generating an analytic impulse response matrix. The predictor space constructed, by stochastic input and output processes forms the state space for the stochastic system representation, where a system is represented by the basis of the predictor space and the innovation process of input. The minimal realization problem is then solved for a given analytic impulse response matrix by defining a stochastic system driven by white noise whose input-output covariance equals the given impulse response matrix. It is shown that the coefficient matrices of the stochastic system representation constitute a solution to the minimal realization problem for the deterministic system with given impulse response matrix. The paper provides a unifying overview to many aspects of the realization problem and its algorithms."
"In the design of single input-single output feedback systems for prescribed insensitivity to parameter-variation, a simple translation of time-domain specifications into the frequency-domain allows an analytical solution to be obtained by Wiener-Hopf spectral factorization."
"Minimax state estimation for an uncertain system is discussed. The conservative performance of the standard minimax estimator in the absence of an intelligent adversary is reduced by a combined detector-estimator structure and an incremental mean-squared error performance criterion. The optimal structure is defined for a wide class of linear and nonlinear systems whose uncertain parameters are elements of some known compact space. Since the complete specification of the optimal estimator detector is problem dependent, a computational procedure is outlined. In an example, the resulting combined detectorestimator is shown to increase the estimation accuracy in the incremental minimax sense by a factor of two over the standard minimax estimator."
"An algorithm is described which estimates the state of a linear system from quantized measurements of the output of that system. The estimator is an unbiased minimum variance estimator which is constrained to be recursive. The form of the estimator is linear in terms of the innovation, although the gain does depend on past measurements. The basic estimator is a time-varying filter; a stationary estimator, whose gain is computed prior to the processing of any measurements, is also presented. The performance of this quantized data filter is compared with the performances of both a Kalman filter operating on the linear output and a Kalman filter which processes quantized data. The quantized data filter results in significant performance improvements when a coarse quantization characteristic with few levels is used."
 "There is evidence that the algorithms for estimating traffic flows from sensor data need to be improved before computer controlled traffic responsive urban traffic control systems can reach their full potential effectiveness. A large part of the problem appears to be that the data from traffic sensors is, in the statistical jargon, a marked point process. It is only very recently that the theoretical techniques for estimation based on point process data have reached the sophistication needed for traffic problems. In this paper, these techtechniques are used to derive several recursive algorithms for filtering traffic sensor data and predicting urban traffic flows. These filters and predictors are then evaluated and compared using simulated traffic data."

"This paper describes a technique for modeling the time correlations of the smoothing error process, i.e., the stochastic process consisting of a linear system driven by gaussian noise. The reduced order model is developed via shaping filter design. This technique can be used to separate a large-scale linear smoothing problem into stages, each of which consists of a subsystem smoothing problem."
"This paper presents a method for the realization of non-linear estimators based on spline interpolation. The difference of a monospline and its interpolating spline forms a monospline and then a quadrature formula is induced. When the knots of the monospline at which the conditional density is discretized are allowed to vary, a class of optimal quadrature formulas is obtained. To find the monospline with optimal knots a set of non-linear algebraic equations must be solved. If the symmetry property of the monospline is applied, the order of the non-linear equations can be reduced by about one-half. An iteration scheme of Newton type is introduced to solve the monospline. The quadrature formula associated with this monospline has the so-called positivity property which is essential in the practical implementation of non-linear recursive estimators."
"This paper considers the application of error analysis algorithms for the linear quadratic gaussian problem to the design of digital control systems for a simple model of a helicopter in hover. Particularly, we investigate the influence on the performance of modelling errors in the stability derivatives and correlation time of the wind gust model. The algorithms presented enable the determination of performance loss in the case of reduced order models. As an example of this possibility we will consider the case when colored system noise is misindentified as a gaussian white noise. The simulated results, for a helicopter in hover, given in the paper indicate that the extra effort expended in parameter identification may not be justified as the optimal trajectory and final performance is practically insensitive to errors in most of the model parameters."

    "CATV amplifiers can convert amplitude cross-modulation into phase cross-modulation. It has been generally assumed that this is desirable. A theory is developed and checked experimentally that shows that the fm deviations caused by the phase shifts are visible in television receivers. If the phase shift exhibits a rise time of about 100 ns or less, phase cross-modulation and amplitude cross-modulation are equally visible if the sidebands of the two modulation processes are equal for a 15 kHz squarewave. The visibility of the phase cross-modulation is rise-time dependent, showing a 12 dB decrease in visibility as the rise time is lengthened to about 300 ns."
"In a cable-powered distribution network, the regulated power supplies of the various active components present a nonlinear load to the power voltage. A unit with a switching voltage regulator is approximately a constant-power load, whose current drain drops with increasing voltage. A series-resistance controlled regulator is approximately a constant-current load, but taps on the primary of the transformer change the characteristic to a staircase of constant-current segments."
 "For a frequency-modulation relay link carrying television, a simple general form is suggested for the relationship between baseband signal-to-noise ratio and the ratio of carrier power to noise power density applied to the receiver discriminator. The bandlimiting, emphasis, and weighting functions prescribed by various standards are characterized by effective noise bandwidths with respect to triangular noise."
"A technique of amplifier linearization through the use of complementary pre or post distortion correction circuits is investigated. Using the Volterra series representation, distortion cancellation constraints imposed on the correction circuit are derived. A simple distortion correction circuit consisting of a diode, a resistor, and a capacitor (inductor) is then devised to meet the above constraints for cancellation of the amplifier's third order distortion products."
"This paper discusses the cascade behaviour of AGC/ASC amplifiers and examines some aspects of system performance and reliability. Potential limitations to the cascading of such amplifiers, heretofore not widely known, are delineated. It is shown that amplification of transients and transfer modulation occur in AGC/ASC amplifier cascades and that extemely large amplitude transients are generated under certain conditions."
"The performance of CATV trunk amplifiers versus spacing is examined for spacings of 8 to 48 dB. The tradeoffs of bandwidth, channel loading and performance are discussed as they apply to AM and FM cable links. General amplifier considerations are discussed as they apply to obtaining maximum trunk amplifier performance. The advantages and limitations of FM cable links are discussed including signal to noise ratio improvement, bandwidth, and threshold effects. The properties of FM that influence amplifier spacing are examined and an upper bound for spacing is discussed as it applies to present and future FM links."

  "Remote sensing provides an unmatched data source for obtaining information about earth resources. This paper briefly describes the development of remote sensing, then discusses the physical and technological basis for obtaining earth resources information from airborne and spaceborne sensors. It points out that information may be derived from analyzing the spectral, spatial, and temporal variations of energy emanating from the earth's surface. The two types of analysis, image-oriented and numerical-oriented, are discussed with emphasis on the latter and machine-processing of data. Finally, applications of remote sensing technology are discussed."
"This paper reviews some recent topics in pattern recognition applied to remote sensing problems. In decision-theoretic pattern recognition, four topics are presented: per-field classifications, cluster analysis and sequential partitioning procedure, feature selection, and estimation of misclassification. The syntactic approach to pattern recognition is then introduced and its application to remote sensing problems illustrated. Problems for further research are discussed."
"A method of classification of digitized multispectral image data is described. It is designed to exploit a particular type of dependence between adjacent states of nature that is characteristic of the data. The advantages of this, as opposed to the conventional \"per point\" approach, are greater accuracy and efficiency, and the results are in a more desirable form for most purposes. Experimental results from both aircraft and satellite data are included."
"The quadratic form can be expressed as a monotonically increasing sum of squares when the inverse covariance matrix is represented in canonical form. This formulation has the advantage that, in testing a particular class hypothesis, computations can be discontinued when the partial sum exceeds the smallest value obtained for other classes already tested. A method for channel selection is presented which arranges the original input measurements in that order which minimizes the expected number of computations. The classification algorithm was tested on data from LARS Flight Line Cl and found to reduce the sum-of-products operations by a factor of 6.7 compared to the conventional approach. In effect, the accuracy of a twelve-channel classification was achieved using only that CPU time required for a conventional four-channel classification."
"A new signature extension method for use with LANDSAT data has been developed. The MASC (Multiplicative and Additive Signature Correction) algorithm uses an unsupervised clustering routine to gain relative information from two data sets. This information is then used to map the signatures derived from one data set onto the other data set. The MASC algorithm can be totally automated, thus making it suitable for use in large area crop inventories. This signature extension method has been tested on agricultural LANDSAT data. The results of field center pixel classification using MASC-extended signatures have been compared with classification results using untransformed signatures. In all three data set pairs the MASC algorithm yielded very good results."
"Three algorithms for line detection, the linear detector, the nonlinear detector, and the semilinear detector are examined. Experiments are conducted on detecting linear features in terrain on LANDSAT-1 images, and on detecting suburban roads on Skylab images."
"When one image (the sigal) is to be registered with a second image (the signal plus noise) of the same scene, one would like to know the accuracy possible for this registration. This paper derives an estimate of the variance of the registration error that can be expected via two approaches. The solution in each instance is found to be a function of the effective bandwidth of the signal and the noise, and the signal-to-noise ratio. Application of these results to LANDSAT-1 data indicates that for most cases registration variances will be significantly less than the diameter of one picture element."
"Eight channel Skylab multispectral scanner data obtained in January 1974 were used in a level two land-use analysis of Allen County, Indiana. The data set which includes one visible channel, four near infrared channels, two middle infrared channels, and one far infrared channel was from the X-5 detector array of the S-192 experiment in the Earth Resources Experiment Package on board the Skylab space station. The results indicate that a good quality far infrared (thermal) channel is very valuable for land use mapping during the winter months."
"Forest inventory data were interpreted from color IR photography, transferred to base maps, and digitized for machine processing. The data were registered to geodetic coordinates providing the capability to perform several types of dimensional analysis. Processing data by this technique allowed: (1) Spatial or single variable analysis, (2) overlay or composite analysis (in combination with other variables), and (3) temporal analysis. Information derived from this procedure was input for a land management decision system used to construct a forest management plan for 25,000 acres in east Tennessee."
"This study was designed to find the locations in Big Quill Lake, Saskatchewan, where the transfer of surficial and aquifer ground-water occurs in the lake bed. Using the findings of a geological survey done between 1966 and 1969, and combining the results of the remote sensing techniques of LANDSAT-1 airborne radio phase detection (EPHASE) and infrared line-scanning, it proved possible to locate nine areas at which inflow of groundwater is assumed to take place. Together these nine locations comprise an area of four square kilometers (1.5 mi2) in a lake that covers 250 square kilometers (100 mi2). In addition it was possible to separate these nine groundwater locations from such dynamic events as spiral currents (a tenth anomaly zone) and peninsula building bottom currents."
"LANDSAT-1 Bulk MSS Computer Compatible Tapes (CCT's) maintain the intrinsic radiometric and spatial qualities of the MSS (NASA, 1972) and as such are potentially superior to MSS 70 mm photographic products in the study of both regional and small scale geological trends. A convenient method of realizing this potential is via a digital-to-analog conversion of processed CCT data and CRT display to produce photographic hardcopy. This paper describes a flexible method of producing such displays that can be color composited with ground-based mapping data transformed to be compatible with the MSS geometric projection. Mapping accuracy of image detail to corresponding ground features was of the order of 50 to 160 meters rms over individual CCT areas. Two geological applications of CCT imagery are described and in each case the improved geological definition of CCT displays over that obtainable from NASA 70 mm transparencies is illustrated."

"The radar response to soil moisture content was experimentally determined for each of three bare fields with considerably different surface roughnesses at eight frequencies in the 2-8 GHz band for HH and VV polarizations. Analysis of the data indicates that the effect of roughness on the radar backscattering coefficient can be minimized by proper choice of the radar parameters. If, in addition, sensitivity to soil moisture content and system design constraints are considered, the following radar parameters are recommended for an operational soil moisture mapper: Radar Signal Frequency: 4 GHz Angle of Incidence Range: 7°-15° from nadir Signal Polarization: HH or VV. The corresponding sensitivity is about 0.25 dB/.01 g/cm3."
"Correlations have been calculated between active and passive microwave responses received by the S-193 radiometer-scatterometer on Skylab. Over both land and sea the correlations between polarizations are high, but the correlation between radiometer and scatterometer response at 30° incidence is negligible. This suggests that multipolarization instruments with this crude resolution (greater than 10 km in all cases) are redundant, but a combination of radiometer and scatterometer is useful. Correlations among the responses at different angles suggest that the five angles used in Skylab are more than would be useful between 0° and 48° in future instruments, but that instruments with three angles of measurement would be useful. In small areas, conclusions based on these large-data-set averages may need to be modified."
"SKYLAB II S193 Scatterometer data for the passes of June 5, 1973, over the Gulf of Mexico and June 6, 1973, over Pacific Hurricane AVA were analyzed. These two passes were chosen since it was possible to correlate the scattering data with simultaneous measurements of the local ocean wind conditions. The S193 scatterometer measured the radar cross section of the ocean at 13.9 GHz (Ku-band) as a function of incidence angle. The S193 data of June 5, 1973, when a practically uniform wind field was present, show reasonable agreement with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) empirical and theoretical models. The data of June 6, 1973, are more complex, due to rapid variations in wind speeds and directions around Hurricane AVA. The NRL empirical model was interpolated to account for variation in wind heading relative to the S193 antenna pointing direction; a reasonable comparison could then be made with the corresponding S193 data of June 6, 1973."
"A method of measuring temperatures of selected ground cover types using remotely sensed multispectral scanner data and a layered classification approach is described. A brief review of radiation theory is presented to show that for the wavelength bands and temperature ranges involved in remote sensing applications, a linear calibration function can be satisfactorily utilized. Finally, an example of the application of the layered classifier for temperature mapping of water is shown."
"A correlation technique is described, which allows a sensible reduction of the noise in power spectrum measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field by means of the search coil magnetometer. Two sensors are required that detect the same signal. If the noises of the two amplifying channels are uncorrelated, the timeaverage of the product of the two channel outputs depends on the power of the magnetic field signal, but is not affected by the noises of the two channels. The application of the proposed technique to space-borne instrumentation leads to a relevant reduction in weight and bulk because of the lower sensitivity required from the sensor. A search coil magnetometer has been developed that is based on the use of sensors of small length (9.5 cm) and that exhibits an equivalent input noise smaller than 10-4/ƒ2 expressed in γ2/Hz as magnetic noise power spectrum."
"Measurements of surface magnetic fields may be used to locate a sub-surface oscillating magnetic dipole. However, lateral changes in ground electrical conductivity can affect the location accuracy. Use is made of finite difference solutions to assess the location error. Results show that for reasonable lateral changes in conductivity serious errors can result. Locations based on magnetic tilt angle measurements are more accurate than locations found from the null of the horizontal component."

 "Recent exploration of the planets has been highlighted by the development of visual imaging systems carried on board the spacecraft. This paper describes the evolution of planetary camera systems from the earliest reconnaissance flight to Mars in 1965 (Mariner 4) through the planned mission to Jupiter and Saturn in 1977. Advances in telecommunication performance, mission planning and operations, and digital processing of images are also discussed. Science objectives and changes in the imaging systems required to meet these objectives are discussed for the Mariner Mars 1971 (Mariner 9), Mariner Venus-Mercury (Mariner 10), Viking 1975 (Mars Orbiter), and Mariner Jupiter-Saturn 1977 missions. The last section of the paper describes future plans for imaging experiments based on cameras using solid-state sensors, particularly charge-coupled devices."
"Multispectral mapping is an effective method for determining the spatial extent of geologic units on a planetary surface and of absorption and scattering properties in planetary atmospheres. Groundbased telescopic studies of the moon have been carried out for more than 60 years, but spacecraft missions have seldom included multispectral-mapping experiments. Development in two-dimensional detector technology and image-processing techniques are stimulating activity in this field. Increased understanding of the optical properties of planetary-surface materials is making multispectral maps more meaningful."
"Two instruments, the gamma-ray spectrometer and the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, are uniquely suited to the chemical mapping of planetary surfaces from orbit. Through their detection of characteristic line spectra they measure the concentrations of a suite of elements in each area overflown. Multielement chemical maps derived from these remote measurements are used in the construction of evolutionary models of planetary bodies and of the solar system as a whole. The NaI(T1) gamma-ray spectrometer and a gas proportional X-ray spectrometer were flown over 20 percent of the lunar surface during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions. These instruments measured chemical differences across the boundaries of known lunar provinces and revealed several new features of lunar-surface composition. Advanced spectrometers which are under development for future missions are able to educe much more information in a given time span than the Apollo instruments. They may be used in possible future missions such as Lunar Polar Orbiter, a Mars orbiter, a Mercury orbiter, outer planet satellite missions, rendezvous with asteroids and cometary nuclei, and surface-penetrating planetary probes."
"The major scientific achievements associated with the measurement of magnetic fields in space over the past decade and a half are reviewed. Aspects of space technology relevant to magnetic-field observations are discussed, including the different types of magnetometers used and how they operate, problems arising from spacecraft-generated magnetic fields and the appropriate countermeasures that have been developed and on-board processing of magnetometer data. The scientific discussion is restricted to only the major achievements; however, all the major topics are covered, specifically: the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field, the Earth's magnetic field in space, the interaction of the solar wind with the planets, planetary magnetic fields, and the permanent magnetic fields of the Moon. A brief description is also included of future missions now scheduled for launch which should contribute significantly to the understanding of extraterrestrial magnetic fields. A fairly complete bibliography is included which lists original contributions as well as more recent publications and review articles."
"Doppler radio tracking of deep space probes near extra-terrestrial bodies has provided information on the internal mass distribution for Jupiter, Mars, the Moon, Venus, and Mercury. The more detailed results have been obtained for Mars and the Moon where orbiting spacecraft (Mariner 9 and Apollo) have returned a vast amount of gravity data The instrumentation to acquire the data consists of a spacecraft transponder and an Earth-based ultrastable frequency oscillator, along with appropriate transmitters, receivers, and antennas. The necessary data reduction to extract the gravity parameters from the Doppler signal variations requires a very complex computer program. The major achievements have been the detailed results for Mars and the Moon where global gravity fields reveal high correlation with topography. Present investigations on isostatic conditions are constraining viscosity estimates, and it appears that viscosity at various eras may be determined. Apollo data at very low altitudes (15-20 km) have provided gravity profiles for frontside mascons, craters, and mountain chains. The determinations of the first three even zonal spherical harmonic coefficients for Jupiter places constraints on the interior as well as the outer envelope. A proposed cross section of Jupiter is shown, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium in different states. Some comments are made on Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter's Galilean satellites."
"The assemblage of volatiles degassed from each planetary object simultaneously reflects the preaccretion history of the solid solar-system material which accreted to produce that object and the internal differentiation history of the object. The key questions are: 1) What are the differences in bulk composition among planetary objects and how did they arise? and 2) How have volatiles within each object been redistributed among its interior, its surface, and its atmosphere?-a) What is the total volatile inventory which was degassed to each surface? b) When did supply occur and what were the energy sources? and c) What was the geochemical fate of each constituent? In comparative studies of planetary-surface and atmospheric volatiles, one of the hardest problems is disentangling differences among planetary-surface volatile inventories which are due to initial differences in bulk composition among objects from those due to differences in subsequent internal differentiation and atmospheric history. In the area of internal differentiation and degassing, the greatest puzzles involve understanding apparent differentiation of surprisingly small objects and surprisingly early differentiation of both large and small objects. The answers to these questions are most efficiently obtained by a balanced program of space exploration which includes strong missionsupporting programs of Earth-based observations, theoretical studies, and laboratory experiments. The study of \"planetary atmospheres\" cannot be undertaken in isolation from studies of other important sinks for degassed volatiles."
"The complex dielectric constant of sea water is a function of salinity at 21-cm wavelength, and sea-water salinity can be determined by a measurement of radiometric temperature at 21 cm along with a measurement of thermodynamic temperature. Three aircraft and two helicopter experiments using two different 21-cm radiometers were conducted under different salinity and temperature conditions. Ground-truth measurements were used to calibrate the data in each experiment. RMS deviations of between 2 and 3%0 were found between remote and ground-truth boat measurements. Part of this deviation is attributed to position mislocation between the aircraft and boats. It is inferred from these experiments that accuracies of 1 to 2%o are possible with a single surface calibration point necessary only every two hours if the following conditions are met-water temperatures about 20°C, salinities above 10%0, level aircraft flight, and extreme care near land masses."

 "The electrical conductivity (σ) of cylindrical cores of 25.4-mm diameter and length Pictured Cliffs sandstone (permeability range, 7 × 10-4 × 10-1 millidarcy (md); porosity range, 3.8-4.9 percent) was measured at a frequency of 1 kHz under ambient conditions after saturation in tap water. Kinetics of rock-water interaction and the effect of Soxhlet extraction on the σ of the rock were also investigated. Formation factors (F) and the σ display time-dependent behavior up to 4500 h. Smooth asymmetrical conductivity maxima occur for all samples at times which increase with increasing porosity. The observed timedependence of F in Archie's Law (F = ϕ-n, ϕ = porosity, n = a parameter) is influenced by the kinetics of ion transport between the Pictured Cliffs sandstone and the aqueous pore fluid. Soxhlet extraction lowers F, but does not significantly change its time dependence."
"Few subsurface geometric configurations have been studied in electromagnetic-induction prospecting. In particular, geophysicists have usually considered only models of the earth which are flat and which consist of parallel regions of contrasting electrical conductivity. In order to evaluate the electric and magnetic field over subsurface geologic structure, the earth is modeled by two conductive layers which are joined at an irregular interface. Maxwell's equations are then applied to obtain a set of integral equations for the electromagnetic field which are solved by using a perturbation technique. Horizontal electric field and apparent resistivity master curves are calculated for the case of H-polarization. These curves demonstrate that for a given subsurface structure and resistivity contrast, the horizontal electric-field anomaly is greater when the first layer is more conductive than the second layer than when the first layer is more resistive than the second layer. When the wavelength in the more conductive layer of the electromagnetic field is less than the width of a resistant anticlinal ridge, the horizontal electric field decreases over the ridge. On the other hand, when the wavelength is much greater than the width of a resistant ridge, the horizontal electric field increases over that ridge. Given the resistivity contrast and electric-field anomaly, the depth to the crest of a buried anticlinal ridge may be ascertained. Similarly, overburden thickness determinations accurate to within 10 percent can be made from electric-field anomalies provided that the width of the subsurface structure is small relative to the depth of the structure."
"Coefficients are given for computation of the vertical component of magnetic field at the surface of a layered earth due to a long electric current also on the surface. A computed curve for a homogeneous earth is compared to a previous result by Price [5]."
"A computer code to plot the response of a dipole-dipole resistivity array over a many-layered earth is described."
"A conducting cavity in an underground coal burn was remotely probed from the surface with a wide-band electromagnetic induction system. The cavity, located near Hanna, WY, was produced by underground gasification of a 30-ft-thick subbituminous-coal seam ranging in depth from 300 to 400 ft. The cavity filled with saline ground water after the burn. The wide-band loop-loop system employed pseudonoise and cross-correlation techniques to produce a transient-time response in the field. Additional computer processing produced normalized 3-dimensional signature maps in both the time and frequency domains. These horizontal profiling maps, corresponding to a 100-Hz-50-kHz passband, demonstrate that a significant anomaly is produced by the cavity as the system is moved across the site. Time-domain maps show nearly a 7-1 change in relative peak-to-peak values, whereas the frequency-domain magnitude response changes as much as 36-1. Results were corroborated using another single-frequency system. These anomalies demonstrate the feasibility of employing induction systems to remotely characterize underground coal-burn cavities filled with conducting fluid."
"An overview of the tilt of an electromagnetic surface wave propagating along the surface of the earth is given. High-frequency wave-tilt measurements can have important applications in low conductivity regions such as desert and permafrost areas. A specific application includes determining the depth of permafrost. Past applications of wave-tilt measurements were primarily with lower frequencies in regions with high ground conductivities. Thus low frequencies (<1 MHz) were needed to probe to significant depths. Wave-tilt calculations show that for low surface conductivities, it may be feasible to probe to significant depths using high frequencies (>1 MHz). This enables resolution of thicknesses of layers, a result that has not been possible at low frequencies in the higher conductivity media. It is noted that differences in wave tilt occur for vertically and horizontally polarized surface waves. These wave-tilt differences are useful because they indicate profile characteristics that are sensitive in different ways to the two polarizations."
"Electromagnetic soundings were made using two techniques in an area around the summit of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. The target for the soundings was a conductive zone at a depth of about one kilometer, associated with geothermal heating. In one sounding method, an electromagnetic field was generated by passing current steps through a grounded-wire transmitter, while in the other, an electromagnetic field was generated by passing current steps through an ungrounded loop. The field was detected at a receiving site by measuring the vertical component of magnetic induction using an ungrounded loop. Both methods accurately reflected the presence of conductive rocks at depth. However, the use of a grounded-wire source had a strong advantage in that the field decayed with distance more slowly than that from the loop source, and a larger area could be surveyed using a single grounded-wire source."
"The electrical structure of the earth can be studied effectively to depths of 3-5 km using a time-domain electromagnetic sounding method. In the method, an electromagnetic field is generated by passing a current step with an amplitude of several hundred amperes through a grounded wire 1-2 km in length. Then, the magnetic induction is detected and recorded at distances of 10-12 km. Experience with several thousand such soundings has shown them to provide accurate information on the electrical structure of the subsurface."
"Three-dimensional response maps are displayed and interpreted in both time and frequency domains. The wide-bandwidth induction system utilizes pseudonoise and cross-correlation techniques to characterize subsurface conducting bodies. In contrast to more typical single-frequency systems, both horizontal-profiling and depth-sounding information are present in these maps. Consequently, interpretation of model surveys is prerequisite to interpretation of field data. Experimental model surveys were performed in the laboratory over a conducting dike and a conducting semi-infinite horizontal sheet. The real part, imaginary part, magnitude, and phase of normalized frequency responses are plotted versus frequency and system location. Raw time signatures are converted to frequency response on 0-50 kHz with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and normalized to the response without a conductor present. Normalized transient-time responses (impulse responses) of the conductors are obtained by the inverse DFT and compared with the raw time signatures. Windowing effects in both domains are discussed. The raw-time-signature peak value is quite sensitive to conducting anomalies and can be used to directly delineate conductors in the field. However, more detailed information about size and depth must be obtained by additional signal processing."

"Prebreakdown currents in a coaxial cylindrical geometry in nitrogen have been measured with and without a crossed magnetic field. The range of parameters used in the investigation are 2.6 ≦ p ≦ 14.5 torr, 50 ≦ (E/p) ≦ 420 V cm-1 torr-1, and 43.0 ≦ H/p ≦ 1185 Oe torr-1 (p is the pressure, E is the electric field, and H is the magnetic field). The initial photoelectric current is obtained by allowing photons produced in an auxiliary glow discharge to strike the cathode. Ions and electrons produced in the auxiliary discharge are prevented from reaching the main gap by suitable shielding. By modifying the Rice equation for back diffusion, the measured ionization current multiplication without a crossed magnetic field is compared with the multiplication predicted by the Townsend growth equation for nonuniform electric fields. It is observed that over the range of 50 ≦ (E/P)max ≦ 250 [(E/P)max is the value of E/p at the central electrode of the coaxial system] measured and calculated multiplication of current agree with each other. With a crossed magnetic field the prebreakdown currents have been measured and compared with the theoretically calculated currents using the equivalent pressure concept. Agreement between the calculated and measured currents is not satisfactory, and this has been attributed more to the uncertainty in the collision frequency data available than nonuniformity of the electric field. Sparking potentials have been measured with and without a crossed magnetic field."
"In order to predict the usefulness of ultrasonic techniques for detecting and locating transformer coronas or partial discharges, it is necessary to determine the relationship between electrical and ultrasonic values of different coronas within an unobstructed oil environment. Experiments are reported in which typical corona sources, ranging in value from ~5-~105 pC, were energized within an oil-filled transparent tank and the ultrasonic emissions recorded via a transducer on the tank outer wall. Several distinct modes, changing with magnitude, of the oil discharges were observed, and the relationship between charge measurements Q and ultrasonic values P were found to vary from P ∝ Q1/2 to P ∝ Q."
"It is shown that microdischarges can be caused to occur between vacuum insulated electrodes by exposing the electrode surfaces to oil contamination or to the condensation of electronegative gases (H2O, CO2). The presence of the condensed H2O layers at low electrode temperatures lowers the microdischarge onset by a factor of 3 and the implication of this for microdischarge theory and vacuum cable development are discussed. A theory is presented which enables the onset of breakdown in the gas released by the microdischarge to be calculated."
"The electrical conduction properties of polyethylene filled with 3-percent carbon have been investigated. Detailed step response measurements have been performed as a function of temperature in a range of electric fields below 104 V/cm where conduction is essentially ohmic. Using a Fourier transform technique a frequency-dependent loss factor was calculated from the resorption current data. Thermaliy activated relaxation-type peaks are found at very low frequencies and interpreted tentatively as arising from interfacial polarizations at the various crystalline-amorphous interfaces. Results of measurements of the residual dc conductivity are also discussed."
"We present an equation for the characteristic time τ, through which we can calculate the formative time lag of breakdown tf more accurately than previously obtained. This equation takes into consideration both the effect of the first Townsend ionization coefficient α and the second Townsend ionization coefficient due to positiveion bombardment γi. Calculations of the characteristic time τ were carried out for oxygen, using the presented equation, at uniform field and over wide ranges of the breakdown parameters. The results obtained are presented together with a brief study. It was found that the characteristic time is independent of the electrode separation d, with an error much less than 1 percent, at constant gas pressure p and electricfield strength E, over certain ranges of d. Also it was found that the characteristic time is inversely proportional to the gas pressure raised to a constant power over a wide range of pressure, at constant percentage overvoltage and constant product of gas pressure and electrode separation. In addition, the coefficients A and B of the well-known equation of the first Townsend ionization coefficient α,α=Ap exp = (-Bp/E), are obtained."
"An experimental investigation of the effect of chromium oxide coatings upon the surface flashover of high-density alumina in vacuum is reported. It is shown that such coatings improve the withstand voltage for dc, 60-Hz, and impulse voltages by significant amounts. The coatings are simply applied, effective, and durable. It is postulated that the improvement in insulation is due to the elimination of positive surface charging by the use of a coating with a secondary-electron emission coefficient less than unity for all incident electron energies."

"The measurement of dielectric strengths is generally beset with numerous difficulties, and results depend to a large extent upon experimental conditions and sample geometry. The development of so-called cylindrical samples, in which spherical electrodes are almost completely embedded in the dielectric to be measured, and observation of stringent cleanliness, have resulted in distributions of the measured breakdown field strengths which can no longer be described by simple distribution functions. The results can, however, be consistently interpreted with multiplicatively mixed distribution, functions consisting of two Weibuli distributions, one of which reprelents the so-called technological breakdown due to macroscopic imperfections, and the second of which represents the material or intrinsic breakdown. On the basis of this differentiation, the influence of various parameters on the electrical breakdown behavior of polyethylene is discussed."
"Fringing fields can lead to pronounced optical effects when a Kerr cell containing a dielectric liquid is observed between crossed polarizers. Such effects must be considered when using Kerr cells for accurate measurement of either Kerr coefficients or pulsed high voltages. Calculations of both the fringing fields and their resultant optical effects are made assuming a Rogowski contour for the electrodes. The results agree well with experimental observation. Corrections are obtained for the effective length l' of the electrodes for arbitrary positioning of a light ray parallel to the electrode edges. The literature value of l' = l(1 + t/lπ) is recovered for a ray centered between the electrodes, where I is the electrode length and t the electrode separation. These results are shown to hold when the electrode length and width (w) obey I > w ⩾ 2t and when the container walls of the cell are more than 2t from the electrode ends and sides."
"The temporal variations of conduction currents were closely observed for point-to-sphere and sphere-to-sphere gaps, in transformer oil and in n-hexane, subjected to high direct voltages. Current bursts of both long and short durations could be distinguished from the random fluctuation of the quasi-steady current component. Long-duration bursts were similar to some previous observations and could be related to impurity particle activity in the liquid. Many short-duration bursts, however, had the polarity opposite to that of the quasi-steady current component. Explanations are proposed."
"The dc sparking potential of nitrous oxide is measured between concentric coaxial cylindrical electrodes over the gas pressure range 2 X 1O-2-81O torr for both positive and negative voltage polarities of the inner electrode. An intersection in the sparking potential and pressure curves is observed at high pressures when the sparking potential for the negative inner electrode changes from being lower to higher than the corresponding positive breakdown at a fixed gas pressure. The similarity law is found to hold in this gas only for a limited range of gas pressures. The sparking potential values are also calculated by means of an empirical general discharge concept and compared with the measured values. Reasonable agreement is obtained."
"The interpretation of the limiting flashover voltages (LFOV) observed on SiO2 insulator plates contaminated by nine common salts (NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, MgCl2, Mg(NO3)2, MgSO4, CaCI2, Ca(NO3)2 and CaSO4) has been carried out in terms of the concepts of solid-state electrochemistry. On the basis of the hypothesis that the salt under the active electrode is dry during flashover, it has been shown that the LFOV values for various salts are roughly related to their heats of formation per equivalent and bandgap values. The alternative hypothesis that the salt under the active electrode is wet has also been examined and the possibility of interpreting the salt effects on LFOV values in the context of this hypothesis has been explored."
"High-speed streak and framing photography of surface flashover across solid insulators in vacuum is reported. Experiments were performed with direct and impulse voltages. It is shown that the initial propagation of a visible arc across an alumina surface in vacuum occurs at a speed greater than 109 cm . s-1 . It is shown that previously observed two-stage arcs under impulse voltages are the result of the interaction between the external supply and the arc impedance."

"Practical applications of vacuum as an insulator necessitated determining the low-pressure breakdown characteristics of long gap lengths of a point-plane electrode system. The breakdown voltage has been found to vary as the square root of the gap length. Further, with the point electrode as the anode, the values of the breakdown voltages obtained have been found to be larger than those obtained with a plane-parallel electrode system at a corresponding gap length. By applying the theory of the anode heating mechanism as the cause for breakdown, the results have been justified, and by utilizing a field efficiency factor which is the ratio of the average to maximum field, an empirical criterion has been developed. This criterion helps in calculating the breakdown voltage of a nonuniform gap system by the knowledge of the breakdown voltage of a plane-parallel electrode system."
"Kraft paper is used for insulation in oil-immersed equipment such as transformers. While it has given satisfactory performance on electrical and mechanical properties, thermal degradation occurs due to temperature rise in operation. Examples of these kinds of the Kraft paper are cyanoethylated Kraft paper and amine modified Kraft paper. This report indicates the ability of insulating paper immersed in new synthetic insulating oil, alkyl-naphthalene oil, to withstand somewhat higher temperature than in conventional mineral transformer oil."
"The electrical leakage of insulation exposed to moisture, particularly when salt deposits from a marine environment are also present, can degrade the performance of electrical and electronic equipment or render it inoperative until cleaned and dried. The effects of prolonged bulk moisture condensation on the surface electrical resistivities of some typical insulating materials and coatings have been studied. As in the case of exposure to relative humidities below saturation, the materials of low surface energy maintained higher resistivities. These were related to the water droplet contact angles, particularly the receding angles resulting from coalescence. Nonporous coatings with low surface energies maintained high resistivities even when applied to the poorer substrates, but porous coatings showed continual declines."
"Electrical leakage across the surface of moist insulation can be reduced by the application of water-displacing fluids, and the susceptibility of many surfaces to leakage can be reduced by protective coatings. The water-displacing abilities and the protection provided by several agents were evaluated, and a superior formulation was developed. This formulation rapidly displaced moisture to restore insulation resistivity, and dried to a solid film which maintained high resistivity upon reexposure to moisture. The film also protected metal parts against corrosion, but had a minimal effect on electrical contacts. This material should be useful in the maintenance of aircraft and shipboard electrical and electronic equipment, and will aid in the restoration to service or temporary preservation of flooded equipment. The water-displacing action is produced by the use of n-butanol in the solvent blend. The protective film is composed of a paraffin wax, an ethylenevinyl acetate copolymer, and a corrosion inhibitor."
"New safety and environmental considerations in the design and operation of modern public transportation systems exclude the use of materials that can cause fire and ecological hazards. Therefore, the power transformers in trains and subway stations require new safer insulating liquids. The askarels or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) liquids have been classified as nonflammable, but recent investigations have indicated that spills of these chlorinated liquids may have adverse ecological effects. The manufacture and use of PCB's in Japan have been prohibited by law. To meet environmental and toxicological requirements, new insulation systems for transformers were developed using silicone insulating liquids. In the evaluation of a high-voltage transformer insulation system, it is important to study partial discharge behavior in the insulating liquid. This paper describes measurements of partial discharge inception voltage and of discharge pulse amplitudes at higher test voltages in silicone liquids. The initial partial discharge inception phenomenon in both silicone liquids and mineral oils is the same and is probably related to the presence of contaminants such as water and particles in the liquids. But the further development and growth of the discharges in the liquids seem to be dependent on the chemical and physical properties of the insulating liquid. During the partial discharge measurements, it was observed that small amounts of solid material were formed on the electrode. Chemical analysis showed the material to be cross-linked polymeric siloxanes. The quantity of gelied material is a function of the partial discharge intensity and the duration of discharges."
"The polarity effect on breakdown strength is a well-known phenomenon using a nonuniform electrode system, especially point versus plate electrodes. When the point electrode is negative, particularly, free electrons move in a liquid to form negative ions due to the possibility of electron attachment to electrically neutral atoms or molecules. Negative ions form space charges, by which field stress around the point electrode relaxes. Breakdown voltages have been measured in four liquids having chemical structures differing markedly from each other. It has been found that the breakdown voltage with the point negative is higher than that with the point positive in toluene and n-octhane which have a methyl group in their molecular structure; but there is no such polarity effect in chlorobenzene and carbon tetrachloride which have chlorine atoms. It may be concluded that the polarity effect depends on molecular structure: Electrons attach to methyl groups to make negative ions which may form space charges."
"This paper outlines a method for testing the thermal stability of magnet wire by measuring the viscoelastic behavior of tubed fims obtained from magnet wire manufactured with standard equipment. It was found that there was a correlation between the glass transition temperature obtained from the mechanical tan δ versus temperature curve and the thermal class obtained from the IEEE No. 57 test method. When a magnet wire is heat aged, the mechanical tan δ peak of the film decreases. Regression curves of the mechanical tan δ peak versus aging temperature and aging time were expressed as second-order curves. The activation energies of heat aging were obtained, and compared to the activation energies obtained from the IEEE No. 57 test method."

 "Measurements are reported on the effect of specimen size and filler content on the electrical-impulse strength of epoxy polymer. For unfilled polymer, the strength was found to decrease more rapidly with increasing thickness than with increasing area. But the incorporation of as little as 1 percent by volume of filler removed the thickness effect and lowered the impulse strength. The area effect was, however, the same as for unfilled specimens. Since statistical time lags occur, it is concluded that breakdown is a random process occurring in an inhomogeneous material."
"The flashover voltage and current of a water column, which provides a suitable resistive surface for discharge propagation, have been calculated considering the heating and constriction of the column. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained under dc applied voltage for: jet lengths of 2 ⩽ L ⩽ 5 cm, initial unit length resistances of 3 ⩽ r0 ⩽35 kΩ/cm, and a rate of flow γ = 12.5 ml/s. It has been found that the flashover voltages of a given water jet arepredictable, on the average, to within 4-9 percent at positive and negative polarities."
"A new theoretical model for high-field electric conduction and breakdown in dielectric liquids based on the theory of filamentary single injection is presented. The model is based on the following postulates. 1) The high-field conduction is mainly due to electronemission from the unavoidable asperities on the metallic cathodesurface and is confined in one or more filamentary paths, in which thecurrent density is much larger than that in other regions. 2) There ispractically no impact ionization avalanche in the liquid prior to breakdown,and, at the field of breakdown strength, there is one filamentarypath in which the current density may reach such a critical value thatthe Joule heating produced in it is sufficient to initiate the thermalinstability in the vicinity of the filament and hence the onset of thebreakdown process. Expressions for the high-field conduction currentand the breakdown strength as functions of temperature, hydrostaticpressure, gap length, molecular structure, and applied voltage waveformhave been derived. The computed results are in good agreementwith currently available experimental results for hydrocarbon dielectricliquids. Previous theories based on a uniform distribution ofcurrent density over the electrode area and on an impact ionization processare also critically examined."
"An outline is given of the nature of partial dischargesoccurring in insulation structures, in particular in oil impregnatedconfigurations. It is suggested that conventional discharge measuringsystems are not always able to assess significant parameters becausemuch of the available information is inevitably discarded during thehigh-voltage tests. A mobile computer-based data-acquisition system hasbeen developed for recording and storing, in digital form, the statisticalinformation present. The equipment described is capable of recordingand analyzing the small disturbances produced by partial dischargesunder practical conditions. The computer programs enable the time ofoccurrence and the magnitude and polarity of the pulses to be recorded;in addition, digital transient-event recorders can be programmed toaccept slow partial discharge shapes or ultrasonic transducer outputsfor storage in the computer system. A wide range of playback programsare described and possible methods of presenting the results are discussedusing examples obtained from a 50-kV high-voltage test arrangement.The problems of hardware development are outlined, including thoseof interfacing and operation in hostile environments. The economics ofsuch a system are mentioned and methods of effecting cost reductionsare suggested.Finally, this paper suggests that if on-line characterization of partialdischarges becomes possible then the results of discharge measurementswill have greater significance than at present, especially in those borderlinecases where interpretation of results is difficult."
"A method of investigating partial-discharge phenomena andtheir effect on polyethylene is described. A physical study was carriedout with air at atmospheric pressure and gaps between 2 and 14 mm.It is shown, that with this range of gaps and with dielectric walls, astreamer process appears as in the case of a positive point and a metallicplane.The evolution of the polyethylene samples after the aging producedby the constituents of the discharge, i.e., UV radiation and electronsand ions of low energy, was studied by means of IR spectroscopy. Ifthe discharge is of the streamer type it might be possible to attributethe deterioration to the concentration of ions at its tip; however, IRspectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy have shown thatalthough the ions were more reactive they were not sufficiently so toexplain the damage caused by corona discharges."
"A new analysis analogous to recent work for parallel-plateelectrodes is presented using a unipolar ion-mobility conduction modelbetween concentric cylindrical or spherical electrodes. Exact solutionsare obtained for the transient behavior of the bulk electric-field andspace-charge density distributions and for the terminal current-voltage(I-V) time dependence. The analysis is generalized to handle any initialand boundary conditions for any terminal constraints or excitations.Using the method of characteristics, the governing first-orderchargeconservation quasi-linear partial differential equation is converted into aset of first-order ordinary differential equations. It is shown that forcurrent source excitations these equations can be easily integrated,while for voltage-source excitations the equations are in the correctform for the Runge-Kutta method of numerical integration. Thecoaxial cylindrical geometry is emphasized, treating the special cases ofthe charging transients to a step voltage or current from rest underspace-charge limited conditions and the discharging transients ofsystems which are in the dc steady state and instantaneously open- orshort-circuited. The solutions are computer drawn in three dimensionsusing a recently available graphics package."
"The nature of metal/SF6 reactions under direct-current(dc) simulated circuit-breaker conditions has been examined in orderto explore: 1) the identity of the process(es) responsible for the differentmagnitudes of electrode consumption for various pure metals; 2)the factors determining the different rates of reaction with SF6observed for different metals. It is concluded that high-current arcerosion, which would be expected to consume the metal in the absence ofSF6, is also the primary mode of weight loss of electrodes in thepresence of SF6. The rates of reaction of the evaporated metals seem to berelated to their tendencies to attack SF6 at the sulphur \"site\" and not,as is generally assumed, at the fluorine \"sites.\" Rather good correlationsare observed between the reaction rates and the heats of formationper equivalent for metal sulphides or the electrode potentials formetal/metal sulphide electrodes."
"The solid-state cohesion of metals maintaining electricalstress across a vacuum gap appears to determine the magnitude of theelectric strength of the vacuum gap. For conditioned electrodes(presumably free of adsorbed and oxide layers) under direct-voltage conditions,higher electric strengths are associated with metals having highmetal-metal bond energies and vice versa."
"Photographs have been taken of microdischarges whichoccur when a metal particle approaches an electrode in an electricallystressed oil gap. The total stress in the oil between the particle and theelectrode is similar to the breakdown stress recorded for oil gaps ofsimilar spacing."
"Charge or RIV techniques for corona (partial discharge)have been used in factory tests of high-voltage oil-filled equipment.Such tests have also been used in the field. More recently, measurementsof evolved gas have been made as well.In the laboratory, the effect of corona in oil has been determinedlargely by measuring gas evolution using the Pirelli test, in whichdischarges take place in oil vapor. A new technique-the floating-electrodecell-has been developed to obtain controlled discharges in oil. Tomonitor the discharges, histograms of the number of pulses versusthe pulse magnitude are obtained periodically. Provision is made todetermine the amount and nature of evolved gas with both the\"floating-electrode\" and Pirelli cells. When paper or pressboard as wellas oil is used, the development of x wax has been observed with scanningelectron microscopy (SEM).Results are reported for conventional transforner oil and dodecylbenzeneand a naphthenic white oil from which all aromatic componentshave been removed."

 "In this paper, a technique for determining the behavior of thin-wire antennas mounted radially on a conducting sphere is formulated. The method of analysis involves the derivation of an integral equation for the antenna current. By a proper choice of boundary conditions, a modified Green's tensor for the sphere can be defined. This limits the range of the integral equation to over the thin wires only, thereby permitting a relatively simple solution for the antenna currents."
"Presented are various numerical results illustrating the behavior of thin monopole antennas located on a perfectly conducting sphere. The method of analysis, described in a previous paper, uses an integral equation solution for the unknown wire currents, and a modified Green's function to limit the range of integration to over the wires only. Studies are made of the input quantities, radiated currents and induced sphere currents for various antenna geometries. A comparison of the computed input impedance of monopole on the sphere is made with experimental data and good agreement is noted."
"A quantitative comparison is made of the importance of mutual inductance and mutual capacitance in the leakage of transient signals through the braid of a coaxial cable. The difference between mutual inductance and mutual capacitance coupling is vividly exhibited in the transient predictions.

"From a study on gratings for certain types of EMP simulators, the charge distribution is calculated on a grid of uniformly spaced rods in two different cases, namely, i) a grid of rods above a ground plane and ii) a grid of rods between two parallel plates. In each case numerical calculations are carried out for both the maximum value of the normal component of the electric field at the surface of each rod and the effective electric height of the grid, i.e., the distance between two parallel plates having the same capacitance per unit cell as the considered grid. Different expressions of the potential due to a two-dimensional lattice of line charges are also derived."
"A real-time digital video processor using Hadamard transform techniques to reduce video bandwidth is described. The processor can be programmed with different parameters to investigate various algorithms for bandwidth compression. The processor is also adaptive in that it can select different parameter sets to trade-off spatial resolution for temporal resolution in the regions of the picture that are moving. Algorithms used in programming the system are described along with results achieved at various levels of compression. The algorithms relate to spatial compression, temporal compression, and the adaptive selection of parameter sets."
"Impedance measurements were made of 86 commercial 50-Hz AC power distribution systems throughout the LF-HF (0.02-30 MHz) spectrum in six European countries. The impedances are those presented to devices/appliances connected to the ac power source. The European results are presented in graphic and tabular form and are compared to impedances of U.S. power lines."
"The stated purpose is to demonstrate the applicability of texture measurements for making distinctions between classes of imagery. Multispectral images obtained from aircraft and satellites have been successfully delineated into land use classes on the basis of density in the different spectral bands. However, spatial patterns can add additional information to improve classification accuracy. A comparison is made between the results obtained using five texture algorithms for separating land use classes using ERTS imagery. The transforms evaluated are the Karhunen-Loeve, the fast Fourier, the Walsh-Hadamard, the Slant, and a digital matched filter."
"Presented are the results of an investigation of the near-field Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) associated with the operation of pocket calculators. A review of the regulations governing the permissible levels of interference from portable electronic equipment is undertaken, and subsequently, the results of EMI measurements on three pocket calculators are presented. The results indicate that near-field EMI levels are of sufficient magnitude to make questionable the unrestricted operation of a pocket calculator in an electromagnetically sensitive environment, such as found on an aircraft flight deck. Finally, a simple and inexpensive means of eliminating this interference is investigated."
"A discussion is presented regarding the presence of natural and man-made electric fields in our environment. It is seen that biological objects readily come into contact with such fields. The interaction of some biological objects with electric fields is presented as well as original experimentation in this area. One experiment discussed deals with the influence of a 245 V/in (96.5 V/cm) electric field on the glucose concentration (as measured by per cent transmission) of human red blood cells. The data presented show an influence by the field. The second experiment discussed deals with the behavioral manifestations of electric fields on rats. An approach-avoidance procedure is utilized. The data presented shows an avoidance response at a high electric field intensity (4.5 kV/in) (1.77 kV/cm). Practical applications of this area of study are also presented."

 "A method using a reverberating enclosure for evaluating the radiation of an apparatus in the microwave range (1-18 GHz)is described. The physical performance of the reverberating enclosure has been analyzed by means of a sampling correlator. The method is particularly suitable for measurements of radiated interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (I.S.M.) equipment in terms of power, and to state their compliance with specified limits. Other important applications of the reverberating enclosure may include the measurement of average absorption coefficient of bulk or plate materials and of the behavior of the human body in an EM microwave field."
"This paper reviews passive and active building elements for RFI suppression: inductors, capacitors, frequency-sensitive and voltagesensitive resistors, and their interconnections to form multipole structures, of lumped and distributed types. After presentation of the state of the art, rules are given for the design of good RFI components. Trends are shown in new developments, especially the new technologies of manufacturing special dielectric and magnetic media. The possibility is discussed of generalizing the concept of \"damping\" as compared to pure reactive \"filtering.\" Some recent research and development results are presented concerning components spreading RFI suppression along distributed structures, the important role of partition, and finally, integrated \"dielectromagnetic\" structures."

"A technique for improving the electromagnetic compatibility of a radar system with respect to its operating electromagnetic environment and to assess RF spectrum usage is presented. The technique involves the use of the ambiguity diagram derived from the waveform and the construction of environinental diagrams for the radar. Overlays of the ambiguity diagram upon the environmental diagram, along desired target trajectories, provide a pictorial view by which EMC analysis and spectrum usage can be interpreted. The technique lends itself to the early phases in radar concept or development where waveform design can be modified. The technique also lends itself to assessing design towards receivèr interference rejection. Only nominal system parameter data is required for implementation."
"A special case of FWT is examined where a scheme is devised to replace a single high-order FWT by consecutive FWT's of much lower order. This special case of the usual decimation-in-frequency approach to fast transforms [1] results in a reduction of transform order, which may have useful applications in processing signals in localized sequency regions."

"A limited study of man-made impulsive noise was made at 76 and 200 kHz. The purpose of the study was to collect data in various locations to be used as noise models for man-made noise simulators. Impulsive noise data were taken of automotive systems, industrial sites, and residential areas. Two classes of noise, both class A and B, are shown and, for comparative purposes, some atmospheric radio noise data are included."
"Utilization of state space analysis techniques for investigating transient noise generation in electrical networks is covered and an example is provided. Physical phenomena occurring in these networks are considered in the frequency domain and the analysis is restricted to networks which can be simplified to constant parameters embodying ideal electric switches. Basic transient noise mechanisms are explained. Modeling techniques for the transient noise generating sources consistent with the state space analysis approach are given."
"This paper intends to put to rest a longstanding EMC controversy. Thus far an interrelated set of unresolved problems existed for power feed line filters. One never knew whether or not they would behave as predicted; that is, would they attenuate in the stopband, as desired, and/or ring in the passband, as not desired? Successful testing, according to accepted standards, does not guarantee satisfactory performance in the real world. This problematique is solved by combining extreme-value theory (newly applied) of mismatch with application of a properly categorized statistical data base (now established) on interface impedances. The delineation of the surprisingly transparent conditions for filter dysfunction permits establishment of practical measures for design and testing of filters that must often work under indeterminate and fluctuating interface conditions."
"It is shown that the effective transfer impedance per unit length of a thin coaxial cable shield is given by Zs h2/Ys, where ZS and Ys are, respectively, the cable's inductive transfer impedance per unit length and capacitive transfer admittance per unit length, and h is the axial propagation constant. This general result is illustrated by consideration of a specific shield model, the M-filar filamentary helix."
"There are many pulse-coded sequence solutions for a pulse compression design that are available from D. A. Huffman's polynomial approach. If a sequence of length 13 is considered then there are 122 independent sequence solutions for the autocorrelation function of design. Out of this diversity of possible solutions some will be usable because pulse train energy utilization is high. The components of any chosen sequence possess different amplitude and phase excitation values which could be implemented by today's technology. In this paper an \"interference blanker\" is defined as a device that permits simultaneous operation of two or more pulse compression equipments so that there is no suppression of range resolution accuracy. The pulse compression decoder for the modified D. A. Huffman impulse-equivalent pulse trains is shown to be an \" interference blanker\" because the cross-correlation function between any two usable sequence solutions shows great variation from the autocorrelation function of design. Because in a practical implementation, there is a limit to the time sidelobe reduction that can be accomplished, D. A. Huffman's zero time sidelobe condition is modified. As an example, the ten most favorable sequence solutions for the time sidelobe level of 32.3 dB and a sequence length 13 are studied."

 "When making EMC measurements inside a shielded enclosure, the radiation characteristics of the device being tested changes. In this paper, the change in radiation resistance of dipole sources located inside a National Bureau of Standards TEM transmission cell is determined. In many cases a practical device can be modeled by dipole sources. In these cases the analysis allows one to predict the device's radiation characteristics in other environments (e. g., free space)."
"The need and advantages of lossy elements in unconditional EMC filter design are well recognized. This paper describes a lossy device based on the proximity effect using multilayer strip lines. Expressions are derived for the losses in the multilayer strip conductors. Experimental data show good agreement with theoretical expectations when the differences between the theoretical model and actual implementations are taken into account. The formula for an infinite stack provides a theoretical upper limit to the losses as a function of frequency. A modified empirical formula provides a practical design equation. Applications are also discussed."
"RF shielding effectiveness and light transmittance of acopper or silver film coating on a plastic substrate is investigated. The dependence of the RF shielding effectiveness upon the surface resistance or thickness of a copper or silver film coating on a plastic substrate is calculated numerically by means of multireflection transmission-line theory over the frequency range of 100 MHz to 30 GHz. The light transmansmittance is determined by using the optical properties of the copper or silver film and plastic substrate. An optimum condition between the RF shielding effectiveness and the light transmittance is established for the copper or silver film coating on a plastic substrate."
"A numerical method is presented for determining the electromagnetic field diffracted by an aperture in an infinite conducting plate. Comparisons are made with the results of approximations valid at low frequencies and high frequencies. Calculations of the electromagnetic field components in the aperture, in the near zone of the aperture, and in the far zone of the aperture are made and are compared with available measured data"
"A statistical model was developed for predicting and describing the out-of-band pattern characteristics of phased arrays containing ferrite phase shifters. Statistical analysis techniques are necessary because experimental investigations showed that the propagation of higher-order modes at out-of-band frequencies cause phased arrays containing ferrite phase shifters not only to respond differently at out-of-band frequencies but also to exhibit random behavior. Equations were derived which relate the out-of-band pattern scanning properties, relative gain levels, median gain, and standard deviation to the in-band scan angle and the ferrite phase shifter statistics. Computer algorithms were written to both compute and graphically display the out-of-band antenna patterns. Experimentally derived phase-shift data were used as inputs to the model. The results of these investigations show that statistical analysis techniques are potentially very useful in an EMC context for characterizing out-of-band responses of phased array antennas"
"An idealized model of a trolley wire communication system in a tunnel is considered. To facilitate the analysis the tunnel cross section is taken to be semicircular and the surrounding rock medium is homogeneous with a finite conductivity. The metallic rails or other conductors on the flat floor of the tunnel are represented by a plane metallic reflecting surface of infinite extent. The trolley wire and associated feeder line are assumed to be equivalent to a single cylindrical conductor that is parallel to the axis of the tunnel but located anywhere within the cross section. The appropriate modal equation is then solved for the propagation constant of the dominant mode. It is shown that the attenuation rate increases significantly as the trolley wire approaches the tunnel wall. However, even when the trolley wire is within 20 cm (8 in) of the wall, the attenuation rate at 200 kHz is still less than 2 dB per kilometer."
"In a recent paper [1], a method for computing the per-unitlength generalized capacitance matrix of a system of dielectric-insulated wires was given.

Certain approximate formulas for large wire separations are also given. Rome Air Development Center."

"The current induced by a harmonic electromagnetic plane wave in an infinitely long wire is discussed. Two methods of calculating this current for a wire situated in vacuum will be compared: 1) one by Mohr [1] and 2) a direct calculation, which is given in Section II of this paper. Mohr's method 1) utilizes transmission line theory and the case of perpendicular incidence discussed in Jordan's book [2]. In the direct method 2) only Maxwell's equations and boundary conditions are used. When the direct method is presented in Section II, the wire is assumed to be situated in an arbitrary infinite homogeneous medium, not necessarily in a vacuum. In fact the direct method allows also the thickness and the material of the wire to be arbitrary, and so any infinitely long circular cylinder can be considered. It seems that the currents determined by Mohr's method and the direct method have roughly the same order of magnitude (at least), if the electromagnetic wave has a high-altitude-EMP frequency and is incident on a copper wire whose radius is less than about 1 cm and the angle between the line and the direction of propagation of the wave is above 45 ° . The agreement between Mohr's method and the direct method is better, the more perpendicular the incidence, the lower the frequency, or the smaller the radius of the wire."
"A simple method for generating a class of time-sequency-amplitude plots called Walsh spectrograms is presented. A Fortran computer program which enables one to generate such spectrograms readily is provided. Illustrative examples related to generating spectro-grams associated with pulse-code modulation and speech data are included."
"The expressions for Walsh functions in terms of shifted Rademacher functions are applicable to the design of a directive and selective array antenna for Walsh waves which is capable of eliminating the interference caused by impulsive noises. They also are applicable to voice processing because of their shift-invariant property. The shifted Rademacher functions were previously introduced by shiftiAg horizontally the periodic Rademacher functions. It was shown that the Walsh functions could be expressed as a linear combination of a finite number of the shifted Rademacher functions. This paper develops the actual expansions of the Walsh functions in terms of the shifted Rademacher functions. The coefficients in this series take only the values of either + 1 or -1. The shifted Rademacher coefficients appearing in the expansion of a given function in tenns of shifted Rademacher functions have the advantage that the coefficients of a shifted function are available by shifting cyclically the original coefficients."

 "This paper reviews the fundamentals of cryptographic digital systems and defines and discusses the two basic types of ciphers. The remainder of this article examines the word and bit error rates in digital al communication systems with block or stream ciphers. Upper bounds and ensemble averages of the error rates are obtained for both ciphers. The effect of modulation type on the degradation in communication system performance caused by the addition of cryptography is analyzed. A comparison is made between block and stream ciphers with respect to their effects on degradation."
"The following paper derives a general gradient process for extremization ion by imposing an \" exponential decay\" condition on the controlled variable. The general process is applied to two adaptive linear filter problems; a sonar application by Widrow [3] and a radar problem of Brennan & Reed [4]. The results are discussed in sections 11 and Ill, respectively. A central feature of the Fletcher-Powell process [1] is a matrix modification algorithm due to Davidon [2]. It is shown in Appendix A that this algorithm may be derived using the same exponential condition imposed on the proper error term."

"Diffuse multipath is a random phenomenon that arises out of the diffraction of waves from rough surfaces. This form of multipath can in turn affect the angle estimation performance of monopulse antenna systems. In order to evaluate its effect, it is necessary to obtain the channel spread function that results. This function is basically the wave number spectrum of the resulting random field generated by the scattering. To do this, use is made of the Kodis-Barrick arrick scattering cross section and Wagner's shadowing function. The evaluation is performed for the specific geometry of a spherical earth. Evaluation of the system performance degradation is made for various angle estimation system configurations."
"Jump phenomena are known to exist in many non-linear systems [I], [2], [3]. The non-linear analysis presented in this paper explains and predicts the conditions for the jump phenomenon that is observed in a phase-locked loop (PLL) preceded by an automatic gain control (AGC). The jump phenomenon occurs when the frequency separation AM of two sinusoids at the input to the AGC is greater than the bandwidth B of the linearized PLL. If the loop is initially locked to the stronger signal, the weaker signal will frequency-modulate the PLL voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a modulation frequency AI. The amplitude S2 of the weaker signal al can be increased until it becomes greater than the amplitude Si of the signal being tracked, without causing the loop to lose lock; i. e., the VCO continues to track the original signal. However, if the ratio of the amplitudes S2 S1 = R is increased above some critical value RC > 1, the loop will lose lock on the original signal, and jump to track the interfering signal. If the frequency separation is at least twice the PLL bandwidth, a good approximation for this critical ratio is Rc ≅ Δw/B."
"Under the assumption that the non-independent range samples fed into the rank quantizer form a first-order Markov sequence, the first threshold false alarm probability Pn is written in the form of a multiple integral, the multiplicity being equal to the number of samples or quantizer taps. The Rice model for narrow-band noise (clutter) is used to check the effect of correlation on Pn using the derived formula. For the limited case examined, correlation be tween samples decreases Pn as compared with the independent samples case."
"Eclipsing of received signals is analyzed for Interrupted Continuous Wave (ICW) radars. A probability density for the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at the Doppler filter output is derived which incorporates eclipsing effects and a fluctuating target cross section model. The probability of detection as a function of SNR is calculated for typical ICW parameters and the magnitude of the detection loss due to eclipsing is assessed"

"The response of a linear phased array with a matched filter connected at its output is investigated when a linear FM signal is incident on the array at an arbitrary angle. The filter is assumed to be matched to the linear FM signal. The dispersion produced by the array results in a mismatch at the receiver which depends on the scan angle and on the type of feed system used with the array. The distortion of the compressed pulse is studied for the series end-fed arrays, the series"
"This correspondence describes distribution-free processors based on the theory of runs. No assumption about either the functional form of the distribution of noise or the nature of its distribution is made. Hence the processors described are expected to yield constant false alarm (CFA) irrespective of the nature of noise encountered in the system."
"This correspondence considers the problem of optimal regulator design for discrete time linear systems subjected to white state-dependent and control-dependent noise in addition to additive white noise in the input and the observations. A pseudo-deterministic problem is first defined in which multiplicative and additive input disturbances are present, but noise-free measurements of the complete state vector are available. This problem is solved via discrete dynamic programing. Next is formulated the problem in which the number of measurements is less than that of the state variables and the measurements are contaminated with state-dependent noise. The inseparability of control and estimation is brought into focus, and an \"enforced separation\" solution is obtained via heuristic reasoning in which the control gains are shown to be the same as those in the pseudo-deterministic problem. An optimal linear state estimator is given in order to implement the controller."
"In [1] a scheme for forming a rectangular FIR filter bank is described using only a few percent of the number of multiplications required by straightforward procedures. The sidelobe level suffers degradation. Attention is drawn to a different scheme published in [2] and [3] which needs even fewer multiplications without degradationvof the sidelobe level."

 "This paper demonstrates and tests a new algorithm for extracting velocity information from a pulse Doppler radar signal. The system is adaptive and performs weil in the presence of target scintillation. This paper also shows a special steady-state version of the adaptive algorithm. lt is computationally attractive and produces near optimal velocity estimates."
"The shunt-type transient suppressor currently being used by the U.S. Army for suppression of voltage transients in tactical and combat vehicles is applicable to military aircraft as well. Advances in metal-oxide varistor technology have led to the development of a low-cost, low-voltage device having a breakdown voltage designed for use in 28-V dc electrical systems. This paper discusses the avalanche diode and the metal-oxide varistor as high-power transient suppressors. lt shows that the metal-oxide varistor has a less effective voltage clamp at the required breakdown level of 33 to 36 volts."
"The mobility of our society makes effective and efficient operation of our air terminals a necessity. For this reason, landing trajectories must be optimized. One important factor in the performance index is aircraft noise received by people residing near the terminal. This paper develops a mathematical model of this noise effect so that it may be included in the performance index. The model yields the boundary on the ground inside of which the noise level is at or above 70 dB. This area can be weighted with the population density. The model compares very favorably with available data."
"Pulse train detection of fluctuating targets whose coherence time is long compared to the time between pulses and short compared to the pulse train duration is compared for two systems: (1) a recursive digital optimal receiver operating in conjunction with a coherent pulse train transmitter, and (2) a good (but not optimal) receiver operating with a block coherent frequency-hopping transmitter. The equivalence of this type of problem to noise-in-noise detection problems is demonstrated, the performance relations for both systems are derived and comparisons are made."
"Minimum mean-square-error demodulators for pulse-frequency-modulated signals are considered. The optimum demodulator structure is found and a suboptimum one is proposed that may be implemented by standard circuitry."
"Implementation and convergence of adaptive processors are of continuing interest. To this end, a fast-adapting, linear, general recursive matrix-filtering algorithm is described. Two complex xoefficients are optimized at each recursion. A signal and interference estimation procedure is included. Results for some low-resolution, frequency domain beamformer trials with two targets, and using a single sample set, are presented. Considerable adaptive improvement occurs, along with target resolution, compared with a correlation beamformer. The algorithm shows rapid and direct convergence."
"Echoes from complex targets due to chirp waveforms show different time responses for different chirp rates, because of the ambiguity of range and radial velocity information. A graphical method is described which enables the derivation of the time response for an arbitrary chirp rate when the scattering cross-section distribution in the range and radial velocity plane is known for complex targets. The graphical method can also be used to generate an approximately realistic scattering cross-section distribution when the time responses for two different chirp rates are given. An example is shown which applies to the computer simulation of the radar echo from a waking reentry space vehicle."
"Polar decomposition of matrices is used here to investigate the convergence properties of iterative orthogonalization processes. It is shown that, applying this decomposition, the investigation of a general iterative process of a certain form can be reduced to the investigation of a scalar iterative process which is simple. Three known iterative orthogonalization processes, which are special cases of the general process, are analyzed, their convergence rate (order) is determined, and their range of convergence is established in terms of the spectral radius of the modulus of the matrix which is being orthogonalyzed."
"A technique for utilizing on-board sensed horizon profiles and computer stored reference horizon profiles to provide navigation checkpoints for low-altitude aircraft is described. The technique has been analyzed using digitized terrain data and computer simulations to select the best method of horizon profile comparison, to determine horizon data density requirements, and to provide performance comparisons, system error limitations, and tradeoffs. Results of these analyses are shown to support feasibility conclusions and system parameter tradeoffs."
"The High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO) main bus regulator contains a redundant error amplifier (REA) and a 12-section sequenced shunt transconductance amplifier (STA) in which not more than three and not less than one shunt section are in an active control mode regardless of a failure in any one of the twelve sections. The part of the work concerned with the shaping of the frequency response of the REA and STA minor feedback loops and of the teolator major feedback loop is described. Emphasis is on the application of a general design technique embodying a \"design-analyze-measure iteration loop,\" in which a first-cut design and analysis is corrected ard improved after experimental observation of discrepancies and deficiencies. In particular, an incipient high-frequency oscillation was thereby reliably eliminated. It is demonstrated that analysis techniques involving a minimum of algebra can provide full quantitative information on an efficient and reliable system design."
"Evaluation of the probability of error in decision feedback equalizers is difficult due to the presence of a hard limiter in the feedback path. This paper derives the upper and lower bounds on the probability of a single error and multiple error patterns. The bounds are fairly tight. The bounds can also be used to select proper tap gains of the equalizer."
"A method of estimating the angle of arrival of a signal at an array of sensors in an external noise environment is outlined. The development is based on a maximum likelihood estimator and leads naturally to adaptive sum and difference beams which null the external noise sources. An algorithm for estimating angle of arrival, based on the outputs of adaptively distorted sum and differnce beams, is shown to perform well in the presence of sidelobe and/or main beam interference."
"Taylor-series estimation gives a least-sum-squared-error solution to a set of simultaneous linearized algebraic equations. This method is useful in solving multimeasurement mixed-mode position-location problems typical of many navigational applications. While convergence is not proved, examples show that most problems do converge to the correct solution from reasonable initial guesses. The method also provides the statistical spread of the solution errors."
"A general method is presented for synthesizing weighting coefficients for arrays of sensors or for finite-impulse-response (FIR) digital filters. The beam pattern of the array or the frequency response of the digital filter is a weighted, least mean-square (LMS) approximation to a desired function, subject to constrained pattern values at specified points. The method is applied to the problem of producing beam patterns of a line array for the rejection of interfering point sources. For this case, we show that adaptive array processing can be based on modification of the roots of the array polynomial."
"Exact and simplified expressions are derived for the calibration of raw target coordinate measurements obtained from a tracking radar, The measured target position in angle is indicated by the displacement of the antenna boresight. The true target position, however, deviates from this measured value because of such system biases as tilt (leveling error), nonorthogonality of axes, collimation error, dynamic lag, etc. These and other biases are accounted for in this paper. The pedestal configuration assumed is an elevation over azimuth mount. A noise-free environment is also assumed."
"Two digital filters are presented, which are suited for generating (Correlation) or suppressing (decorrelation) by approximation time-discrete signals with preset autocorrelation function from white noise. The advantage of these suboptimal filters is that the determination of their coefficients is very simple. For this reason the filters are weil suited for generating or suppresing signals with rapidly varying statistical parameters. One application possibility is the simulation and the adaptive suppression of clutter signals in surveillance radar systems."
"This paper analyzes third-order phase-locked loops with an arbitrary phase-detector characteristic and imperfect integration by the quasi-stationary approach with a suitable linearization of the non-linear differential equation deseribing the loop behavior; ideal integration is also considered. The main feature of this technique is the use of an easy mathematical approach which allows a direct physical insight into acquisition behavior and the development of simple expressions for the time and pull-in range."
"This paper considers bit synchronization through the use of a separate clock signal which is either amplitude modulated onto or summed with the data signal. For continuous data transmission, such schemes are known to be inferior, in the sense of efficient use of power, to schemes which derive synchronization directly from the data signal. However, these techniques have application in burst systems such as spacecraft command systems, and in systems where receiver simplicity is more important than power conservation. For systems in which the composite data-clock signal subsequently modulates an RF carrier, it is shown that the summed clock signal performs slightly better than the AM clock signal, and that for both signal types, the optimum allocation of power between data and clock is approximately 9:1."
"A sequential detection scheme with combined decision and information feedbacks, where the signal amplitude at each iteration may be properly programmed, is analyzed. This approach allows a remarkable gain in transmission rate and a significant reduction in the peak-to-average power ratio, relative to the nonsequential scheme with constant signal amplitude."
"The radar transmission equation for a harmonic radar operating over a planar, finite dielectric Earth through foliage is derived for an interesting class of nonlinear scatterers. The received power can typically depend on range to the (-14) power for small objects near the ground. The maximum detection range of a ground-based system is related to all major system parameters: it is most sensitive to polarization, transmit antenna height, and transmit wavelength; moderately sensitive to transmit power and transmit antenna area; and least sensitive to receive antenna area, harmonic scattering cross section, and mode of data processing. For example, there is seen to be a best apportionment of total available aperture area into disjoint transmit and receive apertures which can be well approximated by the equal gain condition. Also, there is seen to be a critical path distance through foliage; at distances less than this, small wavelengths are desirable and, conversely, the upper transmit frequency limit may be set by nonlinear scatterer response. Airborne synthetic aperture radar systems are discussed and quantification of harmonic noise and effects of scatterer fluctuation are made. A useful phenomenological model of a nonlinear scatterer is given that is consistent with some observations and predicts a frequency dependence. Nonlinear scatterer effects on range resolution are discussed."
"Optimum estimation (tracking) of the polarization plane of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is determined when the signal is a narrow-band Gaussian random process with a polarization plane angle which is also a Gaussian random process. This model is Compared to previous work and is applicable to space communication. The estimator performs a correlation operation similar to an amplitude -comparison monopulse angle tracker, giving the name correlation polarimeter. Under large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the estimator is causal. Performance of the causal correlation polarimeter is evaluated for arbitrary SNR. Optimum precorrelation filtering is determined. With low SNR, the performance of this system is far better than that of previously developed systems. Practical implementation is discussed. A scheme is given to reduce the effect of linearly polarized noise."
"One of the problems that plague emitter location systems is the presence of data from emitters that are in motion. If this motion is not detected, erroneous location estimates and filled data files result. An algorithm to classify an emitter as moving or stationary is presented along with extensive illustrations and results based upon simulated data."
"The development of electronic surveillance systems that can accurately measure the direction of arrival of signals from ground radar stations has opened the possibility of using statistical techniques to determine navigation information for the measuring vehicle. The method of combining \"bearing\" observations from several radar sites for navigational purposes, referred to as \"back triangulation\", will be discussed and demonstrated by simulation."
"Methods are given to determine the performance loss caused by imperfect or noisy phase recovery and its use in coherent detection of a PSK signal. Numerical results for both binary and quaternary systems are presented so that these results combined with the characteristics of the phase recovery circuit will enable the \"best\" practical design of a PSK receiver. lt is assumed that the phase noise associated with the recovered carrier can have a nonzero mean and a Gaussian or a truncated Gaussian-type distribution. The static error of the phase noise is mostly due to offset frequency tracking of the phaselocked loop used to recover the carrier, but may also include an equivalent phase error produced by the comparator dead zone. The random component of the phase noise is due to thermal noise present in the recovery circuit and is also due to the random modulation that may be present on the carrier. Two plausible probability density functions are assumed for the random component of the phase noise to study the sensitivity of the detection results to the detailed characteristics of the phase noise. For small values of static error and phase noise variance and for moderate values of signal-to-noise ratio, it is shown that the two models of the probability distribution give essentially the same results. Since the exact method of determining the performance is rather complex, we also present some simple upper bounds."
"A simple algorithm is described for the calculation of range in a multiple pulse repitition frequency (PRF) radar. The computational logic requires only a few multiplications and a number of logical operations. The method is described for two systems, one with two PRF's using medium PRF ranging and the other for three PRF's using high PRF ranging. The method described is considerably simpler and more understandable than the currently used methods for similar types of computations [1]."
"The gyrotorquer dynamics problem treated earlier by Greensite [1] is discussed. lt is shown that the method of derivation adopted by Greensite fails to generate some important dynamic terms in the original motion equations."
"Circular average error (CAE) and spherical average error (SAE) are defined as alternatives to the circular error probable (CEP) and spherical error probable (SEP) as univariate measures of error ellipses and ellipsoids for two-and three-dimensional radars. Results are expressed graphically. Approximate formulas are given for all four measures."
"The work of Crow and Tausworthe on design and response of thirdorder phase-lock loops (PLL) is extended. The response of a particular third-order PLL to a pulse of jerk (an acceleration ramp of finite duration) is determined by application of the basic convolution theorem to the acceleration-step response of a particular thirdorder PLL."
"The global positioning system (GPS) is a satellite navigation system currently under development by the Department of Defense. This correspondence describes a new position fix algorithm for a low-cost GPS receiver. The algorithm uses Hotelling's method to iteratively update the inverse of the measurement matrix for correction of the"
"In practice there are some cases where the signal and the noise of the message vary in the same manner with time. The time-varying filter then becomes quite simple and attractive. lt consists of the classical Wiener's filter multiplied and divided by the time-dependent deterministic function. Two examples of airborne tracking radar used in a dog-fight attack and an airborne laser range finder are presented as examples of the possible realization of such filters."

 "A definitive analysis technique is proposed for designing wind generating plants to produce electrical energy at minimum cost. The method employs variation in essential design parameters: rated power level, rated wind velocity, design wind velocity, and number of generator poles. These parameters in turn define wind turbine radius, turbine speed, rated torque at step-up gear input, and step-up gear ratio. When these are combined with site (or region) specific wind statistics, appropriate wind plant cost functions, and criteria by which to compute annual cost of ownership, the result yields the cost of produced energy for the several design variations. The selected design is that one for which the cost of produced energy is minimum."
"The first-order probability density at the output of the correlation network of the delay-lock discriminator is determined using the methods developed by Arthur, Kac, and Siegert. The analysis assumes that the input signal is stationary and Gaussian and that the discriminator is locked on. No restrictions are made on the bandpass filter characteristics in the channels."
"The requirements, design, implementation, and flight performance of an on-board image compression system for the lunar orbiting Radio Astronomy Explorer-2 (RAE-2) spacecraft are described. The image to be compressed is a panoramic camera view of the long radio astronomy antenna booms used for gravity-gradient stabilization of the spacecraft. A compression ratio of 32 to 1 is obtained by a combination of scan line skipping and adaptive run-length coding. The compressed imagery data are convolutionally encoded for error protection. This image compression system occupies about 1000 cm2 and consumes 0.4 W."
"Quantization rules are examined for a satellite radiometer in the visual range. Effects of photomultiplier tube (PMT) noise on the detection of cloud brightness levels are of particular interest because the expected radiance levels are high. Effects of area integration are considered to improve the probability of detection at high radiance levels."
"Current technology has evolved low cost, highly reliable solid state vector magnetometers with excellent angular resolution. This paper discusses the role of a three-axis magnetometer as a new instrument for aircraft attitude determination. Using flight data acquired by an instrumented aircraft, attitude is calculated using the Earth's magnetic field vector and compared to measured attitudes. The magnetic field alone is not adequate to resolve all attitude variations and the need for a second reference angle or vector is discussed. A system combining the functions of heading determination and attitude measurement is presented to show that both functions can be implemented with essentially the same component count required to measure heading alone. lt is concluded that with the correlation achieved in calculated and measured attitude there is a potential application of vector magnetometry in attitude measurement systems."
"This paper investigates the possibility of generating an on-off limit cycle mode in the WHECON attitude control system. lt is shown that, by eliminating the off set angle α in the roll-actuated control torquer, the WHECON system can be reduced to the structure considered earlier by Mendel and, therefore, an on-off limit cycle can be generated simply by introducing an appropriate amount of asymmetry into the deadzone characteristic of the WHECON controller. Because with this mode of on-off limit cycle the thruster jets will fire only once in each cycle of the oscillation, it is claimed that a considerable amount of fuel can be saved by the proposed modifications to the original WHECON design. Dynamic simulation study was conducted with the actual nonlinear model of the WHECON system considered and the results indicate that, for both zero and nonzero values of the off set angle α, substantial fuel savings can be achieved by using the asymmetric controller."
"Optimal and suboptimal guidance laws for short-range homing missiles are developed and compared to the commonly mechanized quidance law of proportional navigation. The optimal controller is derived as an optimal feedback regulator; the suboptimal controller is an approximation of the optimal regulator and consists of timevarying proportional navigation plus a time-varying gain term times a calculated target acceleration. Monte Carlo studies of the three controllers show that the optimal and suboptimal controllers are much superior to proportional navigation for the case of combined constant target acceleration, line-of-sight rate noise, and missile acceleration saturation."
"The optimum (maximum likelihood criterion) bit synchronizer for phase-noncoherent reception of binary FSK signals is found and a suboptimum implementation of it is derived. The performance of this circuit is analyzed in the presence of thermal noise, and the expression of the timing jitter variance is obtained in the case of relatively large signal-to-noise ratios."
"Optimum weighting is used to adaptively increase the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of signal processors. The precision required in computing the weights is evaluated. Analytic results have been obtained and verified by computer simulation. lt is shown that for antenna adaptivity the required weight precision increases with increasing values of the attainable SIR improvement and with the number of auxiliary elements. A typical result is that when using 8 auxiliary elements with a theoretical SIR improvement of 40 dB, quantizing the optimum weights to 10 bits degrades the improvement by at most 3 dB."
"A new procedure for the selection of magnetic cores for use in energy-storage dc-to-dc power converters that eliminates the need for an automated computer search algorithm and stored data file is presented. The converter configurations included in the procedure are the three commonly encountered single-winding converters for voltage stepup, for current stepup and voltage stepup/current stepup, and for the two-winding converter for voltage stepup/current stepup. For each converter configuration, three types of controllers are considered: constant-frequency, constant on-time, and constant off-time. Using concepts developed from analyses of these converters by considering the transfer of energy by means of an energystorage inductor or transformer, a special table of parameters calculated from magnetic core data is constructed, which leads to a considerably simplified design procedure."
"The response of an FM detector to an FM signal which is passed through a hard limiting repeater together with additive Gaussian noise is described. A general expression of the output SNR is derived that enables the determination of the threshold behavior. To clarify the feature of a transmission characteristic, a comparison with a linear repeater is also made. The output SNR is found to be larger than that of the linear system for all practical values of input CNR's."
"A first cut at the difficult problem of the identification and removal of ambiguous responses to radar burst waveforms is presented. Assuming that two bursts are used, algorithms for multitarget ambiguity removal after coincidence detection are presented and illustrated by examples. The results may have significant application in ballistic missile defense surveillance radars."
"A means of optimizing a moving target indicator (MTI) filter for rejecting several types of clutter, which are generated by different mechanisms such as by rain or the ground, is formulated. lt is found that the optimal performance of such a filter depends on the spectral density functions, average radar cross sections, and the relative mean Doppler frequencies of each type of clutter. lt is shown that the optimal improvement factor of such a filter is bounded by the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the radar cross sections of the clutter types) of the improvement factor for the individual clutter type. lt is also shown that the improvement factor of such a filter is a function of the relative mean Doppler frequency f0 between the clutter types. As f0 increases, the performance of the MTI system degrades. The worst improvement factor occurs when f0 is equal to half of the radar pulse-repetition frequency (PRF)."
"A model is developed for the Kalman tracker to account for stationary trajectory perturbations of a target navigating along a nominal straight-line path. This model is thought to be representative of a certain class of targets and is appropriate for long tracking times associated with surveillance/reconnaissance-type missions. In its simplest form, the model only requires one additional variable in the state equations and is completely characterized by the variance and correlation coefficient of the process."

 "A method for designing suboptimal minimal time controllers for linear, time-invariant regulator systems is presented. An economical closed-loop controller is obtained by using Lyapunov surfaces, corresponding to a quadratic Lyapunov function, as a continuous approximation for isochronal surfaces. Systems employing this controller are obtained by minimization, with respect to parameters of the quadratic Lyapunov function, of the worst case upper bound on the arrival time of an arbitrary initial state at the origin."
"There is a growing need for the scientist, engineer, and administrator to better understand the kinds of overall, across-the-board planning problems involved in the development of off-shore coastal areas. A recommended approach is to use systems analysis techniques. Principles will be set forth on maintaining and improving the quality of the ocean environment, with considerations of cost in so doing. Each proponent of an aspect of ocean technology usually believes that his field must be greatly enlarged in the near future. Along with these advances there is the likelihood of unnecessary social costs emanating from undesirable modifications of the environment. In making the analysis, an early step is to identify specific needs and appropriate roles. A next step is to lay out alternatives for achieving objectives both within a given organization and external to it. The alternatives may be appraised through their costs and benefits. But how do you make choices between goals when resources are limited? How can we gather the data, accomplish the evaluation, and do the planning that will make rational choices possible? This paper elucidates the problems involved in these kinds of questions and suggests methodology that might lead toward solutions."
"The radar use of coherent burst waveforms to obtain clutter suppression is summarized and problems arising from the high power implementation of such waveforms are discussed. These problems arise from the nonlinear nature of the typical high power radar transmitter and result in loss of subpulse-to-subpulse amplitude and phase accuracies, causing clutter suppression degradation. adaptive control loop used to measure transmission errors and provide continuous updating to minimize such errors is proposed. Residual transmission errors resulting via use of the control loop are calculated and shown to have an insignificant effect upon the clutter suppression properties of the coherent waveform. Experimental verification of control loop performance is presented."
"In many space communications applications, the intermodulation between carriers, due to limiting in a common amplifier, reduces the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the signal received at the ground station. By selectively spacing the carriers, one is often able to avoid the strong or low-order intermodulation. The question arises how much improvement is gained in carrier-to-interference ratio and signal-to-interference ratio by selectively spacing carriers such that low-order cross products are avoided or their impact is effectively reduced. The following analysis investigates interference improvement due to selective carrier spacing for several spacing sequences relative to equal carrier spacing. It is shown that the intermodulation noise reduction depends on the carrier packing density of the selected spacing sequence. The carrier-to-intermodulation noise ratio increases with the number of participating carriers, while the bandwidth efficiency decreases. The signal-to-intermodulation noise ratio improves not only because of the improved carrier-to-intermodulation noise ratio, but also because the remaining interference components have spectra with larger frequency spreading."
"A scheme to provide redundant sensor data in an automatic control system using the principle of functional redundancy is described. Normally there are three redundant radar altimeters used in the terminal phase of automatic landing of jet transport airplanes. This scheme replaces one of these altimeters with a data processing scheme based on a Kalman filter. The filter is driven by altitude rate and acceleration signals from the air data computer and vertical accelerometer. A special initialization technique employs the two altimeter signals. The feasibility of this scheme is indicated by tests in which data obtained from these several sensors during flight tests are used to drive the functionally redundant altimeter."
"Optimal control techniques have been applied to the problem of conserving fuel in C-141A aircraft. Numberical results form the basis for designing an on-board energy management system, which can automatically command fuel-optimal climb, cruise, and descent flight paths for a majority of this aircraft's missions."
"The closed-form solution of the equations of motion of an ideal missile pursuing a nonmaneuvering target according to the true propotional navigation law is obtained. An analysis of the solution is performed, and the conditions necessary for the missile to reach the target are determined."
"Dynamic interaction of wind-turbine-driven generators on electric utility networks was studied by computer simulation. Nonlinear representations of wind-turbine and various drive train elements and Park equation representations of synchronous and induction generators were implemented. An infinite capacity network was assumed. Time history responses for various system configurations were computed using as the input function severe wind gust data added to cyclical torque variations occurring at turbine blade frequency. Results indicated that severe transient mechanical and electrical stresses can be induced for certain system configurations. Best results were obtained by interposing rate or damped compliant couplings between the wind turbine and a synchronous generator. The induction generator did not appear to require such means. Blade pitch control (or equivalent) was required to limit output above rated wind velocities for wind turbines configured to produce maximum mum specific power. The blade pitch control loop must exhibit high performance to limit transient overshoots. An aerodynamically limited turbine driving an induction generator exhibited good response without the need for blade pitch control, but at the cost of increased turbine rotor diameter. Further work is indicated, taking into account wind-turbine aeroelastic effects, finite capacity networks, and other factors."
"The sidelobe suppression and improved sidelobe suppression mode performance of terminal and enroute air traffic control radar beacon systems using the existing antenna and a typical improved antenna in the presence of perfectly dielectric flat ground are investigated theoretically. Necessary analytical expressions for various quantities characterizing the system performance have been derived. A general purpose computer program has been developed for the computation and tabulation of these quantities as functions of the elevation angle of the observation point and for different combinations of heights of the directional and omnidirectional antennas of the beacon. Although the discussions given here apply to some specific antenna configurations, the theoretical method developed has more general application in evaluating quantitatively the performance of the beacon system in a given situation."
"The performance of a wide band frequency divider in the presence of additive Gaussian noise is presented. It is shown that the same theoretical signal to noise ratio improvement is attainable in this case as in the case where the spurious signal is a sine wave."
"The limiting performance of the generalized sign test detector as the number M of target returns becomes infinite has been derived by Hansen and Olsen [1]. Simple expressions are derived herein for the limiting performance for finite M as K, the number of noise samples in the reference set, becomes infinite. Curves are presented which indicate how this limiting performance is approached as K is increased for both constant target returns and fluctuating target returns."
"A set of guidelines is presented for correctly deriving the motion equations for a space vehicle by using the basic law of kinematics."
"The characteristics of optimum compensators for bandpass non-linearities are described. A predistortion compensator to reduce the nonlinear phase and envelope distortion at the output of a traveling-wave tube (TWT) is developed, and a possible implementation as a simple network of power law devices in cascade with the input to the TWT is given. The overall compensated characteristic of the TWT approximates that of a piecewise linear limiter with a small phase shift. A computer simulation shows that the compensated system yields 0.3 to 0.5-dB improvement in performance of a 2-phase coherent phase shift keying (CPSK) system over the uncompensated system."
"Using the Lyapunov approach, the conditions are presented for the stability of the spin axis of a 2-degree-of-freedom gyro which is mounted in a spinning vehicle."
"The presence of an interferring signal i(t) in a binary coherent symmetric channel is investigated. The probability of error is maximum when i(t) is antipodal to the transmitted signal, so(t) or s1 (t). The error probability is derived in the presence of a delayed interfering signal - so (t - r), where r is the time delay. An example of phase shift keying signals is given."
"The loss in output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to amplitude limiting is obtained for a radar circuit consisting of a bandpass limiter, coherent demodulator, matched filter, and moving-target-indicator (MTI) filter. The circuit is used in scanning MTI radars. The tandem connection of the limiter and coherent demodulator is a model for the saturation of the intermediate-frequency (IF) demodulator of an MTI radar. Results on special functions are used to obtain simple formulas for the loss in output SNR relative to a linear IF demodulator when the input SNR is less than -15 dB and the number of hits per 3-dB beamwidth exceeds 15."
"Problems involving kinematics of a counterweapon intercepting an attacking missile are well known. However, when the attacker's target, the counterweapon's launch platform, is moving, the problem generally becomes amenable only to trajectory simulation. Such may be the case in defense against torpedo attack against a ship and other situations involving the use of antimissile missiles. This paper derives the kinematic relations among the three bodies (missile, target, and counterweapon) in closed form under the asymptotic approximation of constant-bearing trajectories (collision courses). It is shown that the defending target, even if moving, can still determine the optimum course for its counterweapon when range and speed of the attacking vehicle are unknown. A simple relation is derived for the ratio between the attacker-target range (and time to impact) at counterweapon launch and the range at interception of the attacker by the counterweapon. Normalized curves are presented for some representative cases of defense by a counterweapon of known speed against a torpedo or missile attack on a moving target. The equations are shown to reduce to the familiar form for a stationary target."

 "This investigation considers the problem of the nonpreemptive scheduling of a set of independent periodic jobs in a computer system characterized by a collection of processors, memories, and interconnection mechanisms. Such a collection of resources can be used to perform the functions of a process control environment as are found, for example, in the avionics of a military or commercial aircraft. The distribution of these resources permits weight, volume, power, cost, and reliability requirements to be satisfied. Each periodic job is characterized by its frequency and its execution time. The inverse of the frequency, the period, is assumed to be an integer, and the initiation time and the completion time of job must be strictly met. An optimal algorithm is developed for a job set whose members are related by a binary frequency distribution. That is, if the jobs in the set are ordered in terms of decreasing job execution frequency, then fi = 2fi+1. The optimal result is generalized to include conditions in which the jobs are related by fi = kfi+1, where k is an integer."
"A new method is developed for determining the threshold carrier-to-noise ratio of a phase locked demodulator based on the notion of the quasi-linearization technique. Simple relations showing the dependence of the threshold carrier-to-noise ratio on the modulation index of the frequency modulated wave are given."
"A method based upon the quasi-linearization technique of evaluating the pull-in characteristics of a phase locked loop for an angle modulated signal corrupted with Gaussian noise is presented. Experimental results along with formulas for calculating the locking range and locking time are also presented and they are in good agreement with the theoretical results. Some new findings regarding the dependence of the locking range and locking time on the modulating frequency are also incorporated."
"It is shown that weather radar signal averaging causes a broadened apparent pattern of the scanning radar antenna. The apparent pattern is obtained by convolving the original pattern with the averaging circuit impulse response. Echo displacement and pattern broadness are examined for square law, linear, and logarithmic detectors having exponential and finite time integrators."
"A data-aided carrier reconstruction method is described for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) data communications over narrow-band transmission channels. Previous analyses of this problem have assumed an \"infinite\" bandwidth of the communication link, so that negligible intersymbol interference (ISI) resulted. On the contrary, when ISI takes place, a different structure must be used which operates on sampled data. The performance of this structure is expressed analytically as a function of 1) the statistics of the message symbols, 2) the characteristics of the channel, and 3) the parameters of the tracking system. Excellent agreement has been found between the theory and the results of a computer simulation."
"An analysis of the effects of thermal noise on the accuracy of direction finding (DF) monopulse systems which employ logarithmic amplifiers is presented. Numerical results are presented which indicate that a simple model may be used to compute rms thermal errors for a wide range of signal levels. Analytical results obtained in the limit of large signal-to-noise ratios are compared with standard results used to analyze monopulse systems employing automatic gain control (AGC) circuitry instead of log amplifiers."
"A formula is given that enables accurate values of the cumulative noncentral F distribution to be calculated. Since it does not seem to be generally known that constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection problems are concerned with evaluating the noncentral F distribution, results using the algorithm are compared with published values obtained using a CFAR algorithm. Both engineers and statisticians are therefore encouraged to consult each other's publications for useful (though maybe disguised) material."
"The most elementary type of rotor for the polyphase induction machine is the solid-iron rotor, which offers advantages in ease of manufacture, in high torque per ampere at standstill, in withstanding high rotational stresses, and in operating in unusual environments. Since conventional induction machine theory has proven inadequate for such machines, the need has arisen for improved methods of investigation. It is the purpose of this paper to present an approximate three-dimensional nonlinear numerical analysis for the solid-rotor induction motor, based on magnetostatic assumptions and finite-difference iterative techniques."
"A method for measuring the time of arrival of very narrow laser pulses which have been reflected and randomly broadened by a target is examined. It is known that these return pulses from the target have very small rise times. A threshold detection algorithm that detects the rising edge of the pulse is used for obtaining the pulse arrival times. The errors of the scheme are evaluated numerically for different pulse shapes, and a loose bound on the errors of detecting a typical pulse is obtained. Finally, a gamma-density model is used to characterize the random gain processes of the optical receiver, and the effect of such random gains on the errors of threshold detection is analyzed."
"The dominant complex natural resonances of radar targets are obtained via Prony's method applied to calculated and measured back-scattered ramp response waveforms. Subject targets are spheres, simple wire models of straight and swept wing aircraft, and realistic models of modern fighter aircraft. It is demonstrated that when the backscattered ramp response waveforms are obtained via Fourier synthesis of limited spectral range harmonic scattering data, some resonance locations at variance with those obtained from reaction integral equation search procedures are obtained. It is also shown, however, that the Prony deduced resonances can be used successfully in predictor-correlator target discrimination."
"Updated and expanded range instrumentation installations require a system capable of actually tracking and controlling large numbers of vehicles over expanded areas. A range instrumentation system is discussed based on distance measurement equipment (DME) coupled with high performance data links which satisfies these requirements. Previously developed DME systems utilized a single frequency data link, required a low sample rate, and accomodated only a few vehicles. The DME range instrumentation system described will handle a large number of test vehicles and accomodate high data rates without performance degradation. This is accomplished by incorporating surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and microprocessors with previous developed technology. A system performance analysis for various configurations of the range instrumentations system design is also presented."

"Detection performance in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is obtained for three specific problems involving either signal or noise source location uncertainty. The array processors are optimum in the sense that they form the likelihood ratio of the outputs of the individual array elements. Performance trade-offs due to signal uncertainty, signal and noise source location uncertainty, and array size are presented."
"The effects of multiplier offset voltages in adaptive arrays are examined. Multiplier offset voltages arise when active circuits are used to implement the error-by-signal multipliers required in an array based on the LMS algorithm. These offset voltages are known from experimental work to have a strong effect on array performance. It is first shown how multiplier offset voltages may be included in the differential equations for the array weights. Then their effect on weight behavior is studied. It is found that the offset voltages affect the final values of the weights, but not the time constants. Furthermore, the effect they have is influenced by the amount of element noise in the array. An adequate amount of noise is necessary to minimize weight errors due to offset voltages. An example is treated to show the effect of offset voltages on the final array weights and the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). With offset voltages present, it is found that there is a maximum SNR that can be obtained from the array. A specific input SNR is required to obtain this maximum output SNR. Finally, it is shown that a finite operating range for the weights places a further restriction on the acceptable values of offset voltages and noise."
"The phase-locked loop behavior is analyzed following the quasilinearization Booton's method. When the loop is locked on an unmodulated input signal with a static phase error, the phase detector nonlinearity produces an interaction between the static phase error and the voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) noise phase fluctuations. Formulas allowing one to compute the static phase error increase and the VCO phase variance increase are derived. When the input signal is phase modulated, there is an interaction between the static phase error, the VCO noise phase fluctuations, and the input signal phase modulation. Formulas are obtained that allow one to compute the loop loss of performances (static phase error increase and VCO phase variance increase) and the coherent phase demodulator output signal-to-noise ratio decrease. Finally, a slight modification to Booton's procedure is proposed, leading to results in better agreement with experimental data."
"A linear array of hydrophones is considered for detecting a signal echo from a stationary target in the presence of reverberation. The structure of the optimum (likelihood ratio) detector is compared with that of a beamformer-matched filter detector. The conditions causing an increase in the spatial noise correlation between two hydrophones are the conditions under which the optimum spatial detector performs significantly better than the beamforming detector. A study of the space-time correlation function of reverberation shows that 1) a decrease in scatterer angular spread (or a narrowing of the receiver directivity pattern) tends to increase the spatial correlation, 2) if the scatterer Doppler spread is much less than the signal carrier frequency and if the angular spread is uniform, it is still possible to get a high correlation if the intersensor distance is much smaller than the carrier wavelength. These conditions indicate situations where optimum techniques may be worthwhile."
 "The problem of quantization and saturation noise introduced by the process of analog-to-digital conversion is addressed. Analog-to-digital converters (ADC) with even versus odd numbers of output states are compared. Expressions are derived and evaluated which yield the signal-to-noise ratio and the gain versus signal level input when the input signal has an assumed Gaussian probability density. The results presented should have application in all fields in which digital signal processing is performed."
 "In data transmission systems using electromagnetic propagation there is often interest in the antijam capability of the system and the probability that the transmitted signal can be intercepted. It is shown that, neglecting antenna gain, both of these are adequately described by the processor gain. An information theoretic bound is given for the processor gain and the performance of several conventional signaling systems is indicated. Improvement using forward error correction is also investigated."

 "The backscattering of an elliptically polarized plane wave from two kinds of complex radar objects is considered from the standpoint of coherency theory, and the antenna polarizations that give rise to maximum correlated and uncorrelated orthogonally polarized components in the receiving channels are discussed. The resulting observations may find application in radar systems which use the correlation between the received orthogonally polarized components for detecting targets in natural and man-made interference."

"The mathematical analysis of a single-phase inductor alternator presented here asserts that rotor slot restrictions apply only for alternators with conventional double winding. Schemes using single winding for both dc excitation and single-phase output are developed and their designs are discussed. It is demonstrated that the proposed schemes are superior in performance to conventional schemes. Test results on a number of laboratory size machines fully support the theoretical findings."
"The application of 4-bit microprocessors to the communication of the control and status signals found in an advanced aircraft instrument landing system is presented. The advantages as well as some of the peculiarities of such an approach are described. Among the benefits, one must include the possibility of a very convenient and understandable human interface."
"State-plane analysis techniques are employed to study the voltage stepup energy-storage dc-to-dc converter. Within this framework, an example converter operating under the influence of a constant on-time and a constant frequency controller is examined. Qualitative insight gained through this approach is used to develop a conceptual free-running control law for the voltage stepup converter which can achieve steady-state operation in one on/off cycle of control. Digital computer simulation data are presented to illustrate and verify the theoretical discussions presented."
"Assuming a sinusoidal signal superimposed on a narrow-band Gaussian noise as the input to a receiving array, the output power and signal-to-noise ratio of a digital beamformer with postfiltering were formulated so that subsequent calculations could be made without an analysis in the frequency domain. The formulation utilized the quantizer functions previously given by the author and certain spectral power distribution factors originally attributed to Davenport but more rigorously derived and discussed in the present work. A numerical study based on this formulation for a DIMUS array in a correlated noise field reveals that except for certain rare circumstances, postfiltering generally improves the output SNR or array gain. It is demonstrated that the amount of postfiltering gain not only varies with array input SNR but also depends strongly upon the spacing-to-wavelength ratio, and its meaningful interpretation can only be made in conjunction with both the clipping and noise correlation losses. In particular, balancing postfiltering gain against the two losses suggests that receiving arrays with element spacings smaller than one-half of the operating wavelength may be used to the advantage of system design under certain conditions."
"A method is shown for suppressing the adaptive switching transient that arises in complex adaptive (LMS and stochastic approximation) algorithms due to signal normalization with controlled switched gains. The method involves rescaling of the adaptive weights with the normalizing gains just prior to the first adaptation with the new gains. In addition, an effective method of rescaling the adaptive gain factor based on the maximum eigenvalues of the respective covariance matrices is shown."
"Radar detection in Weibull clutter is examined from a statistical detection viewpoint. Weibull clutter parameters are determined and related to measured values of land and sea clutter. Optimum performance in Weibull clutter is determined, and practical receivers that approach this performance are identified. Receiver performance in Rayleigh, log-normal, and Weibull clutter is evaluated and compared."
"A systematic approach for the determination of failure thresholds for hybrid navigation systems is described. Cost functions which reflect the importance assigned to the consequences of false and missed alarms are minimized. The false alarm probability is obtained as a function of the threshold magnitude by observing the statistical behavior of the instrument outputs in the normal operating mode. The missed alarm probability is obtained by determining the sensitivity of navigation error performance to instrument error sources. Two cost functions are considered. To illustrate this method, failure detection and identification (FDI) thresholds are determined for the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Test flight."
"The history of range instrumentation radars begins at the end of World War 11, with the SCR-584 radar. Since then, the use of instrumentation radars on ranges all over the globe has expanded greatly to gather metric performance data on aircraft, projectiles, missiles, and satellites. In this paper, key subsystem-level and system-level developments during the past decade are reviewed, including pulse-Doppler, digital range systems, calibration techniques, computer usage, and dualfrequency systems. Recently developed instrumentation radars from domestic and foreign sources are described as are three unique high-power large-aperture systems used for satellite and ballisticmissile measurements. The paper concludes by examining the likely requirements for instrumentation radars of the future."
"The nonlinear set of equations which represent helicopter motion is linearized about a prescribed nominal state. Once the linearized system is obtained it is validated by comparing the output of the nonlinear system to that of its linearized counterpart. Having obtained a linear model, linear system theory may then be applied in order to investigate the stability and control characteristics of the aircraft."
 "The use of a simple digital first-order recursive filter for mean-level detection is described. Performance characteristics are derived for the case where the background noise is stationary, and detection results are given for Swerling Case 2 fluctuating signals. Equations are derived for computing false-alarm performance in nonstationary backgrounds, and results are given for some special cases. Comparisons are made with performance of a conventional mean-level circuit in stationary and nonstationary noise."
"In the above paper1 a technique was proposed to derive an upper bound on the error probability of a decision feedback equalizer. It involves decomposition of the probability density function of residual intersymbol interference and derivation of Chebyshev-type bounds on the error functionals over the decomposed functions. In this correspondence, we demonstrate that the technique is not applicable in general. The result is not a bound in many cases."
"Expressions for moving target indicator (MTI) improvement factor limitation due to pulse repetition frequency (PRF) staggering and loss of target detectability for various values of Doppler frequency in the passband are presented. It is also shown that the product of variance of stagger periods and clutter variance is an important parameter determining the performance of a staggered PRF MTI radar."
"The behavior of a second-order phase-locked loop (PLL) in the presence of an interfering signal has been analyzed by different authors with different results. The discrepancy is attributed to the presence or absence of an automatic gain controlled amplifier preceeding the PLL. Simulation results verify that the presence of the automatic gain controlled amplifier reduces the tendency of the PLL to break lock from the desired signal in favor of the interfering signal"
"An effective technique for removing range ambiguities (detections at ranges other than the true range of the object) arising when using a burst waveform is to transmit two bursts with different pulse repetition frequencies nearly simultaneously and then to process their outputs nonlinearly. This correspondence introduces two nonlinear processors which combine coincidence detection with either noncoherent multiplication or integration. It is shown that the combined false alarm and ambiguity removal performance of these nonlinear processors is superior to the performance of coincidence detection, noncoherent multiplication, or noncoherent integration when used separately."
"A method for accurately calculating the radar range improvement introduced by frequency agility is presented. This calculation is made by using the concept of independent pulses. The number of independent target or clutter pulses is calculated by a simple method based on such basic combinatorial probability theory as drawing differently colored balls from an urn."
"A method is proposed for computing sliding window detection probabilities which have applications in track-while-scan acquisition logic and radar detection theory. The sliding window probability is the probability of achieving m successes out of n consecutive events at least once by the Nth opportunity. Expressions are derived for these probabilities as a function of N and p (the per-event success probability) for 1 ⩽ n ⩽ 4 and m ⩽ n. Tabulated results are presented for the mean and standard deviation of the detection delay associated with each m/n logic."
"It is demonstrated here that inertial differentiation of angular momentum-is independent of the choice of the moving reference coordinate system.

"A mathematical multipath model of the flow of information within the afferent limb of the myotatic stretch reflex is reviewed and evaluated, with emphasis being placed on its multi-channel structure. The system is simulated, and the resultant output (alpha motoneuron transmembrane potential) is analyzed spectrally, with one single-tone input (muscle stretch) and a set of variations of different system parameters: (i) When all the channels are identical, the characteristics of the input signal are unrecognizable at the output, and can only be extracted by an ``unphysiological'' motoneuron. (ii) When the afferent conduction delays are distributed among the channels, the output is similarly distorted, and can only be improved by assuming an atypically long conduction path. (iii) When the muscle spindle firing thresholds are either varied among the channels or vary temporally within each channel, the distortion is dramatically reduced and the input signal is easily recoverable."

"A simple electrical model of the nerve axon is presented. The only non-linear element in the model is the sodium conductance, which is assumed to vary in a step-like way. This allows the propagation velocity for action potentials to be expressed analytically. The aftereffects from an action potential are generally slow. By considering them quasi-stationary, the velocity of a subsequent action potential can be calculated and compared with that of the first one. Considering the effects of afterpotential and afterconductance, it is shown that the theory adequately describes the variations in propagation velocity in the squid giant axon for action potentials separated by 3 ms to 14 ms."
"The direct closed head impact problem was idealized as a fluid-filled cylinder attached to a spring-dashpot element striking a rigid wall. The rigid cylinder represents the skull, the fluid denotes the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the lumped spring-dashpot element simulates the composite elastic and dissipative properties of the helmet, hair, skin, skull and the real wall. This paper concerns the inverse problem, i.e., what material and inertial properties should the helmet or padding have to afford optimal protection in a direct closed head impact? The answer was found in terms of 4 dimensionless ratios: (1) the brain to skull mass, (2) the skull to closed brain stiffness, (3) the damping factor of the skull, and (4) the impact speed of the cylinder to the brain wave speed. The solution to the problem was achieved through hybrid computation using as the Index of Performance the time averaged pressure at contrecoup beyond the cavitation pressure of the fluid. Given a set of impact and system parameters, the optimal choice consists of making the value of the stiffness ratio as small as possible and still completely compressing the spring. Then, for a given mass ratio, the optimum damping ratio is found from a simple graph."
"This new multi-compartment model for secretion, distribution, binding, and metabolism of cortisol is capable of simulating the rapid fluctuations in plasma cortisol concentration observed in normal people during the early morning hours. In addition to the well- established principles of cortisol secretion, binding to plasma proteins, distribution, and metabolic clearance, the proposed model defines the presence of different cortisol binding sites in cells, as well as the complex adrenal response to changing blood levels of the pituitary hormone, ACTH. By incorporating these physiological principles into the model, a more detailed and accurate simulation of cortisol dynamics has been achieved."
"Fibrillation thresholds and safe leakage current levels are being reexamined and new values of safe current other than the 10 μA are being considered. Values of fibrillation and pump failure thresholds are presented and related to surface area. The surface areas covered range from those found in dye injection and other exploratory catheters (0.224 mm2) to the largest endocardial pacing catheter (90 mm2). The results indicate that to choose or set a safe current level without regard to surface area or based on one surface area is unrealistic."
"The displacement cardiograph (DCG) is a non-contacting electromagnetic instrument for the recording of heart movement. Its field penetrates deep into the body and is extremely sensitive thereby allowing the recording of myocardial movement from patients regardless of body shape or posture even by paramedical personnel. A summary of recordings from normal subjects, patients and animals is described here showing the DCG's flexibility as a diagnostic tool and as a device for basic physiological studies into the kinetics of organs."
"A laser thermal stimulator system is described which enables the psychophysical and neurophysiological study of cutaneous thermal and pain sensations by means of a non-contact, precise stimulator. A carbon dioxide laser is used as the heat source with closed loop control of skin temperature via a sophisticated radiometer. Temperature steps of 0.1°C to 25°C have been achieved with rise rates of greater than 30°C/second. The temperature can be maintained to better than ±0.1°C over pulse durations of 0.3 seconds to 20 seconds."
"The transmitted field strengths in homogeneous spherical models of human and animal heads are determined as a function of time and position, using frequency analytic techniques for an impinging pulse of Gaussian character. A relaxation process and constant conductivity are assumed for the electrical behavior of brain matter. The constant conductivity process predicts continued decrease in pulse amplitude as it advances in the head starting from the leading surface; however, the relaxation process predicts reduction only from the surface to the center. Moreover, it appears that the transmitted pulse in a spherical model of the head is always related to the time derivative of the incident radiation. Numerical results indicate that the transmitted pulse amplitude is quite small and can be estimated using the constant conductivity model."
"An instrument for computing correlograms of neuronal spike trains is described. The special purpose nature of the instrument permits sufficient computation speed to allow real-time display of compiling correlograms. Such capability greatly extends the user's observation power during the important phase of data collection from multiple neural units. Due to its modular design, other useful statistical analysis programs (PST, Interval histograms) can be easily designed and incorporated."
"Inhomogeneities in magnetic field density are not very critical in pulsating arterial flow, but may be an important consideration in venous flow and branch or asymmetric flow. In this regard, a blood flow probe design has been developed with a magnetic field distribution which varies less than 1% across the lumen. It is shown that the luminal fields of two commercially available probes vary as much as 25%."

"This communication reports a new mathematical and analog computation of in vivo or extracellular fluid (ECF) base excess (BEe) of man derived from blood pH and PCO<L>2<L>. BEe is defined here as BE of blood diluted fourfold with extracellular fluid, as estimated by reading Siggaard-Andersen's alignment nomogram at 3 gm hemoglobin (Hb). An equation for his nomogram, which can be solved analogically but not analytically, is: BEe = 0.61 × 10<sup>&#x003C0;</sup> - 24.4 - 3.8 (1.2 - &#x003C0;)+ where &#x003C0; = log P<sub>CO2</sub> + f(pH - 7.4), and f = &#x00394; log P<sub>CO2</sub>/&#x00394;pH, a function of Hb and BE. At Hb = 3, f = 11.5/(BEe + 37.5) + 0.95. \"+\" indicates that negative values of the final term are counted zero. The multiplier \"f\" is generated in a FET in which source-drain resistance is a hyperbolic function of gate voltage, controlled by feedback from the computed BEe. The &#x003C0; summing amplifier drives both an antilog circuit to obtain 10<sup>&#x003C0;</sup> and, through a diode, a linear subtraction of the final term, which applies only when -30 <BE <-15. The analog solution tracks the nomogram within ±0.5 mEq/l. An intermediate solution of plasma HCO<sub>3</sub> - is obtained by setting f = 1.044 and dropping the two final terms."

"Computer generated binary matched filters have been used in an attempt to recognize and count immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) on a standard blood smear slide in a coherent optical data processing system. The Fourier plane binary filters were synthesized on a digital computer using an appropriate polar geometry mathematical model. Various filters were constructed and tested for synthetic blood cells, and preliminary test results are presented for random samples of actual blood slides. These show a trend of manual reticulocyte count versus the matched filter count, but no statistical significance."
"We sought to minimize silver-silver chloride electrode impedance by chemical treatment. Chloriding pure silver electrodes lowered the impedance, as noted by Geddes [1]. Immersing the chlorided electrodes in photographic developer lowered the impedance further, as noted by Marmont [2]. A second layer of silver chloride did not result in any further reduction in impedance, as hypothesized."

"Controllability, observability and structural identifiability of biological compartmental systems of any structure are studied in order to evaluate the significance of a multi input-multi output experiment, that is, the a priori possibility of estimating the unknown system parameters through the chosen experiment."
"Measurement of the colorectal myoelectrical activity in humans has revealed three basic patterns of behavior, comprising a lower frequency oscillation of about 0.05 Hz, a higher frequency of about 0.12 Hz and periods of zero activity. To simulate these myoelectrical patterns, the concept of linked relaxation oscillators is extended in this paper using three different mathematical model structures. In the three models two of the activity patterns are obtained as two stable limit cycle solutions produced by symmetrically coupling together two relaxation oscillators. The first model comprises a ring of interconnected oscillators which produces a third stable solution representing the higher frequency of oscillation. Summation of adjacent oscillator outputs reproduces the zero activity when the oscillators are in antiphase. By addition of an extra coefficient into the basic relaxation oscillator equation for the second model, the zero state becomes a stable condition and the three patterns are obtained without the necessity of a ring structure. The third model requires an in-situ change in a parameter value for the lower and higher frequencies to decay away to the zero activity condition."
"The author proposes an analysis of the continuous distribution of specific tidal volume throughout the lung which, to some extent, takes into account the dead space constituted by the bronchial tree."
"Two problems are considered which concern circular loop receiving aerials used in inductive loop telemetry. The first is that certain transmitter orientations give rise to signal nulls. The second is the optimum aerial size. By inverting the roles of the transmitting and receiving aerials, a simple way of describing the orientations which give rise to signal nulls is found. The factors which limit the range of an aerial are discussed and a simple method for deciding whether or not it is advantageous to enlarge or reduce the aerial radius is given."
"Radio frequency energizing of implanted transmitters presents an interesting possibility to make feasible comparative measurements from sites within the body over very long periods of time. Disturbances in the energy transport may, however, cause the implant carrier frequency to change, which is seen as artifacts or drift at the demodulator end. Here, this problem was solved by feeding back the demodulator output level to control the amplitude of the external energizing oscillator. The closed loop modifies the frequency characteristic of the transmitter-receiver system in a predictable way. The artifacts due to implant movements can be minimized by careful application and by analysis of the field characteristics inside and outside the energizing solenoid, thus positioning the implant adequately."
"A single quartz fiber delivery system capable of remotely depositing in excess of 9 watts of continuous laser radiation has been developed and tested. Of particular interest in this development was the achievement of a catheter that can be inserted into the biopsy channel of a conventional flexible endoscope for noninvasive control of gastric bleeding. In animal testing, the prototype device was found capable of producing a large useful area of superficial tissue coagulum, effectively controlling gastric hemorrhage. Future clinical application is highly encouraging."
"The design and operation of a new semiconductor element, based upon the field effect principle is discussed. The device, which is called an OSFET, can be used as a measuring electrode for bioelectric activity. The OSFET consists of an MOS-transistor configuration, where the gate metal has been omitted and can be used directly in the extracellular fluid as an active probe. The operation of the OSFET is described by a physical-mathematical model, by means of which it is possible to explain the results of electrophysiological measurements. These results are compared with the results of a computer simulation, in which the Rosenfalck equation for extracellular potential distributions serves as an input for the OSFET model stated. A special electronic circuit is used to perform low impedance measurements in a simple way with the OSFET electrode. It appears that extracellular potentials measured with an OSFET-electrode have an extended frequency range, with respect to conventional potential measurements (0 ⩽< f ⩽< 45 K c/s)."
"An auditory code capable of transducing two dimensional patterns and pictures for presentation to blind people has been developed. The image to be presented is detected by a television camera or other device and translated into the code by electronic circuits."
"The article describes a detector for physiological phenomena, e.g., the QRS-complex, having a trigger accuracy of 0.5 ms. The configuration to be recognized first is preprocessed then fed into a pair of amplifiers with adjustable gain and offset, representing the upper and lower contour-limit derived from the actual signal. These signals are sampled and A/D converted, then stored in two memories during the ``read''-operation."
"A device to provide automated measurement of the electromyographic silent period with real time capability utilizing a voltagetime window is described. This device is being used in the clinical dental diagnosis and treatment of functional disorders of the masticatory system. The design, performance, utilization, and other applications of this device are discussed."
"Two published models for the interaction of sympathetic and parasympathetic effects on heart rate are examined. The models appear to support contradictory conclusions: one was interpreted to imply no interaction, while the other one was said to indicate significant interaction between the two types of autonomic controls. It is shown that the two models are essentially equivalent, and that the different conclusions are due to different interpretations of the concept of interaction."
"A means of combining two older audiometric techniques to yield a totally automated determination of hearing threshold levels using an integral audiometer-digital microprocessor is discussed. The design of the audiometric computer is briefly outlined."
"A theoretical study of the distribution of the normalized heating potential resulting from a plane wave incident in a multilayered sphere simulating a human head with skin, fat, bone and brain tissue layers has been undertaken. It was found that for spheres of radii 10 cm and 5 cm a relative peak of the normalized heating potential occurs in the vicinity of the center of the sphere. For the case of the 5 cm sphere in the range of frequencies 400 MHZ to 2.76 GHZ the maximum value of the heating potential occurs at the center suggesting the possibility of a hot spot. A comparison between the multilayer and a single layer model shows that the maximum values of the heating potential are the same."
"Electromyographic power density spectra were computed for both uninsulated 75μ diameter and insulated 25μ diameter intramuscular biopolar electrodes. The results show that the smaller diameter electrodes yield spectra with significantly higher peak frequencies and broader bandwidths."
"The need for objective methods of patient evaluation has long been recognized in clinical psychiatry. While the relationship between mood states and motor activity has been observed for many years, this relationship was never accurately defined due to the imprecise nature of the available observational techniques. This report describes two activity sensors and their related systems which objectively measure motor activity levels and patterns without affecting the patient's movements."

 "The discovery of new stains for chromosome preparations has made useful automated chromosome analysis possible. Appropriate descriptors for use in this process must be found and tested. Data compression using integrated intensity and density profiles has already proven valuable."
"A model is developed for the vagal control of SA nodal activity in the heart and consists essentially of a modified Bonhoeffer-Van der Pol (BVP) model of the ``free-running'' SA node and a lumped model of the neural terminations in that region. The model is capable of mimicking both the driven transient behavior of the node in terms of pacemaker and inhibition curves, as well as steady-state entrainment phenomena. The model data also agree very well with experimental data from dog experiments performed in our laboratory. The model is described by a set of nonlinear, third-order, ordinary differential equations and provides a relatively uncomplicated functional model of heart period changes due to vagal stimulation patterns."
"A model for Rose Bengal transport through the hepatobiliary system has been developed, and non-linear programming techniques have been used to derive the model's parameters according to actual patient data. The model is then further analyzed as a Markov chain. A system of checks and balances, and measure of error, is discussed."
"An analytical expression has been obtained for the transient temperature distribution produced when the retina is irradiated by a high-intensity light source. The following factors are included in the analysis: (1) structurally the fundus consists of layers of material which have different physical properties, (2) absorption of energy from the light beam follows the Beer-Lambert law, (3) energy is absorbed in the sclera as well as in the pigment epithelium and choroid, (4) heat is removed from the fundus by blood circulating through the capillaries of the choroid, and (5) intensity of the light source may vary with time. Computed values indicate that absorption of energy in the sclera and removal of heat by convection are both important for longer irradiation times, which agrees with recent experimental observations. The asymptotic response to a train of pulses is presented also."
"After a pacemaker impulse passes along the atrioventricular conducting pathway of the heart, that tissue resists subsequent conduction for a time interval known as the ``effective refractory period.'' Effective refractory period (ERP) and transit time of conducted impulses vary in response to drug, hormonal and electrical influences and may be used as indicators of the immediate physiologic state of intracardiac conduction. The traditional manual technique for measurement of ERP and conduction time consists in repeatedly adjusting a pulse generator until conduction of a stimulus of minimum interval can be observed on a chart recorder or oscilloscope. In contrast to the slow, imprecise and tedious manual method, the automated system described here provides whole graphs of ERP and conduction times as functions of external pacing interval or intervals of induced premature beats with a minimum of operator intervention. Thus, atrioventricular conduction can be conveniently assessed by machine, while the human intellect is freed to dwell on the abstractions of interpreting results and controlling the overall measurement environment."
"A new decomposition technique useful for representing a set of observed electrocardiograms is presented. This decomposition is different from past techniques in the constraints placed on the component waveforms in that they must be positive and start, stop, and overlap in a prescribed manner. The number of component waveforms is dependent on the maximum error tolerated in the reconstruction of the observed waveforms from the component representation."
"Replacing the usual principle of conservation of numbers with the equivalent principle of continuity of flow leads to a very heuristic approach to modeling time lags in population dynamics. The approach allows the direct use of unequal time lags without the implicit assumption of a stable age distribution. It is directly applicable to certain endemic and epidemic diseases. Where time lags occur in the incubation or life cycle of the agent of such a disease, they often importantly affect the dynamics associated with the disease, yet they seldom are accounted for properly."
"This paper is an experimental extension of theoretical work previously published by one of the authors. Results of pacing a canine heart using four different increasing exponential and ramp-like waveforms are presented. It is shown that these waveforms reduce the cardiac threshold energy by as much as 14 percent when compared with a pure rectangular pulse shape and by about 21 percent when compared with a standard cardiac pacer pulse. It is also found that above threshold energy is reduced by 50-60 percent. These results offer promise of increasing the life of certain new pacer power sources currently being tested. In addition, it may now be possible to pace at lower energy levels, thereby reducing tissue damage near the stimulating electrode, without running as much of a risk of exit block as with a comparable rectangular pulse pacer."
"A digital method for imaging gamma-ray emitting organs recorded through a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) aperture is described. This technique can be used in an almost real-time recording and imaging system to yield quantitative and qualitative cross-section and depth information of the source. Furthermore, this method avoids some of the problems introduced by the usual method of optical reconstruction. Experimental results of the recording of a multiplane gamma-ray source and the reconstruction of digitally and optically formed images are also presented."
"This paper presents an approach to signal waveform analysis in the frequency range of 1 to 50 Hz. The technique is applicable to any waveform which is a single-valued function of time with continuous derivatives. The main application of this system has been on the human EEG. The analyzer, to be described, performs its analysis in the time domain and abstracts wave shape information from the original wave and from the successive mathematical derivatives of that wave. The output from this analyzer consists of six analog descriptors of the input EEG wave. These descriptors are basic amplitude and basic frequency of the original input wave, amplitude and frequency of the first derivative of the input wave, and amplitude and frequency of the second derivative of the input wave."
"With the successful implementation of a computer analog for (ß-cell function to restore normal glucose tolerance in diabetic patients, one of the major obstacles to the ultimate development of an implantable ``artificial pancreas'' was overcome. The next step was to optimize the original algorithm and simplify the operation of the blood sugar control system to make it more amenable to miniaturization."
"Partial body surface potential maps from both normal subjects and subjects with independently diagnosed myocardial infarcts are visually compared from superimposed plots. A correlation test is devised to distinguish the two groups, with the reference waveform determined by means of a gradient-search algorithm. The results are encouraging, and suggest further investigation of these techniques as a future diagnostic tool."
"Certain neuronal spike trains may be viewed as stochastic, nonhomogeneous point process. Neuronal information may be encoded in the time-varying mean rate of the spike train in some cases. For this purpose the simulator can be modulated by arbitrary time-varying voltage waveforms."

 "The success of chronic stimulation with implanted metal electrodes depends in part on an understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms controlling charge transfer across the metal-tissue interface. Time-and frequency-domain impedance behavior of metal electrodes are briefly reviewed, and a model of the physical structure of the interface and an equivalent circuit reflecting electrochemical mechanisms are outlined. Some theories dealing with the observed changes in electrode resistance and capacitance under various experimental conditions are described. Charge-transfer mechanisms at high stimulation intensities, including surface gas adsorption and desorption, are considered. The relation of electrode and tissue damage to faradaic and capacitive stimulus current components, and the relevance of this to stimulus waveforms and the underlying electrochemistry are discussed."
"Modern microelectronics technology makes possible implants which are both small and complex, provided the problems of encapsulation against the depredations of body fluid can be solved. This paper surveys some of the encapsulation procedures available, commenting on their range of application, and describes some of the experience of this Unit in the various technologies. Attention is drawn to the need to relieve residual tensile stresses in encapsulants when attempting to enclose implants in rigid but permeable cases. This paper concludes with some remarks on hermetic packages."
"Electrical stimulation of the visual cortex of the brain results in punctate photic sensations called ``phosphenes.'' This suggests the concept of producing artificial vision for the blind by implanting arrays of electrodes, producing scoreboard-like displays. Electrical stimulation of the cochlea, VIIIth nerve, and auditory cortex produces analogous auditory sensations called ``audenes,'' which might be used to provide artificial hearing for the deaf."
"A stereotaxic method for placement of electrodes in the human brain is described. Radiographic visualization of subcortical targets are discussed and error correction formulas are developed. Electrodes and fixation methods for long-term human implantation are described. Multiple stainless steel or silver bail electrodes have been implanted in 75 patients with schizophrenia, epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, narcolepsy, and intractable pain. The silver ball electrode is more satisfactory for recording and stimulation. Biphasic 0.25-ms duration currents from 2-7 mA have been applied to animals and humans without evidence of structural damage."
"Three areas of the brain have been used for stimulation to control chronic pain. Stimulation of the primary sensory relay nuclei of the thalamus (VPM, VPL) and internal capsule reduce pain by activating large nonpain sensory neurons which produce sensory paresthesias and inhibition of small pain fibers. The third area is the paraventricular gray matter-an area that apparently modulates pain input. Stimulation of this area reduces pain for hours with short periods of stimulation with little or no side effects. Chronic stimulation intermittently over a period of up to three years shows no tendency to tolerance, habitutation, electrode isolation, loss of effectiveness, or tissue destruction."
"A loaded probe technique was used to measure the current density distribution resulting from application of electrical current to the spinal cords of live anesthetized stumptail macaque monkeys and fresh human cadaver spinal cords via the electrode arrays of four commercially available spinal implant systems used for management of intractable pain."
"In recent years, electrical stimulation of the cerebellum has been used successfully to control epileptic seizure activity in man. This paper deals with the minimization of the energy transferred from a brain pacemaker to the cerebellum. Reducing this energy may reduce considerably the damage done to the brain tissue, and will probably prolong the life of an implanted power source used to energize such a pacer. Using an electrical model for stainless steel electrodes imbedded in brain tissue, it is shown theoretically that an exponentially increasing stimulating pulse can reduce the energy for inhibition of after-discharge activity by at least 30 percent compared to the corresponding quantity obtained for a rectangular waveform. Preliminary in vivo tests of this theory have been conducted in cats. Electrically induced after-discharge activity was obtained by stimulating the sensorymotor cortex. Three different waveshapes (rectangular, triangular, and exponentially increasing) were applied to the cerebellum, and the minimum energy required to inhibit the elicited after-discharge was found for various pulsewidths, repetition rates, and train lengths. The preliminary data indicate that nonrectangular waveforms require less energy than the rectangular waveshape to achieve threshold inhibition of after-discharge activity."
"Electrical currents were applied to the cerebellum of anesthetized monkeys using techniques similar to those employed in human cerebellar electrode implant systems. Alterations in the bloodbrain barrier were not observed. Histological damage, when present, appeared secondary to mechanical injury rather than to application of current. Measurement of current density in the monkey and human cerebellum indicated that with the electrode configuration employed, most of the current is retained in the vicinity of the electrodes. In human patients with spasticity and dyskinesia, application of current through implanted cerebellar electrode units relieves spasticity and also has been associated with reduction of somatosensory evoked potential amplitude. The amount of current required for clinical improvement and for alteration of evoked potential amplitude has remained stable in all patients, even those followed for more than a year. These observations suggest that the methods described do not produce appreciable cerebellar damage."
"Excellent models have been presented in the literature which relate membrane potential to transverse membrane current and which describe the propagation of action potentials along the axon, for both myelinated and nonmyelinated fibers. There is not, however, an adequate model for nerve excitation which allows one to compute the threshold of a nerve fiber for pulses of finite duration using electrodes that are not in direct contact with the fiber. This paper considers this problem and presents a model of the electrical properties of myelinated nerve which describes the time course of events following stimulus application up to the initiation of the action potential. The time-varying current and potential at all nodes can be computed from the model, and the strength-duration curve can be determined for arbitrary electrode geometries, although only the case of a monopolar electrode is considered in this paper. It is shown that even when the stimulus is a constant-current pulse, the membrane current at the nodes varies considerably with time. The strength-duration curve calculated from the model is consistent with previously published experimental data, and the model provides a quantitative relationship between threshold and fiber diameter which shows there is less selectivity among fibers of large diameter than those of small diameter."
"A simple mathematical model of a transcutaneous stimulating electrode molded from conductive elastomer is used to predict the current density pattern produced by such electrodes. A general method has been developed to determine experimentally the current distribution produced by this class of electrodes. Preliminary experimental results are qualitatively in agreement with predictions made from the model. The experimental method for the determination of current spread yields a valid assessment of electrode performance independent of the accuracy of the mathematical model."
"Transcutaneous neural stimulation is a relatively new method of pain control, the short- and long-term success of which has yet to be fully documented. In this study, electrical stimulus parameters and electrode locations were carefully monitored in 23 patients who received satisfactory relief of chronic pain with electrical stimulation. These patients were chosen from 100 patients treated with this modality on a trial basis. Analysis demonstrates that a large percentage of patients have good to excellent pain relief by employing electrical parameters within restricted ranges."
"Development of a solvent-activated current passing tape electrode system has improved significantly the clinical efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Developmental work with this electrode system in combination with solid-state battery-operated pulse generators has opened new and interesting areas of application, including pain relief, muscle stimulation, and use as an indifferent electrode."
"The behavior of spheroidal cells in an applied uniform field is examined in order to gain insight into the role of cell shape in the electrical activity of biological cells. The responses of cells having different eccentricities but the same height in the direction of stimulation are compared. The effect of a change in the direction of stimulation is discussed. In the process of obtaining the results an approximate method for calculating biopotentials during extracellular stimulation is presented and justified."
"A method for identification of time-locked deep brain potentials from the EEG is described. The analysis shows that the reciprocal of the frequency interval between ripples in the EEG power spectral density is proportional to the time between depth spikes."

"When the body of man, small compared to a wavelength, is exposed to high frequency (HF) electromagnetic (EM) fields, the absorbed power density patterns and total absorbed power may be approximated by the simple superposition of the internal electric fields obtained from the quasistatic coupling characteristics of the electric and magnetic field components determined independently. These characteristics were obtained for full scale man by thermographic studies of power absorption in scale models of man exposed to fields at frequencies scaled up inversely proportional to the model size. A VHF resonant cavity was used to provide the necessary field strengths for producing measurable power absorption patterns under simulated HF exposure conditions. The results indicate that peak power absorption densities as high as 5.63 W/kg can be produced in man exposed to 10 mW/cm2 31 MHz radiation fields. The results show that the absorption decreases as the square of the frequency as predicted by theory for frequencies below 31 MHz."
"A study has been made of the interaction of two crosspolarized plane electromagnetic waves with six-layered spherical models of a mammalian head. The numerical results indicate that the absorbed powers induced inside small animal and human heads by incident circularly polarized waves and linearly polarized waves are very similar except that the absorbed power in the planes transverse to the direction of propagation is uniform for the cross-polarized wave. It is also shown that the average absorbed power depends strongly on the frequency and head size involved. The maximum absorbed powers in a given size spherical head vary only slightly with frequency for the two frequencies studied. However, since a greater amount of the absorbed power occurs in the inner sphere representing the brain of a human head when 918 MHz rather than 2450 MHz is used, the former constitutes a greater health hazard to man at the same incident power."
"Using a criterion of minimization of total respiratory work during a complete respiratory cycle, an expression has been derived for prediction of the inhalation time/exhalation time ratio. Comparison of calculated results to experimental data is favorable. The expression also predicts a rectangular waveshape during exercise, and this result agrees well with experimental and theoretical findings previously published."
"A relation is derived between the transmitted spectral density and the output spectral density of broad bandwidth, random signal, Doppler flow measurement systems operating under conditions where the fluid transit time is limited by the transmitted signal bandwidth and not by beam geometry. The fact that this result is already known to hold for pulsed radio frequency (RF) Doppler proves that random or pseudorandom Dopplers will give the same output spectrum as pulsed RF Dopplers, provided that the transmitted spectral density of the RF system has the same envelope as that of the noise system."
"The induced fields, currents, and power absorbed by spherical models of humans or animals when exposed to extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields are calculated. Spherical models can be expected to provide values of the right order of magnitude. The induced fields are a sum of the quasistatic solutions for a sphere irradiated by a uniform electric and magnetic field. Calculations are provided for ELF fields emanating from the proposed Navy's Sanguine antenna and extra high voltage (EHV)/ultra high voltage (UHV) transmission lines proposed by the utility industry. The question of biological hazards from exposure to fields of these systems is also considered."
"A recently developed instrument, the photographic eye oximeter (PEO), has been used to make extensive measurements of retinal blood oxygen saturation in rabbits. A model for the reflection of light from the ocular fundus is developed to account for the experimental results. This model is based on the multiple scattering of photons by red blood cells (rbc's) and enables three components of detected light to be distinguished, the coherently transmitted, the diffusely scattered into the detector cone, and the diffusely scattered out of the detector cone. The small diameter of these vessels, the wavelength bands selected for measurement, the large total scattering cross section, and the sharply forward peaked scattering pattern of the red blood cells causes the detected signal from the fundus to be composed primarily of light that has diffusely traversed the vessel twice, reflecting from a background layer after a first traverse. The light is attenuated by a saturation dependent molecular absorption. Equations are derived to enable the blood oxygen saturation to be calculated from photometrically measured quantities. A theoretical calibration line for the PEO is calculated and is shown to be in very good agreement with the experimental line, especially at high saturations."
"A differential white blood cell classifier is described. The system, which is based upon a three-color flying spot-scanner approach, utilizes recognition parameters based on the principle of geometrical probability functions which are generated at high speed in a dedicated computer. The result is a pattern recognition system capable of performing a routine clinical differential cell count at the rate of 100 cells/40s on a traditionally prepared specimen. The Hematrak system was evaluated in a routine clinical laboratory which reported that reproducibility, normal cell recognition accuracy, and the detection of abnormality were at least comparable to the manual technique."
"This paper discusses the results of experiments carried out to determine the feasibility of using electrocutaneous stimulation in sensory substitution systems. The sharp, pricking pain often associated with electrocutaneous stimulation has been found to be a result of thermal damage to the corneal layer of the skin. The high-energy densities required to create this damage often occur, even at moderate stimulation currents, because of the highly nonhomogeneous nature of the skin-electrode interface. However, this pain can be controlled without resorting to electrode pastes by adopting a simple procedure for applying the electrode. The dynamic range and the stability of the sensation magnitude have been measured under paste-free conditions and the conclusion is reached that electrocutaneous stimulation would be a viable alternative to mechanical stimulation in certain sensory substitution applications."
"This communication describes a new technique in which penetrating microwave radiation is used for the diagnosis and monitoring of pathological cardiopulmonary conditions, such as pulmonary edema. Edema causes changes in the electromagnetic characteristics of the lung tissue, which in turn produces a change in the reflected and transmitted microwave radiation. Both the amplitude and phase changes of the microwave signals are measured."
"The feasibility of measuring the individual input impedance in each primary arterial input to intracranial structures was examined in the anesthetized dog. From a Fourier analysis of experimental pressures and flows, carotid and vertebral input impedances with the corresponding components of hydraulic power were computed, giving the anterior, posterior, and total cerebrovascular impedances."
"The steady flow of a fluid with constant viscosity through an elastic tube is modified to account for the radial viscosity variations observed in blood flow. It is assumed that a one-dimensional flow analysis holds locally and that the relationship between tube radius and transmural pressure is known."

"Collagen and other polyelectrolyte materials in a homogeneous, aqueous electrolyte are studied and modeled as a seat of electromechanical transduction. The frequency response of collagen membranes in a range of chemical environments shows how transduction with a deformable membrane coupled hydrodynamically to an external mechanical system can lead to a mechanical response resulting from an electrical stimulus and an electrical response to a mechanical excitation. Dynamic measurements, which can more easily distinguish between membrane and electrode phenomena, result in electromechanical coupling coefficients that show reciprocity and agree with values determined by stationary techniques. A model representing the membrane at the interfibrillar level by a system of cylindrical pores is developed relating externally measured potentials, membrane deformations, currents, and mass fluxes to equivalent pore radius, fibril diameter, and polyelectrolyte charge. Measured values of the membrane coupling coefficients are then used to infer average microstructural parameters of the membrane that compare favorably to available data based on electron microscopy."
"A mathematical model of the human temperature regulatory system which utilizes finite difference techniques and includes new anatomical and basal physiological information, with more detail than previous models, is presented. A cold stress control system which includes both a feedback signal based on head core temperature and feedforward signals based on the skin temperature and the skin heat flux is postulated. Model and direct experimental results (seven temperatures, cardiac output, metabolism, and arm blood flow) are compared for a transient cold exposure. The substantial agreement found suggests that the skin heat flux could be an important input to the temperature regulatory system."
"This paper extends previous modeling work in our laboratory on the simulation of the panting maneuver executed in a body plethysmograph [8] to the simulation of a wider range of pulmonary function tests and, in particular, the maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve. The simulation is implemented on an analog computer for ease of parameter manipulation; the effects of changes in several model parameters (such as large and small airway resistance, and airway and lung compliance) on the MEFV curve are discussed. The model structure presented here is much simpler than the ventilatory system models of Fry [6] and Pardaens et al. [18], and yet yields the same information in a diagnostic sense."
"Pressure and flow distributions are reported at different steady flows for four latex fusiform aneurysm models. The accuracy of results by pitot-static techniques is examined in terms of experimental evidence and theoretical considerations. Results indicate that pressure distributions are associated with the Reynolds number, the degree of wall divergence and the degree of dilation of the sac, and that these parameters are interactive. The Reynolds number was found to have some predictive value for pressure distribution in the aneurysm, but the Bernoulli principle, based on geometrical variation and laminar flow, was usually inapplicable. Also, disturbed flow (eddies, reversal, turbulence) can occur as functions of the interactive parameters."
"The ultrasonic volumetric scattering cross section of the erythrocyte has been measured over a range of frequencies by comparing the rms value of the gated backscattered signal from the blood with that of a wave reflected from a flat reflector with known reflection coefficient. It is found to be proportional to the fourth power of the frequency predicted by the wave scattering theory for small particles in the frequency range from 5 MHz to 15 MHz. The relation between the scattering coefficient and the hematocrit is also examined up to a hematocrit of 45 percent. This coefficient is found to increase along with the hematocrit until it reaches a maximum around hematocrit = 26 percent and then decreases as the hematocrit increases. Twersky's wave scattering theory is applied to describe this result."
"Several methods aimed at obtaining highly selective electromyographic recordings are studied in human muscle with a multi-electrode technique. It was found that a small electrode size had a major effect in obtaining selective recording. High-pass filtering of the signal resulted in a further increase in the amplitude ratio of action potentials generated by close and remote fibers due to different frequency content of the action potentials. Additional improvement in selectivity could be achieved by bipolar recording."
"Conventional electrodes that are used to measure oxygen tension in the biological environment have been plagued by one or more of three major problems: 1) flow sensitivity, 2) instability, and 3) inadequate response time. Pulsatile operation of the electrode has the potential of eliminating these problems. A new technique of measurement using integration of output current has been developed. This new method of measurement enhances the pulsatile operation in the Po2 electrode. The technique effectively determines the difference in charge transport that occurs during the polarization potential. Using this technique, it has been possible to measure net charge transport, which is proportional to the oxygen tension level of whole blood as early as 1 ms after application of the polarization pulse. Also, the subtraction of the discharging current component appears to stabilize electrode drift. The short polarization time required allows for the elimination of flow sensitivity by reducing the extension of the oxygen diffusion gradient to less than 8 μm from the electrode face. The short duration of active measurement will tend to decrease poisoning by allowing use of an operating duty cycle of minimal duration."
"A series of 4-channel physiological radio telemetry systems with long battery life and dc response capability have been designed and built. Twenty-one of these systems are used in the operating rooms on patients undergoing surgery at the Duke University Medical Center. The features of these systems are described."
"During the past decade, closed-circuit television has become an important means of displaying images in medicine. Important concurrent physiological signals in analog form are not readily displayed simultaneously with images using standard television systems. This communication describes a moving-trace design which superimposes analog traces on video images. Investigators can thereby directly visualize and evaluate relationships between images and dynamic physiologic variables."
"An FM-FM-modulated radio-telemetry transmitter for detecting and transmitting an electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration activity simultaneously on a single carrier frequency in the 88-108 MHz band is described. Respiration is detected by the impedance pneumographic principle by using the same pair of electrodes used for the ECG. The circuit requires less than 350 μA from a ± 7 V mercury battery supply and about 185 μA from a 1.35 V mercury battery. Signals can be transmitted over distances up to 50 ft for about 4 weeks without battery replacement and appreciable changes in calibration."

"The Influence of a thermionic type injected current on the performances of GaAs IMPATT diodes under large signal conditions is studied. This theoretical approach is developed by using the computer program previously elaborated for high efficiency IMPATT diodes. The parameters used to vary the operating conditions are the r. f. level, injection phase, d.c. current multiplication factor and base collector doping profile. Interesting results can be expected in X band with a transistor-like device in which the transistor effect, avalanche effect and transit time effect are use together."
"The performance of MESFET mixers used as down-converters from frequencies around 8 GHz to an intermediate frequency of 1 GHz is presented. Several possible mixer configurations have been considered and preliminary results are described involving the use of the MESFET in single as well as double device circuits. Experimental results concern the devices single sideband. noise figures and associated values of small signal conversion gain. Large signal saturation is discussed and results of third order intermodulation product are described. A single sideband noise figure of 7.8 dB associate with a gain of 8 dB at 7 GHz has been measured from a mixer using a single transistor."
"Silicon PIN switching diodes and GaAs varactor tuning diodes have demonstrated 100% performance improvements in quality factor Q by using straightforward optimization techniques, device processing innovations and improvements in materials. Analogous design techniques have been applied to both devices, including careful modeling to identify series resistance contributions, and directed process development to reduce these contributions. In both cases, substrate resistance was reduced to a minimum with processes that replaced semiconductor substrate with metal. Total resistance was minimized by analytical calculation to define optimum device geometries."
"Some improved techniques are described for characterising FETs at X-band frequencies. Device s-parameters are measured on an Automatic Network Analyser using co-axial calibration standards, and much better agreement has been obtained between theoretical and experimental amplifier responses. The measurement of minimum device noise figure, and more especially the accurate determination of optimum source impedance as a function of frequency, present some awkward problems at these frequencies. Some techniques will be presented which overcome many of these problems. The application of these techniques to practical amplifier fabrication will be illustrated by reference to several units, including a temperature compensated 9-10 GHz amplifier with 4.5 dB maximum noise figure, and a wide-band balanced amplifier."
"The development of GaAs Read Impatt diodes has resulted in the availability of reliable, long life, highly efficient CW and pulsed medium power devices. The use of a hi-lo Read structure with a grown GaAs p-n junction provides for the long life and highly efficient medium power devices. CW efficiencies in excess of 15% are routinely available at power levels of 2-3 watts. Pulse power outputs above 15 watts and with efficiencies of 20% are standard. For the pulsed devices, the results were obtained with a duty cycle of 25%. With these performances, lifetimes can be predicted to be in the 107 hour range for junction temperatures of 200°."
"We report X-band microwave measurements on superconducting thin film micro-bridges (Dayem bridges), mounted in a half wavelength cavity with an adjustable coupling to match the bridge properly. Power emission from the bridge of 10-13 W in a 10 MHz bandwidth was measured. Current noise fluctuations caused a total voltage line width corresponding to 150-200 MHz, when the voltage across the bridge was swept through the resonance; from this we estimate a total power emission of 1-2·10-12 W into this frequency interval. Transmission measurements and comparison with analogue computer calculations have revealed that an equivalent diagram consisting of an inductance in series with the resistively shunted Josephson junction model can account for the experimental results. A conclusion from these measurements is that there is a possibility for amplification in the device. Moreover, the nonlinearity of the device was used in a mixing experiment with the Josephson oscillation as local oscillator."
"The fabrication of Pt-Schottky Baritt diodes is described. Output power as high as 152 mW at 8.6 GHz has been obtained with an efficiency of 2.3 %. The highest efficiency of the diodes is 3 %. The signal to noise ratio is 150 dB and 100 dB for AM and FM noise, respectively. Minimum noise measure of 17 dB single sideband has been achieved. In Baritt diodes a negative rf-resistance can be obtained by barrier injection and transit time delay which make them applicable for amplifiers and oscillators in the microwave region. Because of the simple fabrication and low noise behaviour they have their own place between Impatt diodes and Gunn elements. The most commonly used structures for Baritt diodes are p+np+, p+nγp+ and metal np+. The highest output powers achieved so far are 115 mW at 6.3 GHz and 85 mW at 8 GHz for p+nγp+ and p+np+ structures, respectively [1,2]. The maximum efficiency of 4 % could be obtained by using a n+ipγn+ structure [3] which is rather difficult to fabricate. However, these diodes achieved only relatively low output power of about 13 mW at 7.5 GHz. In X-band the best efficiency attained is 2.6 % from p+np+ structures [2]. Schottky Baritt diodes have been producing lower output power and lower efficiency so far as compared to conventional diffused structures under similar conditions. In this paper the experimental results of Pt-Schottky Baritt diodes are reported showing considerable improvements over the earlier ones and also over diffused diodes."
"Generally microstrip stubs are coupled galvanically over the whole cross-section of the adjoining main lines. Reducing the coupling aperture two effects can be observed being superimposed: Smaller coupling apertures lead to higher skirt selectivity, increase, however, the excitation of higher-order modes in the main lines. The resulting transmission characteristics seem to provide new applications in stub filter design."
"The paper describes a new form of microwave branching filter which may be realised in either waveguide or a microstrip form. The filter incorporates a semicircular non resonant cavity in which the various output frequency bands are focused to emerge at different output ports. This concept can provide a large number of matched output channels without the use of circulators and the shape of the output frequency responses can be varied by control of the geometry of the filter design. Theoretical and experimental results are presented for prototype filter units operating at different microwave frequencies. Proposals are made to incorporate electronic control of bandwidth and centre frequency of such filters."
"The paper begins with a brief review of some of the shortcomings of the microwave microcircuit techniques most widely used in research and industry (e.g. microstrip, suspended stripline, and slot line). This is followed by a discussion of the advantages likely to be associated with the utilization of the coplanar line technique. The propagation characteristics are then determined using a digital calculation program. Finally, several applications are discussed involving or impedance matchers capable of operating at Ku-band frequencies."
"By loading the interior conductors of a classical combline filter with a series resonating impedance, very steep upper band skirt response may be generated. The procedure is particularly interesting for extending etched circuit combline filter technology to the lower microwave frequencies, with significant increases on filter performance and space requirements."
"Filters comprising dielectric wafers in TE10 mode rectangular, and TE01 mode circular or semi-circular waveguides are described. Their suitability for use in overmoded guides and for high power levels is explained. Design procedures and a computer optimisation process are formulated which allow wafers of standard thickness to be used. Examples of applications in a band-branching unit for a circular waveguide millimetric communications system, and a high power diplexer are given. Good agreement between computed and measured results has been obtained and constructional details and performance figures are presented."
"The basic design considerations for the 12 GHz low loss TE103 filters are described. The synthesis, optimization and realization of a new type low loss non-contiguous triplexer which uses the above filters and a WR75 manifold is presented. Test results of an engineering model unit currently being qualified for use in the F-4 Telesat Canada communications satellite are also provided, and are in good agreement with the calculated ones. The measured unloaded Q'S of the 4 pole TE103 dual mode elliptic filters used are well over 9,000."
"A general computer program package based on the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) is presented. The programs are based on a modular approach such that a complex geometry is broken down into smaller and simpler substructures. The applicability of the program package is illustrated by a number of examples ranging from dipole antennas mounted on simple geometrical structures to reflector antenna systems. A GTD-solution for a circular symmetric focus-fed reflector antenna is compared to a physical optics solution. It turns out, that with a uniform aperture illumination the two methods give almost identical results in the complete side-lobe region. The results expected for more realistic illuminations are discussed."
"A novel computational technique is presented for obtaining the numerical solution of transient electromagnetic scattering problems directly in the time domain. This technique consists of numerically stepping on in time the exact space-time integral equation that represents the solution of the scattering problem. The space-time integral equation and its numerical solution are described. Recent results are presented for convex targets, wires, targets with wires attached, and flat plates. The transient scattering results are compared with direct time domain measurements carried out with sub-nanosecond techniques and shown to be in good agreement. The merits of this time domain technique over more conventional frequency domain approaches are also discussed."
"The experimental investigations as described in this paper are based upon the evaluation of image-field distributions from the scattered fields of rotating objects measured at 36 GHz. Starting with a discussion of the reconstructing formalism and a suitable conversion into Fourier integral form, which is not restricted on small angular ranges, some illustrative examples of reconstruction for simple shaped objects (circular cylinders and flat plates) as well as for a more complex object in the plane of rotation are shown. The effects on the image quality due to various angular ranges used for the computer-aided reconstruction, and problems arising from fictive scattering centers, as a consequence of multiple scattering between various object parts, are discussed."
"A rather simple and general analysis allows calculation of the exact transient near- and far-fields of thin loop antennas, thin linear antennas and apertures directly in the time domain without the knowledge of the time harmonic field. A numerical method (SEM) is used to derive the influence of the antenna radius of linear antennas on the transient near- and far-fields. Application of this tool leads to the transient currents and fields of two coupled parallel identical antennas."
"An integral equation formulation in which the plane wave spectrum functions of a measured aperture appear as the unknowns is presented. Solutions to this equation are obtained by expanding the unknwons into sampling series and enforcing the equation at a finite number of near-field measurement points. Considerable amount of computer time can be saved by using an aperture-synthesis-technique in the near-field measurements. The method is applied to sectoral horns and good agreement between predicted and direct measured patterns is observed."
"In this paper we report a transform method for combining the integral equation and high frequency asymptotic techniques, e.g., the geometrical theory of diffraction or GTD. The method takes advantage of the fact that the Fourier transform of the unknown surface current distribution is proportional to the scattered far field. Two methods are developed for systematically improving the initial form of the high frequency asymptotic solution by manipulating the integral equation in the Fourier transform domain. Two salient features of the transform method are that it provides a convenient validity check of the solution and that it yields both the induced surface current density as well as the far field. Several illustrative examples that demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for handling a variety of electromagnetic scattering problems in the resonance region and above, and comparison with other methods are included in this paper."
"Spherical wave expansions are well suited to transform measured near-field data of an antenna to far-field data. In this paper a comparison between techniques for obtaining spherical wave expansions from near-field measurements is presented. The techniques are compared with respect to requirements on measuring time, computer storage, computer time and disk storage. It is concluded that the iterative method, Ludwig [2], and the Fourier expansion method, Wacker [5], offer nearly the same upper limit of the size of the antenna under test. Further, it is found that the iterative method requires a higher number of measuring points."
"Microwave imagery is commonly accepted to have inherently lower resolution than optical systems produce, and small scale microwave imaging systems should be particularly poor in this respect. Since Man is an optical imaging system, and also the ultimate recognition system, it is interesting to compare his performance with a microwave lens system which remotely images suitably reflecting targets. It is shown that the microwave system resolution can be only one order of magnitude inferior to the human eye-brain response. Given that recognition of objects is performed on their low spatial frequency components, the small scale microwave imaging system is comparable to human performance for simple target shapes."
"Optimised presentation of images from a microwave holographic system is essential, particularly the suppression of the effects of noise on the human visual system. Recent research into the human visual system has led to Fourier models of the visual cortex, and the proposition that object recognition is possible on relatively few critical low spatial frequency components. It is therefore possible to suppress interfering noise without losing essential object information by designing a suitable filtering function compatible with the human modulation transfer function, noise and object spectral distributions. A technique is described in which an unrecognizable microwave image distribution is processed to yield a clearly identifiable target shape."
"The absorption of microwave power on the axis of the eye was measured at 0.915, 2.45 and 9.0 GHz on a model of a human head. The absorbed power shows an essentially exponential decrease with the distance from the cornea at 9.0 GHz. At 2.45 and 0.915 a maximum in the absorbed power pattern occurs within the eyeball. The peak values are 50-100% higher for protuberant eyes than for deeper lying eyes. This indicates that microwave workers with protuberant eyes may be more liable to microwave induced eye lesions than others."
"A new method of biological sample characterization at millimeter waves has been studied to verify and extend Webb's experimental results. This method, based on interferometric measurements, is suitable to obtain an absorption spectrum of a living bacterial sediment with a high sensitivity. It has been applied in the frequency range 66-73 GHz. Some experimental results are reported."
"Since 1971, the Microwave Department of the 'Centre d'études et de recherches de Toulouse' is effecting research on the problem of measuring temperature and power density in electromagnetic fields. The possibility of obtaining a dielectric microprobe not interfering with electromagnetic waves was studied."
"A new technique for microwave (2450 MHz) heating of C3H mammary tumors is described. 1 cm tumors were encapsulated in 5 cm spheroids of a material dielectrically similar to biological tissues. When similarly heated, encapsulated tumor exhibited far more front-to-back temperature uniformity than unencapsulated tumors. Encapsulation also improved coupling of microwave heating fields. Tissue-simulating spheres were microwave-heated to the same temperatures in an anechoic range. Central temperature distributions were similar to those in the encapsulated tumors and agreed with theoretical predictions."
"Millimeter-wave thermographs for remote, noninvasive temperature sensing of the human body are described. Their penetration depth ranges from 0.1 mm to 1 cm thus overcoming the depth limitations of conventional infrared thermographs by several orders of magnitude. Potentially useful applications of this new method include clinical studies of the injured human spine and early detection of subcutaneous tumors such as breast cancer. Design details of an optimized, beam- or load switched thermograph for 69.5 GHz are presented which is presently undergoing clinical tests. It exhibits a temperature resolution of 0.25 °c for an integration time of 1 sec."
"In many practical applications the performance of offset parabolic reflector antennas are limited by the reflectors' depolarising and beam-squinting properties. The paper describes progress in the development of a new class of primary-feed antennas which overcome these major limitations. Computed data based upon analytical models of the antennas and experimental results obtained from antennas constructed for operation at 30 GHz are presented for applications which include both communications and tracking radars."
"The paper describes the prediction and measurement of the cross-polar radiation from corrugated feeds. The influence of the flange, periodicity of the corrugations and corrugation depth is identified and design recommendations are made. Satisfactory agreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions are demonstrated for feeds which are suitable for use at the prime focus or secondary focus of a reflector antenna."
"The characteristics of corrugated conical horns, radiating the balanced hybrid mode HE11 have been summarized in a number of linear curves giving the beam width at different levels versus the horn flare angle (2δ) and versus the radius of the horn aperture, normalized to the wavelength (α = r/λ). Moreover the feed horn performance for single or double reflectors antennas, have been analysed and curves are presented for the antenna illumination efficiency (aperture efficiency by spillover efficiency) versus parameters d and a. All the curves reported are a useful basis for the antenna design and give a fast and accurate solution to the following problems: - synthesis of a corrugated conical horn with a specified amplitude radiation pattern - synthesis of a corrugated conical horn as a function of the antenna illumination efficiency."
"The use of a beam waveguide feed for a Cassegrain earth station antenna has several mechanical advantages over a conventional feed. To ascertain the suitability of this type of feed for orthogonal polarization frequency re-use applications, a near-field diffraction analysis has been made of a configuration comprising offset sections of paraboloids. Emphasis has been placed on depolarization by the beam waveguide reflectors, the effect of inherent cross-polarization due to an imperfect feedhorn, and the effects of misalignments within the reflector system."
"A corrugated tracking modes coupler operating with any linear or circular polarization is described. This device propagates without disturbance the received and transmitted HE11 communication modes, and selects as tracking modes, the TM01 and HE21 modes by use of their specific phase velocities which are equalized by the proper design of the corrugated guide geometry. The tracking modes are coupled by four arrays of transversal slots in four \"collecting guides\" having the same phase velocity. Experimental performances in the 10.95 - 14,5 GHz band are given. They show a very low parasitic coupling of the HE11 mode, no distortion of its primary radiation patterns and a good tracking sensitivity."
"This paper describes the analysis, design and experimental evaluation of a Beam-waveguide feed for satellite communication earth station with frequency reuse, in the 11/14 GHz band. A theorical model is presented which accounts for the electromagnetic behaviour of the system by means of simple formulas and results in a simple synthesis procedure. Numerical results for a more refined analysis are presented. Experimental results are presented as well as main expected secondary performances."
"Double application of the Kirchhoff-Huygens-vector formula facilitates computation of the far field radiation pattern of dielectric antennas with rotational symmetry excited by cylindrical waveguides within practical computing times. In this paper special attention will be given to the near field expressions at the surface of the dielectric body, when higher order modes can propagate in the waveguide. These near field expressions allow a more analytical approach for the far field expressions. In designing medium gain dielectric antennas it would appear that the front of the dielectric works approximately like a lens and simple optical relations may be used for derivation of the curvature of the dielectric body. This computational method has formed the basis for designing a dielectric antenna with properties similar to those of a corrugated horn."
"Some substances as \"liquid crystals\" are not available in large quantities. In this paper, we present a measurement method of complex permittivity of liquids in Land C bands. This method is based upon the study of resonance frequency of the magnetic dipole mode TE01δ oscillating in a dielectric tubular resonator which contains the substance to characterize. Validity of the model is tested with well known liquids. We exhibit optimalization possibilities of the cell in order to measure low losses materials. Absorption characteristics of the p-methoxypheny lazoxy-p'-butylbenzène (M.P.A.B.B., nematic in the range 16 - 76°C) are then measured to illustrate the reliability of the method."
"Preliminary results obtained on an apparatus and a method for non-contact measurements on the dielectric properties of materials heated inside operating microwave ovens, are presented. Variations in the dielectric constant and the dielectric losses of a variety of materials (food, rubber, textiles, minerals, etc.) are measured inside a modified Toshiba 600 microwave oven. The temperature range of measurements varies from freezing temperatures to temperatures exceeding 1600°C. This new technique can be used to provide reliable heat controls on microwave ovens. In addition, such measurements can provide a better understanding of the dielectric-temperature dynamic processes involved when heating materials inside microwave ovens."
"We propose to measure the impedance of a millimeter IMPATT circuit by using a modulated microwave signal source -or a signal with two frequency components. The diode is biased below its breakdown voltage, and it is used both as a tuning capacitance and as a demodulator for the high frequency current flowing through it. This method enables to measure the circuit impedance and losses without dismounting the diode. It is capable of wideband operation even with frequency selective circuits."
"The determination of the complex permittivity for 35 and 70 GHz (8 and 4 milimetre wavelengths) presents several difficulties as soon as it becomes necessary to study materials with large permittivities and having large loss tangents (tg δ≃ 1). Therefore, for the chosen method, it is necessary to measure the displacements of the interferometric fringes of the order of 10-4 λ, which represent the limit of resolution of mechanical millimetre phase shifters. Furthermore, manual measurements - necessitate long and tedious double readings - cannot be separated from the inherent slowness of the temperature stabilization - are, by their slowness, at the mercy of source drift - do not lend themselves easily to the necessary repetition. For these reasons, it was decided to develop an automation of the existing interferometers, with the following aims: 1) increased sensitivity 2) rapidity of measurement. To illustrate the performance of the apparatus the authors give the permittivity curves for water and ethylene glycol over a large temperature range."
"This paper presents a unique way to measure the equivalent electrical length of a network as well as its deviation from linear phase. The measurement technique used is based upon a variable length transmission line simulator, built into the IF-structure of a 1.3 GHz Network Analyzer, but can be applied to higher frequencies. The new method allows to insert much more electrical length than the mechanical line stretchers do, without disturbing the measurement with additional mismatch errors. In addition to a calibrated readout of the equivalent electrical length in meters, the deviations from linear phase of a network can be presented very accurately in a real time swept display."
"This paper presents new results in the area of precision microwave measurements using \"six-port techniques\". These techniques allow one to compute the complex ratio of two signals using power measurements alone. After proper calibration of the six-port network, the output of 4 simple square law diode detectors completely determines the ratio of the scattering variables at the 2 remaining ports. A unified calibration procedure is presented which has the vitue of being conceptually simple and appropriate to both vector voltmeter and reflectometer applications. Finally, an automated microwave system designed to measure the scattering parameters of a two-port network over the 2 GHz to 18 GHz band will be described in the presentation."
"The development of an explicit and exact algorithm, computing the equivalent error representation for a network analyzer system, makes accurate measurements possible upon non-connectable microwave networks, embedded in complex transmission line environments. Typical examples are measurements at non-standard impedance levels and upon non-TEM waveguide modes."
"Both acoustic surface wave and charge transfer devices technologies are now maturing. The present paper presents a survey of few analog applications restricted to civil communication systems. Actually, the input signal is delayed and weighted in the same way in both devices. This yields two very important applications, i.e. delay lines and filters. In spite of disjoined frequency operation fields, the design of these functions are very similar in the two technologies and leads also to similar achievements in terms of BT product, dynamic range, etc... The present applications and the complementarity of both techniques are described."
"In this paper we review a number of quasi-optical waveguide structures and discuss their application to millimeter-wave integrated circuits. Some novel designs for dielectric waveguides and passive components using these waveguides are described. A summary of the results of theoretical and experimental studies of these waveguides and circuits is presented."
"A monolithic SAW device consisting of an rf sputtered ZnO film on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate has been shown to be useful for several signal processing and optical image scanning applications. The device efficiency and sensitivity can be varied greatly by employing any of several biasing techniques, both dc and pulsed. We report new effects related to a pulse biasing method which exploits surface states at the SiO2-Si interface. The increased optical sensitivity obtained by this technique makes the device an attractive optical scanner and optically programmed adaptive convolver."
"A frequency sensitive ASW structure is presented, operating by reflection of acoustic surface waves. Such a structure is of interest for frequency filters and filter banks. The response can be computed by scattering matrices leading to a good agreement with experimental results. Different configurations like fan shape electrodes can be used. In this paper, a 5-channels filter bank with a relatively good frequency separation between adjacent channels is presented. The relevant parameters like insertion loss, rejection, number of channels will be discussed and the other possible applications are described. This device meets the requirements of a frequency division multiplex."
 "Presented are the theory of operation and experimental operating results for two new types of acoustic-wave oscillators, one incorporating a surface acoustic-wave (SAW) delay line and the other a bulk acoustic-wave (BAW) delay line. SAW oscillators have been made that operate at up to 500 MHz, whereas the BAW types can operate at up to several GHz. Both kinds can deliver up to 20 dBm of output power and feature short-term frequency stability of a few times 10-9 and temperature-change stability on the order of 10-6 over the usual ambient-temperature range. Extreme compactness is another desirable characteristic of these oscillators, especially the SAW types, which are of planar construction."
"The present paper describes new solutions to reduce the diffraction losses in the microwave bulkwave delay lines. By backfocusing the spreaded beam produced by the transducer, it is possible to concentrate the acoustic waves and increase the efficiency of the delay line. In this way, we have obtained at 2 GHz a 8 μs delay line with an attenuation less than 16 dB. By the same principle, reflection and focusing of an acoustic wave, it has been possible to build multiecho delay lines producing pulse trains with well-defined codes."
"Narrowband jamming of a spread spectrum signal can be filtered out in the frequency domain using acoustic surface wave convolvers as real time Fourier transformers. This is accomplished by employing modulated chirp signals as inputs. The particular frequency range in which the jammer occurs can be removed from the Fourier transformed signal by using a d.c. pulse and a balanced mixer. These concepts are discussed and experimental results demonstrating the use of the device as a Fourier transformer (with 110 MHz center frequency, 25 MHz bandwidth, and 14 μsec interaction range and 220 MHz center frequency, 50 MHz bandwidth and 14 μsec interaction range) are presented. The performance of the spread spectrum receiver using either pseudonoise or Barker codes and different jammers is discussed."
"Filters employing the standard two-transducer configuration have an inherent 6 dB minimum insertion loss due to bidirectionality. Furthermore, they show a strong passband ripple owing to various reflections between the electrodes. In this paper, the applicability to very low insertion loss SAW filters of a recently proposed group-type unidirectional inter-digital transducer (GTIDT) is examined. Good agreement was found between theoretical and experimental data. A filter with minimum insertion loss of 1 dB without tuning and a passband ripple of less than 0.2 dB could be fabricated."
"An experimental parametric study of a microstrip antenna is given. This antenna is a flat, broad-folded dipole parallel to and at a short distance from a reflector plane. Radiating characteristics are excellent, and in particular bandwidth is sufficient enough for various applications in spite of a very small antenna thickness. An assimilation to a couple of radiating series strip lines permits to explain the antenna functioning and to refind the experimental results. We take account of radiating resistance and ohmic resistance losses spread allover the strips lengths."
"A printed circuit antenna which substitutes a paraboloid antenna in radio link applications at 1.8 GHz has been developed. The antenna is a novel traveling wave antenna, a so called grid antenna. It consists of a ground plane close to which is a printed sheet with several pairs of meander lines. The lines are fed in parallel from a coaxial line causing a TEM-wave to propagate along the lines. The parts of the lines which are parallel to the antenna axis radiate in phase while the radiation from the perpendicular parts is cancelled due to the currents flowing in opposite directions. The size of the realized antenna is 1.5 m × 1.5 m × 0.09 m. It has the advantages of being flat and thin and easy to manufacture. The measured gain at the frequency range 1700...1900 MHzis 24...26 dB and the beam width 8°. The direction of the beam depends slightly on frequency."
"A perturbation technique which will modify Taylor-type linear and circular aperture distributions to give sum and difference patterns with arbitrary side lobe topography is described and illustrated by several practical cases. A new technique for discretizing the resulting continuous aperture distributions is presented and shown to be superior to the conventional method of sampling. Experimental support of the theory is referenced for the case of a nineteen element linear slot array. Application to the design of digital filters is indicated."
"An L-band aircraft transmit/receive antenna for the future AEROSAT system is proposed. It consists of two identical phase-scanned four-spiral antenna arrays mounted laterally on either side of the upper area of the aircraft body. The fan-beam is pointed in 10 different angular directions such as to satisfy the 4 dBi minimum gain coverage in the field-of-view 10° above horizon. The antenna mounts flush with the skin cutout between two stringers and frames in aircraft with transoceanic capability. The coverage performance of the antenna is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally."
"The author presents a 32λ interferometer L-band array, part of an air-ground experimental data link system. The array is made of 8 E-plane wide angle sectoral horns using a technique of unsymmetrical leaky-wave correction in order to synthesize the required pattern: cosecant with high multipath rejection. This new development of a previous work is theoretically analyzed with simplifying assumptions, and an expression of the radiation diagram is derived which is compared to the measured pattern showing satisfactory results. Flight test results indicate an accuracy of 0.02° on the interferometer axis."
"The distortion characteristics of injection locked Gunn and Impatt diode oscillators are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. For FM signal transmission, the distortion is determined mostly by the derivated characteristics: group delay, AM-to-PM conversion and AM compression. Due to nonlinearity of diode susceptance, the group delay and AM-to-PM conversion characteristics are unsymmetrical. At the lower frequency end of the locking range, the distortion is rather high. Minimum distortion is obtained at a frequency higher than the band center. With the same output power, the distortion of an injection locked oscillator is smaller than that of a stable amplifier."
"The amplitude and phase of the fundamental and its harmonics at the output of various microwave solid state amplifiers have been measured as a function of load mismatch. Results are obtained for load impedances that lie on a selected series of VSWR circles on a Smith Chart and are presented as equi-power and equi-phase contours in the overall region of load variation. L-and S-band bipolar transistor modules designed for phased array antenna service and various experimental S-band TRAPATT amplifiers have been evaluated. The results are relevant to regulations on permissible radar emissions being drafted in the U.S.A."
"Silicon p+nn+ TRAPATT diodes have given X-band amplification with added power efficiencies of up to 25% and fundamental X-band oscillation with efficiencies as high as 35%. The diodes are fabricated by an Integral Heat Sink (IHS) technology and the p+n junction is formed by a combination of ion implantation and a drive-in period. Double-sided heat sinking has enabled oscillator performance to be extended to pulse-widths of greater than 5 microseconds, and mean output powers of 1 Watt have been recorded. Coaxial amplifier circuits produced small signal gains of 9dB, and large signal gains of 4dB with 1dB bandwidths of 500 MHz at 9.25 GHz with RF peak powers of over 12 watts. The design and performance of both coaxial and microstrip circuits is discussed."
"Several applications of V02 polyconductors at microwave frequencies are suggested for monitoring microwave power, switching, detection, protection, noise generations or steady-state oscillation. For these applications the basic microwave properties of VO2 devices or, film are measured to determine the input impedance versus frequency, the input impedance versus power, the scattering cross-section and the signal-to-noise ratio. Specific circuits are also presented to illustrate each typical application of the device."
 "Trapatt devices and circuits have been designed for use as solid state transmitters for pulse radars in the l-5GHz range. This has been achieved as a result of a device and circuit investigation in which pulse powers of up to 120 watts with 44% efficiency and mean powers greater than 1 watt have been obtained reproducibly from single diodes at 2.3GHz. An essential part of the work has been to relate real systems requirements to device design and also to device-circuit interactions. As a result of this understanding and the compatibility of the devices with M.I.C. techniques it has been possible to design compact reliable oscillators for the l-5GHz frequency range."
"The avalanche regions of 'lo-hi-lo' and 'hi-la' IMPATTs are significantly different even though their drift regions may be similar. It is likely that this will cause differences in the large signal behaviour of the two structures. This possibility is investigated using computer simulation."
"An equivalent network for rectangular shaped microstrip radiating elements is derived. In order to simplify the problem the radiating elements are considered as two slots separated by a transmission line of low characteristic impedance. The slots are characterized by their equivalent admittances. The radiation conductance is derived and found to be proportional to the width for wide strips and to the square of the width for narrower strips. The equivalent susceptance, due to end effects, is represented by a capacitor. The narrow bandwidth of the microstrip radiating elements is due to the high impedance ratio between the slot and the strip. Finally, the network model is used to design a dual polarized planar array."
"The limitations on the element pattern for linear arrays are studied and it is shown that the ideal element pattern is the omnidirectional pattern, leading to a very wide angular scan. Lossless interconnecting networks are used to improve the element pattern and the behaviour as the network size increases is investigated. Asymptotic expressions are given for very large arrays where the network effect is also shown."
"Analysis has been presented for a non-uniformly spaced linear array of large number of isotropic elements at locations obtained by simusoidal position modulation. Studies on the space factor of such an array reveal lower sidelobe and grating plateaux levels in comparison to the uniform array. This type of array can be designed to phase scan the beam over a very wide range with low sidelobes. The sidelobes are expected to be lower for nonuniform excitation. Computed results for a 147 element array have been presented to confirm the analysis."
"This paper describes the design and testing of a broadband active thick-folded-dipole, used for reception, between 0.4 and 1 GHz. This active antenna which exibits a good sensitivity can be used as an element of a directive array without a loss of bandwidth and sensitivity. For example an array of two active folded-dipoles in front of a reflector plane gives directivity about 10 dB upon an isotropic source between 0.4 and 1 GHz, and a better sensitivity than the isolated active antenna."
"Theoretical and experimental results are presented for a waveguide antenna with a cardoid-shaped pattern. The antenna, which operates in the S band, is proposed for telemetry and telecommand on future scientific satellites. The radiation takes place through eight axial slots placed near the end of a circular waveguide which carries a rotating TEll mode. A conical reflector may be attached to the waveguide structure to shape the pattern, which is calculated by solving the electrical field integral equation utilizing the rotational symmetry of the body. The paper also. deals with the excitation of the TEll waveguide mode and the matching of the slots to this mode."
"In multimode waveguides, many classical optical effects continue to exist in modified form, and new optical effects are observed. The talk gives a review of some of these effects. The thin-film optical waveguide, a 2 dimensional (2D) propagation medium, may be considered as a versatile artificial dielectric. Trough local design of the guide, a variety of optical elements for this 2D optics can be constructed in analogy to known 3D optical elements. Periodic guides show pass- and stopbands and act as reflectors and filters, and they are used in modulators and deflectors. Warping a planar guide into the third dimension offers new possibilities of optics which do not exist in ordinary, 3D optics. Thick optical waveguides, with homogeneous or graded index distribution, can form real optical images. Of particular interest for applications in micro-optics is the formation of multiple images in homogeneous rectangular waveguides."
 "When a radar altimeter is used over a rough ground surface, a noise component is added to the output signal. The mean deviation of the noise mainly depends on the range spread of the reflectors located within the antenna beam. The close relationship between noise and range spread can be used to estimate the height of surface roughnesses by low-resolution radar altimetry. Experimental results compare favorably with theoretical predictions."
"The replacement of the present Instrument Landing System (ILS) by the new Microwave Landing System (MLS) which is supposed to begin about 1980 is caused by increasing requirements for capacity, accuracy and coverage which ILS cannot meet. The increased accuracy is largely achieved by the use of microwave frequencies which implies larger antennas in wavelengths in spite of reduced physical dimensions. However, in many cases an unsatisfactory compromise has to be reached between requirements for high accuracy and demands for small antenna dimensions. A method to obtain good performance with relatively small antennas is to utilize a larger bandwidth for the transfer of signals as space and frequency are interrelated quantities. The transmitted signals are then modulated with a frequency much higher than the information bandwidth and demodulated in the receiver. In this way, a compressed pulse (for pulsed signals) or an efficient delay discrimination (for continuous signals) can be obtained by means of a correlating receiver. By exploiting the whole frequency band allocated for MLS use at C-band, the angle measurement accuracy can be improved as much as 20 - 80 times."
"In recent years the development of mm-wave pulse radars was pushed forward very rapidly. It can be shown that precipitation echoes, the main interference source, cannot be computed from the well-known formula for weather radars in which a conical energy distribution is assumed. It is necessary to approximate the real nearfield energie distribution. In this letter this is done by a hyperbolic transition from the effective antenna area to the farfield cone. The new definition for a nearfield gain is used to derive the equation for rain echoes from 1m to 10,000 m. It is shown that in contrast to the behaviour in the farfield the echoes are proportional to the inverse of the gain. This is because antennas with high farfield-gain have a low nearfield-gain."
"Over 750,000 hours have been accumulated on the klystrons and modulators that constitute the LAMPF 805-MHz rf system. The 1-1/4 MW klystrons, the floating-deck modulators and the modulator triodes are described. The operating data are summarized and the fault and failure modes are tabulated for the three major components of the system. The high-voltage processing and other maintenance required to keep this 86-kV system operating reliably are discussed. The crowbar rate, modulator-return rate and the modulator-fault rate are presented. The mean time between failures is > 53,000 h for the klystrons and > 45,000 h for the modulator triodes. The steps taken to produce such good reliability are discussed."
"A klystron has been developed as a transmitting tube for earth stations of transportable or mobile type. The klystron, rather than the TWT, was chosen to make the transmitter compact. It has five cavities and mechanical pre-set tuners to cover the frequency range of 14.0 ~ 14.5 GHz and employs the permanent magnet focusing. Experiments have shown that a satisfactory performance was obtained at 2kW operation with a 50 MHz instantaneous bandwidth."
"Two linearization methods: -Feed-back loop -Forward bias of base emitter junction are used in the design of L-Band linear amplifiers for multicarrier operation in view of achieving C/I figures in the range of 24 dB to 26 dB without significant sacrifice of the efficiency. These amplifiers are a key item of the satellite transponders devoted to the maritime traffic control (MAROTS) and of the future spaceborne L-band phased array systems."
"In this paper solid state microwave power amplifiers, which have been developed by GTE Telecomunicazioni for radio link equipments, are described.

Particular attention is paid to the performance improvements obtained by using broadband thin film frequency multipliers and transistorized microwave dividers."
"In this paper we shall present the results obtained at Thomson-CSF in the. realization of active electrooptical components using the diffusion of Titanium in LiNb03 Crystals. We shall discuss in details the switching problem and in particular the conditions required to obtain good switching efficiency and the different configurations that can be used. Recent experimental results concerning the directional coupler switch with different configurations will be given."
"A simple method for detection of electro-optical non-linearities in thin films is presented. The method involves an easily fabricated structure and a little practice in integrated optical techniques. It is also possible to detect small induced variations of refractive index, using lower voltage with respect to those applied in a conventional Kerr cell. We have sucessfully tested our method using two different polymer materials as thin films. In both of these we have observed an induced Δn ≃ 3 10-5 with an electric field of 60 V/μ, with a response time round about 300 nsec. The experimental values of induced Δn versus electric field fit very well a parabola, proving the quadratic behavior of Kerr effect."
"A rectangular dielectric semiconductor waveguide is theoretically investigated by transverse mode matching methods. In an experiment the resistivity of the semiconductor material is changed by illuminating with a GaAs laser beam. Depending on the configuration and intensity of the light spot the waveguide behaves like a termination or a short. This effect is controllable in position and time. In a further step the radiation from a local inhomogeneity in an open structure is intentionally used for generating a light-controlled radiating element."
"Two holographic couplers capable of coupling to each other two bundles of optical fibres are discussed. The analysis follows Kogelnik's method of deriving coupled differential equations inside the holographic medium. The arising partial differential equations are solved exactly for the transmission case whereas for the reflection case an approximation of somewhat more restricted validity is presented."
"In this paper we shall review a method permitting the observation of optical fields propagating in microstructures for integrated optics. This method is based on the observation of the fluorescence emitted by a thin plastic film deposited upon the structure to be examined. Some results concerning the observation of passive waveguides and LiNbO3 diffused waveguides will be presented. In particular transitions between guides of various widths and directional couplers were examined and we will present photographs and quantitative measurements made on these structures."
"The imaging properties of multimode dielectric waveguides of rectangular cross-section, having a homogeneous refractive index nf are investigated theoretically and experimentally. Two-dimensional self-images are formed by the phase coincidences of a large number of modes if the effective cross-section of the guide, including the penetration depths into the cladding, is a perfect square (side Wa). The first sinqle self-image is observed at the fundamental self-imaging distance L1=4nfW2 a/λ0, where λO is the vacuum wavelength. The theoretical linear resolution is approximately 1.5 μm for a guide of Wa≅44 μm. Experimentally, this resolution has not quite been reached contrary to the case of slab guides, but improved results are expected."
"This paper describes the 11 GHz and 15 GHz PCM radio relay systems, capable of conveying 65 Mb/s per radio channel, developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation NTT). The system employs 4-phase digital modulation and coherent detection. Radio equipment is fully solid-stated, using IMPATT diodes in the power amplifier. They are mainly. used for transmission circuits between telephone offices in large cities and for short haul transmission. The test results showed that compatible operation between 65 Mb/s PCM system and 2700 CH FDM-FM systems is possible, using the existing 11 and 15 GHz FDM-FM system frequency arrangement. These systems are now in use in 40 stations in Japan."
"In this paper a novel FM detector capable of suppressing the degradation in receiver performance due to the presence of an interfering signal is presented. This novel detector consists of two phase-locked loop FM demodulators interconnected in such a manner to permit one phase-locked loop to lock on to and track the stronger received FM signal while the other loop tracks the weaker of the two received FM signals. The detector has the capability of demodulating both the desired received FM signal as well as the interferer even for the cas e when both signals occupy the same frequency band. Experimental results demonstrating such capability are presented."
"This paper describes a technique for evaluating the performance of a PSK system when besides the effects of intersymbol interference and Gaussian noise we must consider a receiver including a nonlinear device and circuits for the recovery of sampling instant and carrier phase. This method allows one to compute the error rate in this most general situation when the combined effects of Gaussian noise. intersymbol interference and jitter in the carrier phase and timing recovery are taken into account."
"A multiplexer using quasi-optical filters, directional couplers, Tchebischeff and Butterworth filters and orthomode transducer, can operate simultaneously in four CCIR frequency bands for Microwave links : - One half 3.6 - 4.2 GHz frequency plan for Radio Links carrying 1800 telephone channels - One half 5.925 - 6.425 GHz frequency plan for Radio Links carrying 1800 telephone channels (CCIR Rec. 382.1) - One half 6.43 - 7.11 GHz frequency plan for Radio Links carrying 2700 telephone channels (CCIR Rec. 384.1) - One half 10.7- 11.7 GHz frequency plan for Radio Links carrying 1800 telephone channels (CCIR Rec. 387.1)"

 "Southern Railway have collected extensive data on microwave propagation over their 2000 KM net-work for over five years. The main problem of long path communication link is the occurrence of momentary deep fades of 10 to 40 dB for very short duration of 1 to 2 seconds. These dropouts. account for 80% of the total severe fading and about 60% of the total outage occur. in pre-summer months viz., February, March and April. The probability occurrence of deep fades increases very rapidly with distance and a computerised study indicate. that it is proportional to (Distance)10. Comparative study of Space Diversity and Frequency Diversity for long path indicates that Space Diversity reduces the outage time by 50% whereas Frequency Diversity wih even a small frequency separation of 1% reduces the outage by as much as 90%. Frequency Diversity, therefore, appears to be definitely more suited to tropical areas subjected to heavy momentary outages tban Space Diversity."
"The GaAlAs/GaAs stripe-geometry laser is analyzed using a new technique called the effective dielectric constant (EDC) method. Unlike previously reported techniques, use of the EDC method allows both vertical and sideward directions in the cross section of the laser to be taken into account in analyzing the field confinement mechanism. Computed data on field concentration and cutoff behavior are presented."
"Theoretical analyses and performance results are presented for two waveguides for integrated optics which are formed by metal platings, employing structures similar to those in some modulators or switches. One structure is a slot waveguide, formed by a slot or gap of unplated film on a substrate between two plated regions, for which previous analyses are incorrect for one polarization. The correct analysis shows that for that polarization the modes are leaky and that propagation occurs over a wider frequency range than expected. The other structure is a new one consisting simply of a strip of metal plated on a film on a substrate. Waveguiding with low loss is possible under appropriate conditions because metals at optical frequencies behave as overdense plasmas."
"The analysis of overlayed indiffused optical waveguides fabricated with ferroelectric materials (e g. LiNbO3 or LiTa03) to be employed in the realization of the hybrid integrated optic devices like modulators, switches, isolators, gyrators, optical read-out and so on is presented. In particular, the propagation constants and the mode mapping of the propagating TE and TM modes, the sensitivity of the effective refractive in dex to overlay thickness and diffusion constant, the single mode propagation criteria are derived when the substrate anisotropy is defined by a permettivity diagonal tensor. Then we have considered the effects induced by a modulating r.f. voltage that makes not null the permettivity tensor off-diagonal terms. At last, the Maxwell's equations in the diffused material region has been solved by a fast computer program based on the modified predictor-corrector method that allows a prefixed precision by varying the order and the stepsize of integration."
"With prism film coupler, we have studied the major contribution of nuclear process in index change and the influence of ion species, for low-loss waveguides."
"A method for the approximate calculation of the attenuation constant of dielectric film modes due to small two dimensional random boundary deviations from eveness is presented. The irregularities are replaced by effective sources, the radiated power of which accounts for the loss, suffered by an incident mode. Results for the H0-and E0-mode are plotted versus their film asymmetry parameters. When the deviations are assumed to be grooves transvers to the propagation direction, the problem becomes two dimensional and the results show good agreement with an earlier more accurate treatment."
"The use of lossy dielectric sidewall coatings for spurious Hm0 mode suppression in quasioptical waveguides is studied. It is discussed how to select permittivity, loss tangent, thickness and coating length. A resonance absorption occurs if the electrical thickness of the coating roughly equals λ/4. With approximations of the propagation constants in the coated waveguide section simple formulas for the resonance frequency and the attenuation below, at and above resonance are derived. A rigorous calculation of the scattering matrix at the junction to empty waveguide controls the approximate formulas. The spurious mode suppression can be improved by placing absorber foil in the evanescent mode region, of a discontinuity. This is shown with a miter elbow by combined scattering matrices and is verified by measurements."
"High and moderate power Ka-Band (33-40 GHz) Impatt diode amplifiers for use especially in telecommunication systems have been investigated. We point out the means of obtaining optimal conditions (for SDR or DDR diode parameters and operating conditions) for the principal amplifier characteristics : gain-bandwidth product, output power levels, group delay variations, AM-PM conversion rates. The theoretical results achieved, corroborated by the experimental ones, show the excellent behaviour of these Impatt amplifiers operating in telecommunication systems."
"It is shown that RLC feedback between the base and collector of a microwave bipolar transistor enables one to design a single-stage unbalanced amplifier with a two-octave bandwidth (0.5 - 2.0 GHz). Over this bandwidth the measured terminal v.s.w.r.'s are within 2:1, the gain variation is ±1dB and a noise figure ⩽4.6 dB has been achieved. The advantages of feedback are: (i) circuit design is simplified (ii) it is more economical than a balanced approach (iii) the gain of the amplifier can be varied by 3 dB by altering the collector current without degrading the terminal matches (iv) feedback reduces the effect of changes in transistor s-parameters (v) the amplifier is immune to parametric overload instabi1ities[1]."
"A linear power transistor with 1.6 μm emitter width, 34 emitter sites, and individual emitter ballast resistors has been developed using a new transistor process which has excellent reproducibility. Such a transistor has been packaged with a single stage of input matching which transforms the input impedance to an easily usable value in the 4 GHz region. Experimental linear output power of 500 mW has been measured with a corresponding gain of 7.5 dB at the 1 dB gain compression point at 4 GHz, and with useful gain and power at 5 GHz. Data is presented on the transistor's linear power performance, S-parameters from 2 to 5 GHz, and third-order intercept points."
"Parametric amplifiers have been extensively used in many varied and sophisticated applications (communications, radar, ECM, etc.), through Ku-band, in which relatively high cutoff frequency packaged varactors, with a self-resonance frequency in the 20- to 30-GHz range, have been utilized. The extension of paramps into higher frequencies (above 20 GHz) had been limited by both the cutoff frequency of the varactor, and the package parasitic reactances and losses that limited the upper useful frequency. Over the past few years, significant improvements in varactor technology have been made that have yielded much higher cutoff frequencies [approximately 600 GHz at zero (0) volt bias], coupled with low parasities, that result in a self-resonant frequency in the 60-GHz region. A diagram of this field proven varactor is shown in Figure 1. This improved varactor has made extremely low-noise temperature paramps available in the microwave region and has also resulted in the achievement of broader instantaneous bandwidths than had been previously obtained. Recently, further improvements in varactor technology have led to higher cutoff frequencies [above 1000 GHz @ zero (0) vikt bias] that will further enhance not only the achievable noise temperature and bandwidth capability of paramps in the microwave region, but will also enable the development of completely solid-state paramps in the millimeter wave region. These newly developed varactors have already been successfully used, up to 300 GHz, as frequency multipliers. The recent developments and expected performance, utilizing these advanced varactors, willbe presented."
"A rugged and reliable 4 GHz uncooled parametric amplifier is presented. The solution is particularly suited to domestic systems and for installations where cost of maintenance is a problem. It complies with the specifications for ground stations operating with Intelsat Satellites. Some features are: 1) a low pump frequency of 44 GHz from a reliable Gunn Oscillator operating at 11 GHz followed by a X4 multiplier. 2) a unique gain stability, particularly long term, assured by a very effective loop. 3) a compact and reliable 4 GHz W/G circulator with very low noise contribution and with intrinsic rejection of spurious signals generated by the transmitter. Design criteria and the principal parts of the project, as well as the results obtained will be described in the paper."
"The Fourier method of the dielectric micros trip line analysis proposed by Denlinger [1] is extended for the ferrite microstrip line case. After introduction of the fringing and edge mode effects, the logitudinal and transverse current distributions on the strip were used for solving the problem. The characteristic equation describing the fundamental edge hybrid mode is derived. Some experiments performed for the verification of the theoretical results are presented."
"The results of a rigorously formulated solution of the edge-guided mode on inhomogeneouslyand homogeneously ferrite loaded stripline are presented. The assumption that the width of the stripline is sufficiently large so that interaction between the edges may be neglected, has been invoked. In addition, it is assumed that the central strip conductor is located centrally between the ground plane and the shielding plate. This high degree of symmetry leads to a canonial geometry where we have a groundplane supporting a substrate of ferrite (x>o) and dielectric (x<o) or of ferrite alone. The substrate, in turn, supports a conducting half plane for x>o."
"Non reciprocal devices using the dynamic surface mode can operate on a broad frequency band. However, beyond a given frequency, some higher order modes can propagate and this fact limits the operational bandwidth. A theoretical and experimental investigation of the influence of ferrite slab roughness on modes conversion is presented. A perturbation method, developed in the case of an anisotropic medium, allows the computation of direct and reflected fields in the structure, for a given roughness. A good agreement between theory and experiment has been found with three different roughness. Two examples of particular applications for isolator structure improvement, i.e. very low insertion losses and very broad band devices, are given."
"EGW existence regions are identified on the mode chart of a disk MIC EGW resonator."
"This paper outlines a qualitative model which describes the action of ferrite limiters. Using this model a simple composite sandwich and slab limiter has been designed and constructed and has given a threshold of 15 watts, a maxim power handling of 50 kW, corresponding to a dynamic range of 35 dB at 8.96 GHz. The pulse was 0.7 μsec long with a p.r.f. of 1 kHz."
"This paper deals with a review of recent developments in the treatment of high frequency evanescent fields. Evanescent fields have conventionally been associated with guided modes. For dielectric waveguides, for example, the evanescent fields in a trapped (discrete) mode exist exterior to the guiding structure, and they are specified over the entire exterior cross section. This global character inherent in a modal description of evanescent fields is unnecessarily restrictive. By a recent generalization of ray-optical procedures far non-evanescent fields, asymptotic high frequency methods have been developed that permit the local tracking of evanescent fields. These fields are described to a lowest order of approximation by u(r) - A(r) exp[ikS(r)], where the phase S and the amplitude A are complex, and the wavenumber k is assumed to be large. Accommodated by this generalization are Gaussian beams, leaky waves, surface waves and waves on the dark side of caustics."
"During the last eight years significant advances have been made in the design and construction of microwave selective linear phase filters prompted by the need for maximum bandwidth utilisation in satellite communications. Very recently design procedures have been developed for selective linear phase channel multiplexers without the need for circulators or annulling networks, thus minimizing size and weight. In this paper a brief review is given of microwave selective linear phase filters and the more complex multiplexer problem with specific results for the symmetrical diplexer case."
"Microwave Ga-As F.E.T. characterization, starting from internal geometry is presented and extended to power F.E.T.A computer program, solving the transport equations for charge carriers in the channel versus biasing conditions and geometrical parameters, gives static characteristics and the equivalent circuit. Calculation of the saturation current and the breakdown voltage gives the maximum output power of the device together with the optimum load impedance. From these results, dependance of gain versus output power is derived. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental results are presented at 10 GHz."
"Results on computer-aided design of broadband GaAs MESFET amplifiers in microstrip is presented. The analysis of an amplifier is based on measured scattering parameters and a model of the microstrip structure, which includes parasitics and junction effects. The optimized performance of one stage amplifiers with lossless distributed matching elements is presented. Realized amplifiers are in good agreement with the theory. One stage amplifiers with a 1 μm FET in chip form exhibit 5.8 dB of gain in the range 8-12 GHz, while a gain of 4.5 dB from 4-8 GHz has been obtained with a packaged 1 μm FET."
"This paper describes the performance of a commercially available ½ um gate FET chip in a \"home made\" package as a low noise amplifier at 12 GHz. The package can be easily inserted into and removed from an alumina microstrip circuit. A single stage circuit is described, which in conjunction with the FET and package yields a gain of 8 dB ± 0.5 dB from 10.7 GHz to 12.2 GHz with an associated noise figure of between 4.0 dB and 4.5 dB at room temperature. A reduction in ambient temperature to -40°C is shown to result in an improvement in the noise figure of approximately 1.0 dB with a change in gain of less than 0.2 dB. The cascading of three single stages with a simple balanced mixer is described. The performance of the resultant low noise x-band front end is given."
"A single stage narrow band amplifier operating at 8 GHz has been developed with a noise figure of 2.2 dB and associated gain of 7.0 dB. Correcting for microstrip losses yields a device noise figure of 1.9 dB and associated gain of 7.6 dB. This result has been achieved with 1.3 μm gate length devices fabricated on a three layer material structure involving the growth of a high resistance buffer layer, an active n layer and an n+ contacting layer. Assessment techniques to determine device and material quality from DC FET observations will be described and a comparison of DC light sensitivity for different material structures will be made."
"GaAs power MESFETs capable of producing in excess of 600 mW with 6 dB gain and 33% power added efficiency at 8 GHz have been produced. The use of these devices in amplifiers for S, C and X-bands will be described. Techniques for effective heat sinking whilst maintaining low parasitics will be discussed together with the characterisation of the devices, including a technique for measuring device 'S' parameters under pulse bias conditions. Examples of amplifiers for the 2.7 GHz to 3.3 GHz band and the 5.0 GHz to 5.5 GHz band will be presented. A 9.5 GHz amplifier using one micron gate length power FETs will be described."
"The main mechanism of operation of a new transistor which shows exponential I-V character, is based on the static induction and is called SIT (Static Induction Transistor). SIT is a promissing device also for higher frequency operation because of (1) short channel length, (2) lower gate series resistance, (3) small gate-source capacitance, (4) small gate-drain capacitance. Si SIT exhibits GHz operation: 200 MHz-40 watts, 1 GHz-5 watts, cut-off frequency is more than 2.0 GHz. Further developments of higher frequency and, higher power devices can be realized in distributed structure and travelling-wave operation of SIT. It will be soon possible to prepare an SIT which operates 100 watts out-put power at GHz frequencies."
 "In the field of microwave integrated devices, non-uniform microstrip lines have recently received considerable attention. Among these, with regard to band-width and losses, non-uniform microstrips with a continuously varying cross-section have better characteristics than those having only rough discontinuities. In this work a theoretical analysis of non-uniform microstrip lines, based on a magnetic walls model, is presented. The experiments performed in a wide freque, ncy range have shown a promising agreement with the theory. Both theoretical and experimental behaviour show the existence of transmission and reflection zeros characterizing the filtering properties of structures of this kind."
"The launching of surface waves by discontinuities in microstrip circuits can cause extra coupling between adjacent devices. This paper gives measurements of the efficiency of an open circuit in microstrip to both launch and receive surface waves. The measurement technique is described in which the radiated waves from the open circuit are distinguished from the surface waves. These results are then applied to the linear resonator and the open-circuited tuning stub in microstrip circuits. In particular, how their position on the microstrip substrate can effect their performance. Finally, the paper discusses how the surface waves can be reduced to increase isolation."
"Frequency response of nonuniform line micros trip couplers is given by using a second order theory applied for the even and odd signals which have unequal velocities. This condition leads to finite isolation which becomes worse as the velocity separation increases. A modified structure to equalize the even and odd mode phase velocities is analyzed by a finite difference method applied to hybrid waves."
"The electrical behaviour of interdigitated directional couplers in an inhomogeneous dielectric medium is analyzed. Thanks to the symmetry properties of the device, the concepts of even and odd networks can be applied, leading to simple, closed-form expressions for coupler analysis which compare favourably with experimental results. The same model allows the most important parasitic effects to be understood and quantitatively described. It is shown that the discrepancies between computed and experimental data can be accurately explained in terms of the parasitics arising from junction discontinuities. Finally, design data for alumina-microstrip interdigitated couplers are presented in graphic form."
"Meanderline phase shifters in microstrip are badly matched (vswr ≈ 2), due to the difference in phase velocity of the odd and even mode of the coupled transmission lines. This is overcome by a stepped impedance design, allowing to realize e.g. a 90° phase shifter with a return loss better than 30 db across an octave bandwidth. Straightforward design equations are derived and confirmed by measurements on MIC's in the frequency range 4 to 8 GHz and X-band."
"A new method to construct permanent Josephson mixers for millimeter waves is described. In contrast to conventional point contacts which are mechanically unstable and require adjustments after each cooldown, these point contact junctions are set at room temperature, stay mechanically stable and can be temperature cycled without readjustments. The junctions are packaged in a modified Sharples mixer wafer and exhibit a single-sideband noise temperature of 71° K at 47 GHz. Based on these results system noise temperatures of less than 100° K are predicted for practical broadband radiometers, radar and communications receivers up to at least 100 GHz."
"A description of a mixer-receiver designed to operate at 80 GHz with an intermediate frequency of 2.7 GHz is given. An uncooled parametric amplifier is used for IF-amplification. The local oscillator injection is realized by a low-loss ring cavity directional filter. In single-sideband operation a cutoff filter is used for image recovery. The total noise figure of the receiver is 6.9 dB in single-sideband operation and 5.3 dB in double-sideband operation. The system was successfully used on the 13.7 m dish of the TU Helsinki for radioastronomical observations."
"The design and the experimental performance of a single-ended waveguide-mixer operating at a signal frequency of 14 GHz - 14.5 GHz and an IF of 3.7 GHz to 4.2 GHz is reported. The conversion loss over the IF bandwidth of 500 MHz was < 3.5 dB. The optimum load impedance for the mixer diode at the sum frequency is provided by a bandstop-filter, whereas at the image-frequency band the cut-off property of the waveguide is used. Also the theory of the mixing process of a Z and Y mixer is given. A computer analysis of the influence of the diode series resistance and junction capacitance on the conversion loss is presented."
"This paper shows that it is now possible to design devices incorporating dielectric resonators for frequencies up to 40 GHz. Theoretical models have been studied in order to compute with the required accuracy the resonant frequency and coupling coefficients between two resonators and a resonator and a microstrip line. Frequency temperature coefficient variation less than 2 ppm/°C has been achieved using \"composite structures\". These new temperature compensated resonators have been used in association with a millimetric microstrip low noise mixer and with a millimetric waveguide up converter. In this way, the suppression of the image bandwidth frequency for mixers, or of the lower sideband for up converters leads to a decrease of conversion losses higher than 1 dB."
"\"Plane mesa\" is the name for a new technology which yelds definite advantages when compared to traditional mesa structure, for straight forward stacking of chips, or for upside down mounting in order to reduce thermal resistances and (or) the series inductance. An example of practical application is presented in the field of stacked varactors for a doubler between 4 and 8 GHz. A single device in the standard F 27 d package delivery at 8 GHz - 15 Watts of peak power with a 50 % efficiency."
"An \"O\" band fast PIN diode SPST switch has been developed which has an insertion loss ⩽ 1.0 dB and an isolation ⩾ 25 dB over a 5% bandwidth. Switching speed is < lns and estimated power handling is ⩾ 1 watt c.w. The unit is to be used as a modulator in a 60 GHz, 130 megabit/see digital radio data link under development at RSRE Malvern. The active element is a gold doped P+NN+ diode which is switched in a resonant mode as discussed by Garver (1). An inductive strap is used to series resonate the reverse biased diode and this is connected to a quartz standoff which is mounted across a section of single ridge guide. Tchebycheff, ridge guide, impedance transformers match the section to WG25/WR15 guide. To obtain increased isolation bandwidth a two diode cavity is being developed and the final switches will be integrated with a driver to keep switching time and delay to a minimum."
"GaAs avalanche diodes for multiplication have been studied from 3 different points of view: theoretical, technological and circuit design, in order to obtain high efficiencies in the mm waveband. The GaAs diode design is explained and compared to that of Si diodes. The technology is then described and the importance of the idler impedances at the second and third harmonics is stressed. The best results are presented : conversion loss of 6 dB with 400 mW at 4 GHz to 100 mW at 32 GHz with 1.5 W D.C. power applied. Finally, the experimental results are compared to those predicted by a computer simulation, of the diodes impedances which were measured either by a substition method or by a new technique (1)."
"The capability of potentially low cost thick film micros trip is extended in frequency range, augmenting previous work restricted to below 12 GHz. Line characteristics are presented and compared with thin film results. Thick film Q-factors approach 80% of thin film values and medium definition circuits are possible. Test circuits designed and tested include band-pass filters, couplers and resistive components, emphasis being on simple fully printed configurations providing wideband performance."
"For precision applications MIC's have demonstrated improvements in performances by eliminating transitions which introduce interface errors. In this paper high performance MIC attenuators and loads are employed to evaluate or reduce such errors. A method is described, based on computer analysis, which predicts attenuator and load terminal functions. This has led to reproducible designs requiring no adjustment for thin film attenuators operating from DC-18GHz having ±.1dB variation with good stabilities and VSWR's of ⩽1.1. Two methods of fabrication are presented. Applications described are matching of high VSWR components, precision attenuators and the development of microstrip loads having VSWR's ⩽1.1 from DC-18GHz used to evaluate single SMAand feed-through connectors."
"The advantage of the lumped elements are smaller size, improved bandwidth, increased reproducibility, less weight and a potential cost savings. With the traditional technologies, it was not possible to obtain low loss lumped circuits above 3 or 4 GHz. That is the reason why L.T.T. has developed new technologies and investigated the electrical characteristics and some applications of R L C lumped circuits up to 15 GHz. These works allow us to realize : inductors with Q greater than 40 at 15 GHz and capacitors with series resistance less than 1 Ω up to 18 GHz."
"A new method is developed for accurately predicting resonant frequencies of dielectric resonators used in microwave circuits. By introducing an appropriate approximation in the field distribution outside the resonator, an analytical formulation becomes possible. Two coupled eigenvalue equations thus derived are subsequently solved by a numerical method. The accuracy of the results computed by the present method is demonstrated by comparison with previously published data."
"The dispersion curve and attenuation constant of the open ring line operating in the fundamental dipolar mode is discussed and this line is shown to be a low loss structure. Measurements on a line consisting of equally spaced rings of an aluminium-alloy held by a metallic rod agree with theory. The attenuation is less than 5 dB/km below 1.8 GHz. Possible applications include railway obstacle detection and telecommunications."
"Over 850,000 hours have been accumulated on the klystrons and modulators that constitute the LAMPF 805-MHz rf system. The 1-1/4 MW klystrons, the floating-deck modulators and the modulator triodes are described. The operating data are summarized and the fault and failure modes are tabulated for the three major components of the system. The high-voltage processing and other maintenance required to keep this 86-kV system operating reliably are described. The tube failure rates, tube fault rates and modulator fault rates are presented. The mean time to failures is > 56,500 h for the klystrons and > 40,600 h for the modulator triodes. The steps taken to produce such good reliability are discussed."

   "A simple classical model utilizing image forces has been developed which shows that the energy required to extract an electron from an insulating particle depends inversely on: 1) the size of the particle, 2) the dielectric constant, and 3) the maximum natural excursion distance of the electron from the surface of the insulating particle. As anticipated, data confirm that the ionization energy of an insulating polymer molecule is inversely related to the number of monomer units in the polymer molecule. Considering the solid insulator as the limiting case of a macroscropic particle, the predicted work function of the solid is the minimum value of the steadily decreasing ionization energy with size. This is in agreement with the limited data which show that the work function of an insulating polymer is approximately 1/2 of the ionization energy of the monomer in the gas phase. The model also predicts that the work function decreases with increasing dielectric constant in agreement with some limited available data."
"Many modern computer, digital communication, and industrial control equipments are furnished dc power by series-pass regulated supplies. At the voltage and current required, these supplies frequently dissipate twice as much power as they pass on to be used. With increasing interest in conserving energy, it has become desirable to minimize the losses of the supplies. This can be done at modest cost by installing a simple preregulator which is itself relatively efficient. This paper presents the experimental results of comparing three methods of preregulation. The three methods chosen can be retrofit in many existing systems. The three are 1) ferroresonant transformer, 2) replacing existing rectifiers with SCR's, and 3) triac throttling of the input. Each of the three methods has some relative advantages, and each has its detractions. On balance, it appears from measurements reported here that triac throttling is the best method."
"Problems of standardization exist for capacitors used in power semiconductor equipment. Electronic Industries Association (EIA) has taken a step forward in this area by publishing an industry standard for commutating capacitors. Details of definitions, case types, terminals, ratings, measurements, life tests, performance characteristics, and general applications of these capacitors are covered in the proposed standard. This paper describes part of the EIA program and also includes limited information on the design of commutating capacitors and their use in power semiconductor circuits."
"Corrosive environments have long presented problems in application, installation, and maintenance of electrical equipment. The causes of corrosion and the means taken to date to combat corrosive environments are briefly reviewed. The application of new technology in the glass-reinforced polyester plastics field is described as a solution to the problem of long-term protection of electrical equipment installed in aggressive environments. This new technology involves the use of chemical thickening of special polyester resins suitably formulated to provide high levels of structural strength and corrosion resistance both indoors and outdoors. Data are presented on the environmental resistance of the chemically thickened glass-reinforced polyester systems, and these are interpreted in terms of the diffusion of the environment into and out of the plastic. Examples are given of the application of chemically thickened glass-reinforced plastics in heavy duty industrial plugs and receptacles, industrial type light reflectors, and enclosures for electrical equipment. The degree of protection afforded by the chemically thickened glass-reinforced plastic is important in electrical installations in the petroleum, petrochemical, food, drug, fertilizer, and other process industries."
"Lighting engineers' best contribution to the energy conservation movement will be to optimize the application of new and highly efficient lighting sources in an esthetic way. In order to achieve this goal, creativity is the key. This could bring lighting esthetics and energy conservation into coexistence. This paper outlines some creative lighting systems which use highly efficient light sources to achieve energy conservation as well as esthetic appearances."
"This paper will explore the design, application, and field operating experience of the first complete line of 25-1000 hp solid-state ac motor starters. The contents are as follows: 1) the basic requirements of ac motor starting; 2) power circuitry-a brief review of solid-state; 3) a complete solid-state ac motor starter with provision for reduced voltage starting; 4) application problems, advantages and disadvantages of solid-state; 5) the ``hybrid'' motor starter; 6) new dimensions for squirrel-cage motors using solid-state control; 7) limited range speed control using variable voltage, fixed frequency; 8) the universal replacement. Is it practical?"
"It has been shown [1] that use of a ``fast feedback'' loop incorporating a plant model and a two-position controller results in better control of first-order thermal plants with inherent time delay. In this paper such a control scheme is analyzed with a view of adapting it for process control. Both steady-and unsteady-state analyses are carried out for the case where disturbance variations occur during regulatory control. Based on the results obtained, criteria are evolved for the selection of suitable model parameters which result in zero offset in plant output, minimum period of steady-state cycling, and acceptable transient behavior."
"Two methods of induction motor torque regulation are described utilizing speed and current feedback into the frequency and amplitude channels of a pulsewidth modulated inverter. Transfer characteristics illustrating the steady-state behavior of the two configurations are presented. Transient characteristics are discussed in detail by examining the linearized system transfer functions. An analytical approach to design of a closed loop controller for a practical application is outlined. Experimental results are presented showing correlation with predicted results."
"Research and development in diverse fields of scientific and engineering interest often require a knowledge of the electric charge on a single macroscopic particle. The methods which have been developed for the determination of particle charge include electric and magnetic field deflection techniques, current measurements, and direct sensing by induced charge effects. Several methods are discussed, and experimental results are given for two of these methods. Charge magnitudes to about 10-17 C are of interest in these studies."
"Special features have been developed to improve scorotron efficiency, manufacturability, reliability, and serviceability for the office copier environment. Unidirectional rotation of the photoreceptor allows the higher efficiency of a combination corotron/ scorotron to be used. A simplified screen configuration, an extruded shield, and high quality molded plastic end blocks simplify manufacture. A wraparound shield, a manual cleaner for corona and screen wires, and a foolproof slide mount, improve reliability and serviceability. Thus a scorotron is able to provide the improved consistency of photoreceptor sensitization necessary for high quality solid area reproduction copies. Charging nonuniformities caused by photoreceptor fatigue, thickness variation, temperature sensitivity, and miscellaneous charge acceptance variables, are significantly reduced."
"Measurements with multiple techniques delineating the complete sequence of events from the primary streamer to the formation of the spark channel for relatively small point-to-point gaps are reported. The pulsed potential with 0.4 µs rise time and 1800 µs decay time was applied to the point-to-point gap, of which length was changed from 6 to 14 cm. The light pulses were observed by 5 photomultipliers as well as current and potential wave. It is shown that the spark channel can be materialized through the following three processes: 1) initial process, in which the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary streamers develop from both point electrodes into gap, and the ionizing wave bridges the gap; 2) intermediate process, in which the dark period proceeds with ion and electron movement if the applied potential is around the mean breakdown potential, or in the other case, the ``leader'' develops from the anode with the help of ionizing waves; and 3) final process, in which the channel is highly ionized at first by the ionizing wave, then gas heating, to lead the formation of a spark channel. On the bases of the measurements of streamer speed and current, the ion and electron density were calculated. It is estimated that starting with the primary streamer with an electron density of 1012 cm-3, the electron density in the streamer channel is augmented by the ionizing wave up to 1012cm -3 when the gap is bridged by the ionizing wave."
"Where the resistivity of a precipitated layer of dust exceeds a value in the neighborhood of 108 Ωm, the phenomenon of back corona generally occurs. The fact that this is not always the case, however, shows that the phenomenon is not perfectly understood. In 1965, the author introduced to the theory the additional factor of the dielectric constant. This had the effect of making relaxation time the fundamental parameter of back corona, rather than resistivity alone. As a result, it is shown that back corona probably depends on conditions in the gas as well as in the dust."
"Synchronous ink jet printing systems use a small fluid ink stream, as produced by a pressurized ink through a small orifice, to produce ink images on a recording surface. The initial stream breaks up into a uniform sequence of similar droplets as a result of velocity variations injected by the orifice assembly. As the droplets form, individual droplets receive charges by induction. The charges imparted to droplets determine their flight path through an orthogonal deflection field to the recording surface or, alternatively, to an ink dump. The mechanism of drop formation, drop charging, drop deflection, and aerodynamic interactions between drops, and how these influence an ink jet printer's performance, are discussed. In addition, since the fluid dynamics limit the range of applications for ink jet printing, some limiting factors are described."
"Results of the investigation of the performance of solar cells when directly coupled to a conventional three-phase power network are presented. This approach dissociates the electricity production problem from the electric energy storage problem. Extensive studies of the required power inverter are performed. Preliminary simulation results indicate that ac power outputs of better than 90 percent of the optimum cell power output can be easily achieved by means of a suitably controlled inverter, thereby justify"
"On-line real-time computer and data processing systems such as United Air Lines' Denver Computer Center have many and varying needs. Not only must the electrical power supply be continuous and disturbance-free, but the environmental support systems must not fail. This paper describes a facility, unattended for long periods, which provides for the needs of the people and the expensive equipment associated with that system, even if all outside utilities (except for communications) are lost. The facility, while dually functioning as a dynamic uninterruptible power supply as well as a total energy plant, has been described by some as ``The Friendly Skies' Best Friend.''"
"The development of grinding mills, especially in the last few years, shows a continuing trend to larger units. Particular attention must be given to the drying process during dry grinding. Several grinding methods are available, depending upon the material to be ground, and the optimum method must be carefully selected in each case. Special consideration must be made with large ball mills to assure the utilization of all waste heat from the kiln for the drying process. In many cases a roller mill represents a good alternative."

  "The presently constituted laws of physics do not allow us to explain the forces that exist when current-carrying conductors are in a magnetic field, if these conductors are within a magnetically permeable structure. This is of significance if for no other reason than because most motors wound on an iron core fit into this case, and the mechanism by which they work is not now truly explainable. This article will explain the problem, discuss an experiment that was conducted to isolate the forces that exist on the magnetic structure and the conductor, and finally suggest a revision in the expression for the electromagnetic force law1 which also accounts for situations where the current-carrying conductors are within a magnetically permeable structure."
"The currents and load voltage of a two-branch resistance-inductance parallel circuit controlled by an ac switch in series with the supply are derived. It is shown that the extinction angle is a transcendental function of the ratio of the absolute values of the load impedances, the load phase angles, and the triggering angle, but not (as claimed by another author) of the supply voltage."
"An analysis of the behavior of single-phase transformer coupled loads controlled by an ac switch is presented. The current and load voltage equations are derived taking into account the principal parameters of the transformer, and it is shown that the extinction angle is a function of the ratio of the inductances, an equivalent time constant, and the triggering angle. Through the suggested analysis more exact results are obtained than compared to the conventional analysis."
"A relatively new semi-analytic method for solving Laplace's equation has been studied in detail and compared with various long-established techniques, which are also briefly reviewed. The method involves dividing the boundary of a region into N segments, each of which has an unknown surface charge. The surface charge on each segment is assumed to be constant or to be represented by a low-degree polynomial. In the latter case, charge and even derivative continuity at the segment boundaries can be imposed. The potential produced by each segment is expressed analytically and satisfaction of the boundary conditions determines the unknown charges. The latter calculation requires the solution of N linear simultaneous equations. The resulting charge pattern enables one to evaluate the potential and/or electric field at any point with no further difference approximations. This procedure compares favorably both in computation speed and accuracy with other numerical and semi-analytic techniques, viz., net, Monte Carlo, and collocation methods."

"Ball Corporation is now field-testing an electronic programmer for IS bottle-making machines. Using a COS/MOS memory programmed on a decimal keyboard and clocked by machine-driven shaft encoders, the programmer operates electropneumatic actuators that trip the machine control valves. An operator's control station near the machine can refine the program while running, and the program can be stored on magnetic tape. An earlier version, programmed with thumbwheel switches, has been operating a machine section for several months. Both have programmed start-stop sequences. The earlier version has provided safer operation and greater accuracy. The second can also reduce programming time for repeat jobs to about 5 min per section."
"Thermal fuses are the devices most commonly used for effective equipment protection against fault currents within solid-state power systems. Original equipment cost versus additional expenditures for protective devices warrants elaborate means for safeguarding the investment while maintaining cost effectiveness. This has resulted in a vast variety of individually high-priced specialty fuses. Experience indicates that a large number of thyristor current-limiting fuses must be expended during the design phase of solid-state power conversion equipment so as to properly investigate converter circuit malfunctions due to nonrecurrent circuit transients. Thermal fatigue of fuses during field use necessitates a considerable logistic support in order to sustain the bulk of multifused complex power converters. This large demand cannot be satisfied at all times due to the limited number of prime suppliers, and due to the range of size, bulk, and price of present thermal thyristor fuses. Thermal analysis and extensive testing furnishes strong evidence that the desirable low-cost thyristor fuse link is feasible. This low-cost item is well-suited to protect thyristors against catastrophic failures within the constraints of any thermal fuse. Since the fuse is renewable, it compares favorably with presently used commercial thyristor fuses in terms of bulk and potential cost savings as well as in its flexible simplified rating mechanisms."
"Utilizing a signal from transistor transistor logic (TTL) circuits, the integrated power switch (IPS) can control 40 kW. Protection against overload conditions enables the use of transistors which have ideal switching characteristics. Each half-section of the IPS is electrically isolated from the signal input using optical couplers. Discrete component assemblies, printed-circuit boards, thick-film or medium-scale integrated substrates each have been utilized. The forced-air-cooled heat sink was designed for maximum cooling. Two types of IPS's were initially constructed: 500 V/60 A, and 100 V/200 A, with additional availability of 500 V/100 A devices in small quantity. Its capability to work from continuous operation to 10 kHz makes the IPS universally applicable to most power-conversion applications with-in its current and voltage limitation."
"A method for the cascade connection of switching regulators is introduced which is useful for low-voltage power supplies. It is common to use a reactor with a secondary winding in order to obtain a sufficiently small step-down ratio (Eout/Ein). In this method, how-ever, a switching surge occurs because of the leakage inductance of the two-winding reactor. On the other hand, by the method presented here, we will be able to have a sufficiently small step-down ratio and a sufficiently large regulation range with no occurrence of the switching surge. Furthermore, a new method is proposed for isolating the supply and the load circuit."
"The multitude of uses for lamps in the various steps of the xerographic process are enumerated. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of gas-discharge lamps for exposure, with their requirement of spectral control and adequate radiant power. The characteristics of various types of lamps are considered and the existence of a trouble-some ``power gap'' is uncovered. The efficient performance of low-pressure arcs (such as fluorescent and low-pressure sodium lamps) is limited to low powers by electron de-excitation in the presence of self-absorption. On the other hand, high-pressure arc lamps perform efficiently at high powers, but it is difficult to operate these lamps at lower powers in the ``power gap'' because of a complex set of interrelated reasons. Lamp designs which may fill this power gap are discussed. The radiant emission from various lamps is considered as well as techniques for manipulating the spectra, particularly the use of metallic halide additives. Overall, a major problem is that commercially available lamps reservice are designed for general illumination purposes while the electrophotographic requirements are different and more demanding."
"A method called Selective Transfer may reduce or eliminate background in xerographic copies. Background, or toner deposited in nonimage areas, has always been a problem in xerography. Adjusting development parameters can help keep background at relatively low levels, but the emphasis on higher speeds and solid area development in the newer machines puts practical limits on background reduction. Previous efforts to reduce background have concentrated on two general techniques: 1) nondevelopment of background, and 2) processes for selective fusing combined with abrasive cleanup."
"An experimental procedure is reported for the determination of the triboelectric charging of polymer films, which has sufficient precision to allow systematic observations of the variations of charge values which result from systematic changes of polymer structure (by copolymerization and with additives). A simple model is proposed fo brief contact triboelectric charging, which involves interplay of ``work function'' and conductivity as thermodynamic and kinetic factors, respectively. This model is based on earlier work reported in the literature, in which the magnitude of charging is related to the work function difference and the rate of charging to polymer conductivity. Two series of polymers of systematically varying conductivities have been synthesized and their triboelectric charging values are discussed in terms of the above model."

"This paper discusses the problems and solutions of applying reactive compensation, either static or dynamic, to industrial power systems supplying large blocks of dc power from diode or thyristor converters. The resonance between power capacitors and system reactance can produce high harmonic voltages caused by the harmonic currents generated by converters. The interaction between these harmonic voltages and regulating systems can be minimized by the use of suitable filters. The design of these filters should eliminate the interaction between power system and load and reduce harmonic current flow. Different methods of reactive power control are also discussed."

"The use of aluminum in fabricated cage windings of large induction motors has been explored, and it was found that aluminum and its alloys present a viable alternative to copper and its alloys. This paper enumerates the advantages and limitations of aluminum as a cage material, outlines the considerations necessary in the utilization of the material for this application, and summarizes the results of a testing program which demonstrated the adequacy of aluminum alloy cages in full scale machines."
"A new electrical transmission drive that insures an adjustable constant speed difference between a pair of mechanical shafts independent of load conditions or speed level is described in the paper. This generalized electrical shaft comprises two rotor interconnected induction machines, fed from different frequencies and two dc machines forming a double Kramer cascade. The use of the Kramer cascades offers many important advantages over the alternative simpler scheme of'using resistors in the rotor circuit, namely, higher efflciency, much lower speed dependence on load, and speed level adjustability in the subsynchronous range. The drive performance is analyzed by means of an equivalent circuit from which the current and torque expressions are derived. Good agreement is obtained between theoretical and experimental results."
"Ten to 100 kVA multimotor variable frequency inverter systems are generally unstable over part of their frequency range. Experimental results from dozens of tests made with single and multimotors, and with several inverters varying in capacity and output impedance, are presented. Aberrations in output shaft angular velocity is the measured variable. Both gain and phase measurements are made while controlled excitation signals are applied to the inverter system. Practical stability criteria for synchronous motors are presented. A system model is presented in block diagram form. Correlation of theory with previously published synchronous reluctance motor analyses is achieved."
 "The gas industry for years has used the same philosophy of gas measurement; however, today's gas supply picture is making it imperative that accurate and immediate data on volumes are available. The approach described in this paper is a computerized system affording continuous readouts at central gas control offices for monitoring and billing."
"The sparking voltage (Vs) and maximum presparking corona current (Imax) of needle-to-plane coronas have been measured as independent functions of polarity, tip radius (r), and needle-to-plane spacing (S). For a negative needle, Vs and Imax increase with S but are independent of r. For positive polarity, Vs and Imax increase with both S and r. Thus to increase the corona current while avoiding a spark, one should increase the spacing and voltage. At large spacings, Imax is appreciably greater for negative polarity than for positive. Analysis of the data reveals that for negative polarity the maximum presparking current may be written in the approximate form Imax∝Vs(Vs-VO)S-2 where VO is the corona threshold voltage. This is an extrapolation of a relationship previously obtained for Trichel pulse corona. The analysis shows that the transition from negative corona to sparking occurs when the linear space charge density in the gap reaches a critical value Qs/S ≅10-10 coul/mm, where Qs is the total space charge in the gap just before sparking occurs. It is shown that this condition amounts to spatial overlap of the multiple ion clouds in the gap, thereby creating a continuous ionized channel between the electrodes."
"An analytical computer model of an ink jet printing system was created. Based upon the values of 13 input parameters, the program delivers predictions of the forces acting on individual drops and their resulting dynamic behavior. Predictions of drop displacements and flight times were used to infer drop pattern appearance resulting from a given input signal. The computer model was based upon theoretical work plus extensive empirical measurements. Drop behavior was predicted with modest accuracy. An improved understanding of ink jet printing systems and numerous recommendations for their use were also derived in this study."
"The recovery characteristics of high power thyristors and diodes becomes increasingly important to the circuit designer as devices are made larger and faster. This paper considers various types of recovery as well as some important circuit influences on the recovery characteristics of power devices. Low and high frequency device data are presented for a number of different circuit conditions. The effects of spreading velocity, peak current during conduction, conduction pulsewidth, and commutating di/dt are considered. A new method for recovered charge data presentation is shown and some practical test circuit design considerations are discussed."

In making his decision, he evaluates initial cost, convenience, degree of protection, replacement cost, etc. This paper outlines these tradeoffs in a concise manner so that an individual selecting short circuit protection for a motor branch circuit can be aware of them and select the protective device which optimizes the concerns he feels are most important."

"This paper discusses the design, development, and successful use of an electronic instrument for the evaluation of grease noise in electric motor grade ball bearings. No evidence was found that grease noises were harmful to the proper mechanical operation of the ball bearings. However, it did segregate ball bearings that would, in a motor, produce psychologically irritating noises due to grease that were unacceptable to appliance manufacturers. The evaluation suggests ways in which devices such as the ball bearing noise tester can be used to assist the manufacturers of ball bearings and lubricating greases in developing standards that soon may become necessary because of the new emphasis on the ecological significance of noise."
"The use of switching regulator circuits at high power levels and high frequencies requires careful examination and control of the power dissipation during switching, which may be the dominant loss. In this paper it is shown that it is possible to remove most of the switching losses from the switching transistor with two networks, each containing three components: an inductor or a capacitor, a diode, and a resistor. With proper design, the power dissipation in the resistors is less than the switching losses removed from the switching transistor, resulting in some improvement in overall efficiency. In addition, it is possible to obtain a significant further improvement in efficiency by replacing the resistors in the networks with low loss circuits. Each network, one for the reduction of turnoff losses and one for the virtual elimination of turnon losses in the switching transistor, is described in detail. Analytical design procedures are included."
"A new regulated dc to dc converter circuit gains several advantages over conventional approaches by separating the pulsewidth control function from the inverter. The distinguishing feature of the new circuit is the relocation of the principal filter inductor from the rectifier output to the inverter input. This departure from the conventional use of a shunt capacitor at the inverter input yields a number of fundamental improvements. These include the following: substantially reduced inverter switching losses, elimination of transistor switch-through and transformer saturation problems, greatly reduced peak reverse voltages on rectifier diodes, and simple means for limiting the peak output voltage and the peak current in all of the semiconductor components under transient conditions. These advantages are of major significance for high-power converters employing a high switching frequency(e.g., 1.8 KW and 20 kHz)."
"Pulse-position modulators are used for remote sensing of analog signals in a high-voltage constant-current dc power supply for a wideband submarine cable system. The pulse-position modulators translate the sensed analog signals into the time domain in the form of time delayed pulses. The transfer characteristics of the modulators are linearized and made insensitive to clock frequency and other sources of timing errors by use of a demodulator feedback circuit. The modulators are operated synchronously by a common clock. The clock also establishes a precisely quantized time frame which is useful in processing the modulator output signals. A variety of closed- and open-loop control functions, level monitoring functions, and both analog and digital metering functions are realized. Pulse transformers are used for dc isolation and common mode noise rejection."
 "The current capacity of a solid-state device, as ordinarily rated, varies widely depending on the current waveform, duty cycle, case temperature, etc. The underlying junction temperature limits should, however, be invariant."
"Designers of high-power circuits have not previously been able to quantitatively estimate the design tradeoffs which are available between the blocking voltage, current density, and turnoff time of a thyristor. In this paper, a new tradeoff relationship is derived by combining simple relationships from well-known device theory. The constants in this relationship are empirically adjusted to correlate with present commercial thyristors."

Results are presented that illustrate the effect of changes in important forming variables, such as the temperature of the mould, the pressing pressure, and mould lubricants, on the heat transfer. The implication of these results for the control of the heat transfer during the production of glass containers on the IS machine (the basic design of this machine was introduced in the 1920s and the bulk of glass containers produced worldwide are manufactured on this type of machine) is discussed briefly."

 "Increased emphasis on energy conservation and reduction of purchased electric power bills have resulted in an increased awareness of the importance of capacitors on industrial systems. Larger banks of capacitors are being considered for installation and many questions relating to the application must be answered. Most of the commonly encountered factors relating to equipment selection, location on the system, protection, and switching criteria are reviewed. Motor terminal capacitor applications are also discussed. Economic justification for the purchase of the capacitors and harmonic resonance, as it relates to capacitor selection and application, are not included."
"600-V insulated aluminum conductors provide excellent service in industrial installations when the wiring systems are properly designed and installed. The activities of Monsanto's Corporate Engineering Department in developing the technical data required to successfully use 600-V insulated aluminum conductors are disclosed. The developed technical data, the service results of the cable installations, and areas for future improvements are reviewed."
"A comparison is made between synchronous motors and induction motors with regard to industrial power system stability. Representation of motor loads in stability studies is reviewed. The specific system studied is an infinite bus supplying a combination induction and synchronous motor load through a transmission line and transformer. The system is subjected to a fault at the transformer and critical values of fault clearing time are computer calculated for ratios of synchronous motor load to induction motor load from zero to unity. The effect of variation of motor parameters on clearing times is discussed."
"A loaded induction motor's response to small changes in supply frequency may be described in terms of a weighting or transfer function applicable at the given steady-state operating point. An experimental method is described in which the relevant weighting function is found ``on-line'' by disturbing the system with a low level random test signal and cross correlating the appropriate input and output signals. Results obtained by the method are presented and predicted responses are compared with direct observations."
"Open-delta/open-delta and open-wye/open-delta transformer banks are often used as an economic means of supplying simultaneous single-phase and 3-phase loads in rural areas. If the 3-phase load is an induction motor, the inherent voltage unbalance causes increased losses and uneven heating that may lead to motor failure. often these motors are submersible or deep well pump motors located in remote unattended areas or air conditioning motors which may not have sufficient over-design to handle the voltage unbalance. The theory analyzing the open-delta distribution system has existed for many years, however, because of the tedious and almost infinite differences in distribution topology, the problem has been neglected. The purpose in this endeavor is to present a simple general approach to the solution of the problem by utilizing existing motor and network concepts and theories. Two previously published theories are used to predict motor heating and the motor derating that is necessary to prevent insulation failure due to the unbalanced voltages. A general motor model has been developed. Motor heating and derating are obtained from the model through a generalized digital computer program."
"The background of rising costs in the production, transmission, and distribution of electric power and energy is discussed and, in particular, the significant increases in the cost of generation.

"The speed control of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor by employing triacs in the lines which operate in the normal phase control mode is described. The inherent limitation of low circuit commutated (dv/dt), which makes the triac circuit somewhat unreliable, has been overcome by suitably designing the snubber circuit. The closed-loop speed regulation of the system is then investigated by employing digital phase-locked loop scheme. Compared to the conventional method with antiparallel SCR's and analog servo, the present scheme is somewhat simpler, more economical, and extreme precision in speed control is possible. A complete model of the speed control system has been designed and experimentally evaluated in the laboratory."
"A three-phase ac power control circuit using power transistors which operate in a high-frequency chopping mode is described. The circuit is capable of handling several kilowatts of power at any lagging load power factor angle and the output voltage can be smoothly controlled from zero to full supply voltage. The circuit has inherently fast response and the high-frequency ripple at the output is easily filtered. The development, study, and experimental evaluation of the circuit with resistive and induction motor loads is described."
"Models, derived from first principles, are presented for prediction of time-temperature responses of enclosed spaces. The proposed models are given in terms of the input energy and parameters of the room construction. Verification of the proposed models is given for the case of baseboard heating.

"An earlier paper described the use of high power thyristors in booster power supplies for glass melting. Since that time, the availability of even larger thyristors has allowed the economical design of larger power supply systems. This paper describes the design features of a 4.3-MW thyristor-controlled power-regulated glass melting power system. The system is installed on a 115-ton mixed melter furnace with bottom electrodes used in the production of opal borosilicate glass. It includes high-voltage switchgear, dual secondary power transformers, and water-cooled power cables along with the thyristor (SCR) equipment. Some information is also presented on electrode peripheral equipment, startup procedures, and a method of computing approximate circuit resistance for use in determining controller and transformer voltage and current ratings."
"The use of computer modeling with finite-difference techniques to solve for electrostatic fields by successive overrelaxation in regions where no exact analytic solution exists is well documented. However, for irregular Dirchlet boundary curves in two dimensions, which do not contain the nodes of a regular net, various interpolation schemes must be used. It is shown in this paper that these interpolation schemes introduce appreciable error into the solution for a boundary curve with a small radius of curvature, such as is found in the center of a corotron. An alternate technique is described which uses successive graded nets in the immediate region of the boundary. The validity of the method is confirmed in the case of a small wire with an applied voltage concentric with a grounded conducting cylinder, where an analytical solution is then possible. The method is then used for the solution of the Laplacian fields for a corotron having typical dimensions."
"Operation of an elastomeric blade requires the use of a boundary lubricant to remove residual xerographic toner from the photoreceptor efficiently. A radioactive tracer technique was used to study the behaviour of a number of lubricants used in the xerographic process. Both filming and nonfilming type lubricants were investigated using this technique. The results indicated that the lubricant film deposited on the photoreceptor must be in the thickness range of from 1 to 3 molecular layers for acceptable xerographic development and cleaning. Film thickness was shown to be dependent on the class of lubricant, the concentration of lubricant in toner, and the inclusion of a silica compound in the toner. Films are dynamic in nature, continuously being formed and removed during the xerographic process. Parameters affecting the filming mechanism are discussed."

"This year's Annual Meeting of the IEEE Industry Applications Society, held in Chicago, IL, USA, October, l1-14, was especially notable. The program of planned sessions for a wide range of technical interests continues to expand the annual event and to attract the attention of engineers with varied experience and responsibilities. The sessions were supplemented by inspection tours to the high-voltage test facilities of S&C Electric Companies, N.J. Conrad Laboratories; to Inland Steel's Indiana Harbor Works; and to the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratories, site of the world's largest particle accelerator. Less conspicuous, but of equal significance, were the many meetings of committees, subcommittees, and working groups contributing to the Society's activities. Of prime importance was preparation for the forthcoming reorganization of the Society into five departments to facilitate the accomplishments of the Society's goals. The General Chairman of the Eleventh Annual Meeting was Glenn R. Griffith. The Society's Outstanding Achievement Award and the Prize Papers Awards described in the following pages were presented at the Awards Luncheon. The luncheon speaker, a ficticious Doctor Hans Adolph Heinrich, gave a humorous talk which had a point nonetheless: the importance of making science understandable to the layman."
"Melting of metal in vessels powered by channel type inductors dates back to early in this century. Until recently, iron foundries requiring 5 to 10 tons of metal per hour relied upon cupolas or arc furnaces. About 15 years ago, the coreless induction furnace began to find acceptance in this field. Now improvements in the basic design of channel induction units result in an alternative to coreless furnaces, and the examples used in this paper list the comparative equipment costs and energy costs and illustrate the potential savings that can result from the use of channel melting equipment."
"A stationary mold-ingot bottom withdrawal ac consumable electrode electroslag furnace with electrode change capability has been installed for melting superalloys at Teledyne-Allvac. The furnace, which utilizes melt voltage and rms current regulation for automatic melt control and its operation are described. The stationary mold-ingot bottom withdrawal and auto-melt control concepts have proven successful and solution hardening superalloys are in routine production with high quality and good yield. Additionally, experimental melting of the nickel base and iron base precipitation hardening superalloys (containing titanium and aluminum) is in process, and initial results look encouraging with respect to quality and chemistry control."
"Contemporary cement kilns equipped with a suspension preheater provide for efficient operation with the lowest specific heat consumption. The incorporation of a flash calciner reduces the fuel requirement of the rotary kiln, thereby improving refractory life and reducing nitrogen-oxide emissions. The benefits of suspension preheat and flash calcination can be achieved in existing wet or dry process plants. Such modifications can increase kiln production while reducing the specific heat consumption. Several existing long wet and long dry kilns and suspension preheater kiln systems have been modified to flash calciner configurations."
"Some pilot studies into the removal of particulates from the exhaust of a cement plant clinker cooler are described. A two-stage electrostatic precipitator was employed, consisting of a conventional plate-wire precipitator closely followed by a three-stage grid-type precipitator, to handle 12 000 actual cubic feet per minute (acfm) of exhaust gas. To offset the high electrical resistivity of the clinker dust, moisture was added by spraying water directly onto the clinker bed in order to alleviate the problems caused by back corona. Overall collection efficiencies in excess of 90 percent were achieved, and in excess of 40 percent by the grid precipitator section alone. It is estimated on the basis of previous experience that, by using a twelve-stage grid precipitator section, overall collection efficiencies greater than 99 percent are possible. Overall treatment length would be appreciably less than for a conventional plate-wire precipitator having the same efficiency."
"For some thirty years rotary kiln operators have been looking at the possibility of employing tonnage oxygen-high-purity oxygen produced from air separation plants-to improve kiln performance. Experience has shown that because of differences in kilns, such as size, thermodynamic characteristics, and feed material, the response varies from one kiln to another. A mathematical model has now been developed which can, within reasonable limits, predict the effect of tonnage oxygen on any given kiln. Use of the model technique affords the kiln operator the opportunity to evaluate the benefits of oxygen enrichment for his particular operation."
"Many systems could be high-resistance grounded--with the traceable signal to locate the first ground fault--to result in a safe, economical, reliable, and uncomplicated method of grounding of 480-. 2400-, and 4160-V delta or wye 3-wire systems--with these benefits"
"The man in the pipeline control room (the dispatcher) is responsible for the minute by minute management of the pipeline system. He must keep the hydraulics in balance and deliver the correct product at the right time and in the right quantity at the right place. He is required to do this by operating the pipeline in its most efficient dynamic form. Small computers have made it possible to present more information to aid the dispatcher in decision making. Illustrations from many pipeline operating companies show how this new equipment is being used to speed human reaction."
"The equations which govern the discharge phenomena in neutral gas lasers are cast into simplified form which brings out the dependence of laser properties on the external parameters of importance-gas pressure, tube diameter, and tube current. The well known empirical scaling laws which govern neutral gas laser operation follow quite naturally from this procedure. Specific examples are given to illustrate agreement with experiment."

  "A laser scanner inspection machine was built to detect defects on printed wiring board gold contact fingers. The scanner sweeps a focused laser beam in raster fashion across the contacts at 60 scans/sec and the scattered beam is detected and electronically analyzed to yield the defects. Marking is accomplished with a relay-driven felt tip pen which marks the back of the board under the defective contact. The inspection of a board about four inches on a side can be done in a few seconds. A range of defects can be detected with this machine, including pinholes, gradual indentations, scratches, discolored gold, etc. The detection levels can be adjusted to pass imperfections which are not considered serious. This advantage makes the machine programmable in an objective manner, easily accommodating revisions in specifications. In this report, the operation of the machine is described including a detailed account of alignment procedures and electronic processing. Results of a preliminary test of the system effectiveness are discussed and it is shown that the level of detection must be empirically determined."
"A systematic approach to the realization of programmable sequence controllers which control the initiations of various functional operations in a plant is presented. The method is based on a partitioning of the sequence of operations into blocks such that no block contains an individual operation more than once. A formal method to obtain the partition blocks is developed. When read-only memories are used to store the sequence, a considerable reduction in storage capacity can be achieved by the method presented."

"A practical implementation is described of the use of phase-locked loop for the ontrol of a dc servomotor. Test results show that it is possible to get good performance while using cheap commercially available components, including integrated-circuit chips. Complete details of the design are given."
"A novel scheme using the operational amplifier to obtain voltage controlled time delay for triggering SCR's is discussed. The variation of the delay with voltage is smooth and undistrurbed by stray pulses. The circuit is flexible and any desired relationship between control voltage and time delay can be obtained. This has wide application in solid-state power control."
"In this paper, two control schemes are proposed and investigated for solid-state dc series motor drive. Performance characteristics such as torque speed, input harmonic content, power factor variation, and peak motor current are obtained for both control schemes and compared with the commonly used phase-angle control scheme under identical operating conditions. The input power factor is always lagging in the phase and symmetrical angle control schemes, while it is leading in extinction angle control scheme over a wide range of speed and power. Each control scheme appears to have certain merits over the other schemes. Experimental results verify the basic principles of operation and demonstrate the feasibility of these control schemes."
"The phenomenon of human eye inhibition is modeled in a solid-state sensor array system for the purpose of image edge enhancement. Three inhibition algorithms are simulated on a computer and evaluated using a uniform cross pattern as a test image. The algorithm giving the most enhancement is used in an on-line sensor array-minicomputer system. Comparison of the computer pictorial printouts using aerial positive transparencies as input images clearly shows that edges with inhibition are more pronounced than those without inhibition. Also more topographic features are recognizable in the outputs with inhibition."
"A motor speed controller is presented using digital techniques to measure, compare, and correct motor speed. In the prototype model, the range of speed control is approximately 200 rpm to 3000 rpm. The digital approach eliminates measurement nonlinearity and makes the speed setting exactly reproducible. The prototype's steady-state error is less that 0.2% of maximum speed, and it is shown how a direct extension of this design concept can easily bring steady-state error to well below 0.1% of maximum speed."
"The use of pulse width-modulated amplifiers for dc servo systems, in order to reduce the power dissipation in the output stage is proposed. The amplifier transistors can be switched in different sequences, and the amplifier will operate accordingly in three possible modes, namely the bipolar, the unipolar, and the limited unipolar modes. The principle of operation and the mathematical model for each case are described along with the special features of this amplifier which include the power dissipation in the motor and the selection of the switching frequency."
"Using a Taylor series expansion, nonlinear control systems are approximated about desired equilibrium points in state space as linear control systems. The techniques of the linear regulator problem are then used to calculate the linear state variable feedback gains needed to keep the system at the desired equilibrium point. Liapunov's second method is the basis for determining stable regions of operation about the equilibrium points. When driving the system from one equilibrium point to another, the piecewise linearization method is also used but with intermediate equilibrium points successively utilized. Enough equilibrium points are used so that the system is stable throughout the region of interest. Thus, a nonlinear system is controlled using linear state variable feedback. A small digital computer is required to implement this strategy."
"The intent of this paper is to describe, in a brief overview, a real time materials handling system currently being developed and utilized in the primary manufacturing process of tobacco at the new manufacturing complex in Richmond, Virginia. This system employs minicomputers, 32K, 16-bits and smaller, for data processing, and for material control, involving laser identification, weight determination, moisture sensing, and several mass movement techniques."
"The limitation on the range that a monostable multivibrator can be used as a frequency divider is studied and identified as due to the recovery time of the circuit. It is shown that by coupling a chain of bistable flip-flops to the mono the frequency division ratio can be increased substantially while maintaining the basic flexibility of the mono as a frequency divider. The ultimate ceiling on the variability of the hybrid divider is attributed to the small timing jitter of the mono."
"An exact representation of the multiplying property of a binary rate multiplier (BRM) is derived. The equations are in a simple matrix form with a common multiplier matrix, the order and elements of which are easily predicted for BRM's of any given bit magnitude. Equations are developed for particular input constraints and may be combined when more than one input constraint condition exists. The equations are of a form which is particularly useful in the analysis of digital feedback systems using BRM's."
"This paper discusses a hierarchical computer network for monitoring and controlling experimental processes. The computer network consists of micro and minicomputers for interfacing a variety of experiments to the network, a medium scale process control computer for data reduction and formatting, and a communications control computer to link the network to a large scale digital computer for processing experimental data. Some of the hardware and software requirements at each level of the network are discussed. The application of the network is illustrated with experiments operating at different levels in the network."
"In the design of permanentic machines for control applications the calculation of leakage permeance can be determined by considering the contribution from the various leakage paths. The method of determining leakage permeance is described in some detail and its use in the optimum design of permanent magnet machines is indicated."
"A new approach to digital measurements of angular velocity for control applications is discussed. An optical transducer is described which provides a pulse rate. The pulse period is measured and the division of time is achieved by either a general purpose or a special purpose processor. Since sampling intervals are small, measurements are available in digital form almost immediately. Other advantages include the capability to measure transient angular velocity characteristics and the accurate measurement of angular velocity near zero. With modifications the system can be transformed into an accelerometer."
"This paper deals with a digital computer-simulation study of a complex drive-system which incorporates a thyristor cycloconverter-type frequency-converter in the rotor circuit of a slip-ring induction motor for speed variation in the subsynchronous as well as the supersynchronous region by secondary voltage control The action of the frequency converter is analogous to that of a normal commutator in the stator-fed ac commutator motor while the circuit behavior is similar to that of a cycloconverter. A rotor-position detector is used to switch the thyristor configuration in a sequential manner to generate an output voltage having a predominant slip-frequency component. Simulation involves solution of a set of generalized performance equations of an ideal induction machine in an appropriate reference frame under the control conditions imposed by the thyristor-commutator which is simulated using simple logical and limiting statements. Differential equations are solved by the well-known Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. Initial simulation results assuming thyristors as ideal switches and neglecting source impedances show very similar characteristics to the case when a pure sine-wave slip-frequency voltage is injected to the rotor. Rigorous simulation results include the physical thyristor behavior, effect of source impedances, overlap, and logical control of the circulating currents that may occur. Simulation results are presented together with the experimental performance of the drive."
"The main problem in the analysis of chopper-fed dc series is due to the interdependence of armature induced voltage and the armature current and the fact that the relation between the two is nonlinear. The different aspects of analysis such as performance equations, methods of their solution, and the representation of nonlinear magnetization characteristics of the dc series motor are described. The calculated performance has been compared with the measured results."
"A technique is discussed which can be used to simulate the very high average power environment encountered when high power switches are operated in a repetitively pulsed mode. An operational test facility is described which has been used to test spark gap switches at voltages up to 80 kV, pulse repetition rates up to 500 pps, and simulated average power levels of several megawatts. The power consumed in the test facility depends on the power simulated and the voltages used in the test circuit. Typically, the electrical duty experienced by a switch transferring several megawatts average power can be provided with a few hundred kilowatts average power using the simulation concept described here."

  "In order to better characterize the capacitance discharge welding operation, a stress wave emission (SWE) model has been devised. The transfer function existing between the welding' power supply and the SWE detector is found. From the impulse response of the transfer function, it is shown that the welding operation and SWE detection are linear (almost) time invariant processes."
"This paper deduces the expressions for the commutating capacitor voltage and current during the commutation period of the main and auxiliary thyristor in a chopper for a dc motor control system. After a successful commutation, a certain amount of energy is ``stored'' in the circuit components, and for best component utilization this stored energy has to be minimized. The procedure of minimum stored energy in the commutation circuit has resulted in the selection of optimum values of commutating capacitors and inductors, and the values so obtained are more precisely defined than those indicated by early workers."
"Presented is a converter philosophy for controlled transfer and transformation of electric energy through internal series resonant circuits at high internal power frequencies in excess of 10 kHz. Control of the continuously oscillating high Q series resonant circuit is attained by adjustment of the phase angle ψr between the exciting voltage and the resonant current. Only a very small fraction of the energy transferred to the load is absorbed by the resonant circuits to replace the power dissipated therein. Moderate and unconditionally predictable voltage and current stresses on components result from definite control of static and dynamic behavior of the system. This system is suited for construction of failsafe and highly efficient, low cost, submegawatt, single module converters with currently available components."
"A type of industrial size dc converter for submegawatt applications is described and illustrated with the characteristics of a small scale 10 kW model. High conversion efficiency near 97 percent is maintained at full power and with an internal frequency of operation near 10 kHz. The system is characterized by the behavior of a true current source with inherent short circuit capability of its output terminals. All power is processed via a firmly controlled high Q series resonant circuit. Feasibility of power densities in excess of 1 kW/kg component weight is demonstrated. This high power density reflects itself in low quantities of material needed for construction of these systems. Operation of the dc converter as part of a rectifier-filter converter system, powered from a three-phase supply line is described. Test data demonstrate a high power factor PF≃0.95 for all conditions of converter loading. Data obtained from a thyristor bridge-filter system are presented and subjected to comparative analysis."
"A circuit configuration is suggested for oscillators which use CMOS ICs. Standard ICs containing three inverting amplifier stages allow inexpensive construction of oscillators containing automatic output amplitude control. The output is sinusoidal with relatively low distortion and the crystal power is low. The total number of components and cost are competitive with common two transistor oscillators."
"The results of an investigation of the relations between various important parameters of a picture making model are presented. Temporal and spatial perturbations are used to control the distribution of energy on film. The necessary relations that must be satisfied in order to achieve sharply defined edges and uniform energy distributions in dark areas are obtained."
"A closed-loop control system to reduce the reactive power required by electronic converters is proposed. The instantaneous reactive power which consists of both displacement of fundamental current and harmonic distortion current is measured and compensated by a reactive power source connected parallel between the power lines and the converter. A combination of a dc choke and a forced-commutated inverter is used for the reactive power source."
"The paper describes a brushless alternator arrangement in which the conventionally used rotating diodes are replaced by thyristors. To preserve the brushless principle, the firing signals are transmitted optically from a stationary source to a single shaft-mounted light-sensitive diode, which feeds a simple transistorized amplifier and a decoding circuit. Light pulses to the diode are coded in such a way that each thyristor is addressed in an appropriate sequence with a firing signal. The considerable improvement brought about by the new excitation system is illustrated by a comparison of the transient performance of a 10 kVA alternator, when excited by conventional and by rotating-thyristor means."
"The effect of forced-commutation on the ac phase controller with a series resistance-inductance load has been investigated. It has been shown that the total circuit power factor can exceed that of the load to sinusoidal current, with selected firing angles. Two modes of switching are introduced in which one maintains the fundamental power factor to near unity despite the load being largely inductive. In the second the fundamental power factor is kept to its most leading value and a relative improvement in distortion factor is achieved."
"Two methods for steady-state analysis of SCR controlled three-phase induction motor are described in the paper. The first method uses the dynamic model of the motor arranged in state space form. The second method uses the steady-state harmonic equivalent circuits of the motor. The results obtained by these methods are compared."
"This paper describes the analysis and design of a servo system which contains distributed (mechanical) elements. Those elements not only insert delay but also act as loads whose behavior can be explained by the transmission line theory. The theory was used to obtain the frequency responses necessary for the Bode design method. Excellent agreement was obtained between predicted and measured results."

"Efficient encoding schemes for partitioning the control Read-Only Memory (ROM) of a microprogrammed digital controller into the composition of smaller ROM matrices are given in this paper. Based on these partition methods, we propose an economical way of implementing the hybrid redundant structure in a microprogrammed control for enhancing fault-tolerant control operations. The approach greatly reduces the control memory requirements, improves the ROM encoding efficiency and facilitates microprogram debugging and fault detection capabilities in the ROM's."
"The advent of microprocessors has added a new dimension to process measurement and control. Nuclear instrumentation has not been excluded. One system which has recently been introduced is an out-of-core detector system. This system provides continuous monitoring of the axial power distribution using four-section excore detectors. The microprocessor allows the system to be self-contained and provides the functions of data collection and analysis not possible through analog techniques. The hardware and software developed to achieve an intelligent monitoring system is presented."

This plant adopts completely centralized control system and man-machine interfaced computing control. After short test running, the plant has been operated successfully by 7 operators per shift with the daily products of up to 800 tons."
"Automated manufacturing processes are frequently controlled by a centralized mini-computer which monitors system status and controls individual machines using parameters such as temperature, number of rejected units, etc. Systems of this nature suffer from inflexibility in that expansion or other changes require re-programming of the control computer. GARD has devised a control system called PACER which permits increased flexibility through decentralized control. Each machine is individually controlled by its own microprocessor; expanding or modifying the system is thus greatly simplified."
"A digitally controlled cycloconverter excitation system for a laboratory size two-axis synchronous machine is described. The control strategies for start up, steady synchronous and asynchronous operations are provided. The possibility of the use of a microprocessor to replace the hard wired logic and further increase the excitation system flexibility is detailed."
"As a result of protracted delays encountered to obtain approval for the construction of nuclear and fossil units, and the long lead time to construct these, (approximately 10 years) the Consolidated Edison Co. of New York was compelled to purchase some 100 gas turbine generators with a total capacity of about 2700MW to meet our load demands for the early 1970 period. Within a 3-year period, we were thus able to add approximately 30% additional generation capacity to our system. While these gas turbines were designed primarily to meet peak demands, our system load requirements from 1971 to 1974 were at a level which necessitated continuous operation of these during the major portion of the day."

"This paper describes a microprocessor-based subsystem which was developed to provide a statistical description of the diameter of an arbitrary length of wire during the drawina or insulation process. The instrument, built around a 4-bit Intel microprocessor, computes the mean and standard deviation of 1000 data samples over a length of wire determined by the setting on a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) thumbwheel switch. The sample period may be varied from 2 milliseconds to 10 seconds. The statistical quantities are output on analog channels as well as digital displays. In addition to the statistical computation, the instrument has the option of playing back the data at arbitrary speeds and generatinq histograms of the data samples. The techniques described in this paper can be inexpensively implemented to provide a statistical description of many laboratory or production processes with a minimum of operator intervention."

"A variable frequency, variable amplitude three-phase low frequency sine wave reference generator is discussed in this paper. The frequency and amplitude are independently capable of being varied by means of two independent dc control voltages. This reference generator is well suited for closed loop control applications such as constant frequency power supplies, constant amplitude power supplies, induction motor control requiring a finite ratio between amplitude and frequency, etc. The reversal of polarity of the dc voltage controlling the frequency reverses the phase sequence. The reference generator has been very satisfactorily used in the control of a three-phase ``subharmonic'' pulse width modulated inverter. The reference generator is also suitable for cycloconverter control."
"The paper continues the study of a constant frequency triggered, thyristor equipped bistable circuit operating in the long time regime [2]. Now the circuit behaviour is examined in the initial regime, i.e., when a limited number of trigger pulses are applied. By considering ideal thyristors and an ideal voltage supply, expressions are deduced for the instantaneous and final voltages across the commutating capacitor, for the reverse biasing times of the turning off thyristors, for the minimal number of trigger pulses at which in the circuit with a good approximation, establishes the long time regime."
"An original time-optimal system of a stepping motor is discussed. The proper switching moment for each phase of the motor is dependent on the normalized mechanical velocity wM, the normalized electromagnetic time constant Te and the normalized internal damping ration."
"The paper discusses a generalized procedure for obtaining on line programmable control of furnace temperature using model simulation techniques. Part I presents the procedure for developing a mathematical model of a furnace and the associated experimental results. Part II discusses the simulation models of various blocks of the system and presents the experimental verification for on line programmable temperature control of a furnace."
"In high power diode switching applications where overdrive is necessary, it is difficult to incorporate a short circuit feature in the driving circuitry. In this paper, a high power PIN diode driver with built-in protecting network based on a self-timing mode is described. The self-timing network is monitoring the output voltage and if a short exists, after a reverse-bias switching is completed, it acts to deviate the base current from the output driving device and reduces the load current by a few orders of magnitude. During every forward-bias to reverse-bias transition, the timing network introduces a delay to avoid interference with the normal operation of the circuit. The described driving circuit is suitable in systems where a plurality of such drivers may be used or in testing instrumentation."
"This paper describes a microcomputer programming facility, using an ``in-house'' minicomputer system which is capable of programning PROMs automatically from microprocessor source code. A programming system is described which contains cross-assemblers for Intel microcomputers and 1702A PROMs."
"A function generator based on the ultraviolet-light-erasable, programmable read-only memory (PROM) was developed. The generator can-generate a step-wise approximation to any arbitrary single-valued functional relation between an input signal and an output signal, or between an output signal and time. The input signal or the output signal can be a digital voltage, an analog voltage, or a current. The generator can be expanded by adding several PROMs to obtain more bits of resolution in either the input or the output signal, and it is compatible with either computer or manual control."
"The application of a minicomputer is investigated for the on-line estimation of the parameters of a two-stage heat-exchanger from the samples of the input and output data with the system under operation. Two methods for on-line identification are considered, and the minicomputer is also used for monitoring all the measurements. The results indicate that not only is it possible to update the estimates during the sampling interval, but there is considerable time available for control purposes as well."
"Sensors impact on the electronics industry is growing because of its close connection with process control in manufacturing as well as with entertainment goods and automotive industry. Therefore new sensors and new applications of well known sensors have been developed. The present situation and future prospects are here examined, emphasizing that in this field scientific, technical and economic interests flow together. These interests have already today, but more so will have in the future, an accelerating effect all over industrial development."
"A low-cost digital controller is described for use in the generation of lithographic patterns with a scanning electron microscope, for microcircuit fabrication over 100 um x 100 um pattern fields. Resolution of the writing system is set by the microscope and not by the external control circuitry. Fabrication procedures and results are given for test patterns in which minimum line widths of about 0.5 um were attained."
 "Provides instructions and guidelines to prospective authors who wish to submit manuscripts."
  "A design method which extends linear design techniques to nonlinear control systems design using an on-line digital computer is described. A linearization technique and a control design technique suitable for implementation on-line are described. The method is illustrated on a 10th order 2 input 2 output system. The method allows use of well-known classical design techniques such as series compensation while gaining the advantages of state variable feedback."
"Precision data reduction and transformation from stereo aerial photographs can sometimes require a number of photogrammetric instruments operating together in real time. When some of these instruments are at times peripheral to a central one and at other times operated off line it is convenient to have them self contained with special purpose fixed program computing hardware, examples of which are discussed."
"The application of the primary discrete prediction filter to the feedback in the control system of NC servomotor by the microcomputer, is evaluated. The minimum sampling time permissive is 3 msec for the velocity control and 12 msec for the position control. The contribution of the prediction in the velocity loop is seen. The prediction in the position loop is useful. The larger velocity gain is permitted when the prediction coefficient in the velocity loop is approximately 0.82. The larger velocity gain causes the greater immunity from the torque disturbance."
"Relations between attenuation and phase shift of electromagnetic waves passing through a wet substance and weights of water and dry substance have been used for calculation of the real value of moisture content of the substance. The result appears to be independent of the denity of the substance, its layer thickness and flatness of its surface. Measuring set-up for continuous measurement requires some extensions when compared with a single-parameter measuring set-up, but it is still supplied by a oscillator working at one constant frequency and it consists of only one sensor."
"The mixed method of Shieh and Wei which utilizes the dominant-eigenvalue concept and the continued fraction approach is extended to the z domain to simplify z domain-transfer-function matrices with various dimensions. The reduced model is always stable and the dominant performance of the original system is retained."
"A ballast circuit employing a constant current diode and a vacuum tube that can provide a constant current over a voltage range of 1000 volts. The simple circuit can prove useful in studying voltage breakdown characteristics."
"Digital electronic schemes for chopping the error contained in the output of normalized analog adders are described in this paper. We first analyze the error contents and then demonstrate the proposed digital chopper with depth discussions on the experimental results obtained."
"A new method for the generation of the multifunction operation W = sign(X).Z(X/Y)m is treated in this paper. The method is based on logarithmic function generation by means of logarithmic pulse width modulation, which is pulse width modulation with an exponential carrier signal (Ye-αXt). Demodulation is done by feeding the pulse width modulated signal into an integrator which has a logarithmic pulse width modulator in its feedback path. This feedback pulse width modulator has an exponential carrier signal of the form Ze-αWt. Moreover, this logarithmic pulse width modulator in the feedback path also performs the antilog operation. Hence, multifunction operation is accomplished based on the log-antilog principle. The exponent m is equal to the ratio of the inverse of the time constants of the exponential carrier signals for the input and feedback modulators (m = αw/αx).Hence, the exponent m can easily be adjusted. Experiments on the analog computer showed that an accuracy of 0.2% of a 1 V full scale was easily obtainable. The frequency response and the signal-to-noise ratio of the system was determined through simulation on a digital computer."
"The paper describes the design, construction and testing of a closed-loop system for the speed control of a separately excited d.c. motor fed from a dual converter. The dual converter makes possible regenerative braking and reversal of direction of rotation. There is only one firing unit and the firing pulses are diverted to the appropriate converter by a master controller. There are three control loops: one for armature current control, one for adjusting the firing angle of the oncoming converter, and one for speed control."
"This paper develops the theory necessary for controlling a linear system so that certain variables follow a prescribed path perfectly while the others track in an optimal fashion. The resulting control consists of feedforward and feedback portions. The results are demonstrated via a nonlinear example."
"A force angle measurement device capable of measuring the displacement between the fundamental fields established by the linear synchronous motor (LSM) vehicle magnets and the three phase track is described. The paper indicates that the force angle is fundamental to the understanding of the LSM steady state and transient behaviour and effective operation will necessarily include control of this angle. Tests on a small model facility show the device operating over a 360°range. Results are shown for the vehicle during steady state and transient conditions."
"In this paper the performances and construction characteristics of a medium power step motor are analyzed, and some suitable techniques for its supply and control are explained. These techniques serve to obtain the best performance in a way that guarantees the correspondence between control impulses and step made. Then the performance characteristic of motor-supply-control are compared to those of dc motor with independent excitation circuits."
"The measurement of vertical component S of stresses tensor during soil compaction [1] is required not only for scientific but also for industrial applications."
"A precision resistive temperature sensor for the region -30° to +180° C is described. This thermistor of intrinsic single crystalline germanium features small size (even miniaturization), very short response time, low capacitance and inherent narrow tolerances in characteristic resistance and temperature sensitivity (tracking). The latter features are due to the precise definition of intrinsic conductivity together with special electrode systems which, by concentrating the field, render the outer dimensions of the thermistor chip ineffective."
"An automatic phase control system adapted for the modulated subcarrier method of the microwave signal attenuation measurements is described."
"A high field strength hysteresigraph deriving H directly from the mains is described. The coil is energised only during one and one-half cycles of the main frequency to produce the high field. The present unit is intended for testing several soft and fairly hard (e.g., magnetic tape) materials. The hysteresigraph consists of a zero cross over detector, a programmable timer, a high current switch and a magnetising coil. This novel design concept eliminates the use of the conventional and costly capacitor discharge system. In the present design a low cost triac has been used to switch peak current pulses of 200 amperes. A maximum pulsed field strength of 20,000 oersteds has been realised. However, the same design concept can be extended to realise much higher field strengths when a triac of higher current rating is used in the same circuit."
"In this work we present an application of an electronic prediction circuit for the speed-up of flow measurements with thermistors. The matching between the circuit and thermistors is studied and some considerations are presented on the enhancement of the bandwidth of thermistor anemometer. Operating conditions are suggested in order to optimize the dynamic behavior of the system."
"A new phase-angle monitor is presented in this paper which can simultaneously measure the phase-angle between two signals and identify their lead-lag characteristics once every cycle. A novel phase-sequence detector is also described which can detect periodic and aperiodic sequence of pulses once in each cycle. Sequential logic circuit designs for these have been synthesized and tested in the laboratory. The inherent simplicity of these circuits particularly using digital integrated circuits and their adaptability in power system instrumentation and control are the novel features of the paper."
"The problem of obtaining discrete representations of continuous systems is addressed. This topic is important in the area of digital simulation and also in the design of digital controllers to replace continuous controllers. A frequency-domain design procedure is presented and applied to an autopilot example. The technique appears to be very promising for linear systems."
"A new model of the process for producing images on film from a light-emitting diode array is presented. Unlike its predecessor [1], the irradiance distribution is allowed to be arbitrary; yet, the desirable property of uniform energy distribution on film corresponding to dark areas in the original digital image is retained."
"Boron thermistors have been prepared by a new technique involving the chemical vapour deposition of boron on crossed molibdenum wires. The paper describes the conditions of deposition pertaining to the thermal reduction of boron trichloride in a hydrogen atmosphere and sets out the special advantages offered by the crossed-wire arrangement, which not only inables a thermistor structure (including the leads) to be obtained in a single operation, but also affords control over the final value of the resistance of the device, thus making it possible to achieve low tolerances of this parameter."
"A set of dynamic filtering and prediction equations for use on a large scale gas pipe-line network are obtained on the basis of a simplified model. An algorithmic approach enables the filter to be structured and initialised automatically to particular applications on the input of commonly available network parameters. The proposed algorithm has relatively modest computational requirements. The response of the simplified dynamic network equations to a standard demand flow profile compares favourably with that previously obtained using a more complicated model. Simulation results illustrating filter performance to be satisfactory are also given."
"Preliminary tests on small quantities of sand with varying moisture content using a capacitive probe yielded reliable data as to the percentage of moisture. These tests indicate that the design of the monitoring system is feasible, provided that further tests are carried out and that an actual full-scale system be evaluated."

 "Degradation was observed in optically coupled isolators that were operated under both photodiode and phototransistor biasing configurations. The device \"on\" state current decreased during operation due to degradation of the light emitting diode radiant power output. This decrease in radiant power output was associated with an increase in the nonradiative, space charge recombination current component of the light emitting diode forward current. In addition, large and rapid increases were observed in the optically coupled isolator \"off\" state currents. This degradation was due to formation of a surface inversion channel in the base region of the photosensitive transistor."
"The reliability of Integrated Injection Logic (I2L) or Merged Transistor Logic (MTL) circuits fabricated in a standard bipolar technology with Ti-Pt-Au interconnection is reported. The study is based on accelerated stress aging and actual field results. Experiments are described which demonstrate that I2L circuit failure in humid ambients due to Au elelctrolysis will not occur because of low voltage operation. Failure rates less than 10 FITs for an LSI part (.001% failure per 1000 device hours) under normal stress over a 40 year life are predicted for the main population by accelerated bias temperature and bias humidity stress. Well behaved current gain (ßu) under bias temperature step stress indicates that Ou degradation will not be a significant failure mechanism. At this writing, more than 60 million device hours have been accumulated for LSI chips in specific applications with no reported chip failures. This field result firmly supports accelerated stress reliability predictions."
"The development of charge on the dielectric surface of junction isolated monolithic SICs can result in significant reductions in operating life. The transient and steady state characteristics of IC failure caused by the development of charge on the dielectric surface have been studied under room ambient conditions by monitoring the current through the inversion layer formed between circuit components of like conductivity type. The results of this study indicate that this IC failure mechanism is sensitive to IC layout geometry and suggest that conservative junction isolated monolithic SIC designs should have an inversion threshold voltage greater than the operating voltage."
"Potential reliability effects due to a profusion of hot electrons generated by a parasitic bipolar have been identified in short channel N-type IGFET devices. An explanation of the phenomenon as well as a mathematical and circuit model for the effects are presented. Results from the model will be used to predict changes in device characteristics with time."
"With over 100,000 hours of reliability testing of complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices built on sapphire substrates, a pattern of failure mechanisms has emerged. Not surprisingly, the well known gate oxide charge instabilities and gate oxide shorts commonly found in CMOS are also present in this latest technology innovation. The sapphire technology has added to these failure mechanisms several problems related to the input protective network and the so called back-channel leakage current stemming from the silicon-sapphire interface."
"The ability to open or bridge selected conductors on an L.S.I. chip opens up a wide range of analytical opportunities in the field of failure analysis, design debugging, and commercial device analysis. Simple methods of severing, repairing and interconnecting conductors in high density L.S.I. silicon chips are described. The design details of a simple precision tool serving the dual functions of microsurgery and subsequent electrical probing of components is discussed. Results obtained with the methods described on various commercial & custom L.S.I. circuits are presented."
"Under certain bias conditions, electrons flowing through the channel of an n-channel IGFET can be injected into the gate insulator. A fraction of the injected electrons is trapped in the dielectric, producing a shift in device operating characteristics. This phenomenon is minimized by proper device design. A model is described to predict long-term shifts from accelerated stress test data."
"Surface impurities are an important factor that affects the reliability of semiconductor devices exposed to THB environments. Aluminum metallized specimens were intentionally contaminated with controlled amounts of Na, K, and Cl. Corrosion was observed at both the anode and cathode following THB tests. The corrosion rate was proportional to the log of the impurity concentration. A model is proposed to explain the observed corrosion processes."
"The results of an experimental study of beryllium and beryllium-aluminum alloys as high reliability advanced metallizations for use on semiconductor devices is presented. Methods for the deposition of thin films and the properties of these films are described and the application of these metallizations to actual devices is discussed. In addition, since beryllium can be a toxic material, precautions necessary for its use are detailed."
"The effects of gold aluminum intermetallic growth on the stability of interconnects to thin film hybrid microcircuits were studied. Three different metallization systems were evaluated using three types of bonding wire. Tantalum-nitride-chromium-gold was bonded using 0.031 mm alurminum 1% Si wire and 0.031 mm aluminum 1% Mg wire. These two wire types were also bonded to substrates metallized with tantalum-nitride titanium-palladium-gold. Also, gold wire (0.025 mm) was bonded to aluminum metallization. These metallization-bond systems were evaluated by subjecting the tests specimens to various known temperatures and time environments followed by loop pull tests to destruction, bond shear tests to destruction, and four-point probe electrical resistance measurements. The environments included: 1. 1000 hrs. of storage at 100°C, 200°C, and 300°C. 2. Temperature cycling from -40°C to 200°C for 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 cycles. The data shows that the electrical resistance shows drastic increases long before mechanical integrity is degraded. It was not uncommon to see kilohms. The results of aging of gold wire bonding to aluminum metallized substrates is described. Stabilized and unstabilized wire were used, and the effects of time and temperature on bond integrity are reported. Both were types degraded mechanically and electrically with little differences between the two."
"A study is made of the intermetallics which form when aluminum wire is ultrasonically joined to thin and thick film gold metallizations and stored for extended times at moderate temperatures. Conclusions are reached concerning the effects of conductor surface topography, thickness, and purity on bond reliability."
"The morphology and microstructural characteristics of Al-wire bond to Au metallization in microsubstrates was investigated by SEM, electron probe and Auger spectroscopy. It is shown that the ultrasonic bonding creates an interaction zone about 5 μm deep. Low bond strength and failure of the bond after H2 soldering cycle is attributed to impurities in the Au inks. These impurities form brittle intermetallics with Al and brittle, readily reducible, low melting glasses."
"An in-line laser interferometer was developed to study motions during ultrasonic bonding. The interferometer consists of a 2 milliwatt He-Ne laser with output mirrors at both ends, a lens with adjustment apparatus, and a photodiode detector. The detector output is displayed on an oscilloscope. The lens permits the beam to be focussed to a spot diameter less than 25 micrometers. The beam is focussed on a periodically moving target which results in a fringe pattern displayed on the oscilloscope. Peak-to-peak displacements up to 50 micrometers have been measured with an accuracy of ± 25 nanometers. The fringe pattern observed may be described in terms of a Michelson interferometer. The experimentally observed fringe pattern corresponds exactly to the theoretical plot using the Michelson interferometer. Peak-to-peak displacements are determined by counting the number of fringes on the oscilloscope."
"The use of Acoustic Emission (AE) in a test for beam lead bond integrity has been investigated. AE refers to emission of broad band stress waves when materials are broken, cracked, or deformed. A major problem in the present work was to develop means of nondestructively stressing the delicate, irregularly extending beam leads. The most promising of the methods developed are a silicone rubber (SR) pull test, a push down test on SR encapsulated devices, and various probe methods of applying force to the beams without contacting the chip. AE bursts from weak bonds or beam anchors are detected with a substrate detector operating at 375 kHz or a probe detector operating at 1.1 MHz or both. The study has revealed considerable differences in the mechanical integrity of beam lead bond-anchor systems. General deterioration of the beam-anchor system begins at pull forces per beam of from approximately 1.0 to 2.5 gf, depending on the manufacturer's procedure. The forces applied to the beam-anchor system for all methods of stressing, except the pull test, are dependent upon the shape of the individual beams as they extend from the chip, as well as the uniformity of the bugging height. There are many other potential uses of AE in electronics, such as to insure the bonding integrity of flip chips, capacitor chips in hybrids, and bonds on automated tape-bonded integrated circuits. The latter two uses were experimentally demonstrated in the present work."
"Ultrasonic wire bonding is a dynamic process which has been found to introduce material damage to improperly protected silicon. Damage is detected through the generation of steam oxidation induced stacking faults in the silicon after the metal and oxides have been removed. Silicon of both (100) and (111) orientations were evaluated with faulting being found predominately on those (111) planes whose lines of interesection with the surface were most nearly perpendicular to the applied direction of ultrasonic motion. Stacking faults predominate at the outer periphery of the bond. In addition to a correlation between the direction of ultrasonic motion and the fault planes observed, different fault planes operate at the toe and heel of the bond. No stacking faults are induced for normal ultrasonic bonding parameters and standard thicknesses of metallization (10 KÅ) using 2-mil bonding wire. This method of analysis provides a means for evaluating changes in materials and processing to improve bond reliability."
"Part I of this paper describes a facility which has recently been developed to conduct accelerated life tests on-printed wiring products. Procedures developed for the evaluation of flexible printed circuits are outlined, and a representative set of life test data is reviewed to illustrate the kinds of information obtainable with this facility. In conducting accelerated life tests on fineline flexible printed circuits coated with UV-cured resins, failures have been observed to occur in virtually every part of the circuit structure. In Part II, the various failure modes are described and are categorized according to the principal structural element involved (e.g., cover-coat, substrate, etc.). In many cases environmental domains have been identified, within which there is a clear predominance of a specific failure mode."
"Knowledge of thermo-mechanical strains in plated-through holes, complemented by an understanding of failure mechanics, yields valuable information about the effect of materials, design and process parameters on product reliability potential. A technique is described for measuring central barrel strain and surface land rotation for plated-through-holes during thermal transients."
"A simple model is described which provides a basic understanding of the relationship between the thermo-mechanical deformations of a plated-through-hole and the consequent principal failure modes of the PTH structure. The model facilitates the design of effective reliability test programs and the interpretation of experimental results."
"The principal thermo-mechanical failure modes of a plated-through-hole structure are described and the major factors contributing to such failures are discussed in mechanistic terms. This leads to the development of an improved methodology for evaluating the reliability of plated-through-holes."
"Thermally induced cracks can occur at the interface between land and PTE barrel, hence, a measure of electrical continuity of the interface connection is important in product quality assessment and reliability projection. Series circuits with poor resolution are generally used to monitor circuit integrity during thermal tests. A much more sensitive method of measuring the interface directly is described."
"The influence of voltage and current probe connections on the detection of barrel cracks and similar flaws in plated through holes is discussed. Theoretical calculation of the sensitivity of a four point resistance measurement to the length of a barrel crack is compared to experimental results for a variety of current voltage probe configurations."
"Simulated thermal stress stimuli are used for reliability testing and quality assessment of printed wiring products. Heat transfer is discussed in terms of internal conduction and measured surface convection coefficients encountered during manufacture and testing. The fluidized particulate bath is discussed as an attractive medium for applying thermal stress stimuli."
"The dielectric absorption (DA) of capacitors with various dielectrics has been studied by the use of Thermally Stimulated Discharge (TSD). It has been shown that this test gives a much more accurate measurement of DA and in addition gives information about the mechanism of absorption. The charge determined by TSD has been correlated with noise which reduces the reliability of the capacitors in high gain circuits."
"A radiographic method has been devised and successfully applied to the detection of delaminations in small ceramic-chip capacitors. The results indicate that this nondestructive technique is suitable for sampling or 100% screening of lots. The radiograph provides an integrated image of internal structure rather than a view of just one plane as in cross sectioning. It requires proper alignment of chips in the x-ray beam, and readily detects voids of at least 0.001-inch width that extend more than 30% of the depth of the capacitor. Life tests of radiographically graded parts showed a high correlation with physical-sectioning results and with capacitor failure rates."
 "(1) Conduction electrons in nichrome have a short mean-free path. This maximizes E2R heating and precludes electromigration in the direction of electron flow as a fusing mechanism. (2) Transmission electron microscopy is the only effective analytical tool to characterize the programmed fuse gap structure. (3) Nichrome fuses program by molten metal (nickel, chrome) ions moving in the presence of an electric field. The final structure resembles a frozen splash and is described by fluid dynamics. (4) Thermal analysis coupled with empirical programmed fuse data indicate a threshold power density for fusing. If this power density is exceeded, which can be assured if the programming time utilized is as specified, the fuse gap will be wide and reliable. If this power density threshold is only matched, it is possible to create a marginal fuse. (5) Life test results indicate programmed PROM reliability is equivalent to devices of the same complexity that do not utilize fusible links."
 "There has been an increasing interest in recent months in the dual dielectric metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) cell as a nonvolatile semiconductor memory element. A true nonvolatile semiconductor memory could replace the omnipresent magnetic memory because associated with it one also expects fast access capability as well as interface compatibility with other semiconductor logic circuits. Key features in such a semiconductor memory cell, then are; true nonvolatility, high-speed access capability and ease of write-erase operations. The development of the dual-dielectric charge-storage (DDC) cells have followed two parallel paths, both enjoying a limited success yielding commercial products. The first centers around the concept of the floating gate, an artificially created metallic charge-storage site located at the dual dielectric interface. The second uses the naturally occurring interfacial states existing at the dual-dielectric interface as the charge storage sites, as in metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (MNOS) memory transistors. The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches to the realization of DDC cells is reviewed briefly. And then the concept of the interfacial dopants, l the heart of this paper, emerges as a particularly beneficial compromise between these two concepts, resulting in an optimum DDC cell, with true nonvolatility, yet with undemanding write-eras conditions."
"Reliability aspects of polycrystalline silicon fusible link PROM's have been investigated and discussed in terms of manufacturing and accelerated lifetesting. lifetest data indicate that the \"grow back\" failure made operative in nichrome fuse PROM's is not present in polysilicon fuses. Failure rates associated with the fuse structure are considerably below the inherent failure rate of the bipolar device."
"Since the introduction of the FAMOS PROM structure and its implementation in a 2048 bit P-Channel MOS PROM, few device reliability data have been available. This paper presents data taken on both the P-Channel 2048 bit FAMOS PROM and the 8192 bit N-Channel FAMOS PROM. The reliability studies undertaken fall into two categories, PROM retention tests and integrated circuit reliability tests. The combination of tests employed provide the basis for activation energy and failure rate calculations."
"Occasionally a problem becomes a solution. In search of a reliable element to use as the electrically alterable storage element in a programmable read only memory (PROM), the well-known failure mode of the shorted semiconductor junction was studied. Since a shorted junction is easily produced and remains shorted indefinitely, it can be applied as a reliable PROM storage element. This paper describes the programming technique and summarizes over four years of reliability characterizations performed on actual PROM devices produced using this technique."
"Design factors affecting the reliability of Schottky T2L PROMs are discussed with special attention to the high voltage programming circuitry and fuse design. Key process controls during nichrome deposition, fuse delineation (masking) and subsequent processing environments have been developed as a result of device failure analysis. Approaches to functional and AC testing before actual progranming are detailed with respect to the use of additional test \"bit\" and \"word\" lines and device design layout. One pulse programming of extra test fuses in each device is used as a special manufacturing screen to remove would be failures. \"User\" liabilities involved in programming, testing and Hi-Rel processing are explored with emphasis on long term reliability."
 "With a view to preventing the formation of parasitic MOS in plastic encapsulated MOS devices, we studied the mechanism of the formation and found that parasitic MOS is due not only to surface mobile charge on oxidized silicon but also to bulk charge in plastic materials. Concerning an epoxy resin for semiconductor use, which is the most widely used material for plastic encapsulation, the behavior of bulk charge under pressure was investigated by electrical measurement and that under application of high voltage dc was also investigated electrically and by EPMA analysis. As a result, it was established that the majority of the mobile charge is actually certain ions with a negative charge and containing chlorine, rather than electrons or dipoles. It was further confirmed that parasitic MOS formation is extremely scant in MOS devices encapsulated with the same type of epoxy resins with little hydrolyzable chloride ion, and hence that minimizing the ionizable component in plastic materials is highly effective in preventing parasitic MOS formation. Motion of charge along the interface between silicon oxide layer and plastic could not be clarified. However, it is thought that parasitic MOS formation due to this motion can be prevented by providing an appropriate guard ring."
"Special n-channel FET memory chips with non-random, purposely etched passivation defects are used to ascertain the effect of incompletely cured polyimide on the product's functional reliability. Polyimide Is applied to the chip's surface and cured at 300°C for five minutes. This cure results in approximately 95% linkage formation as ascertained from IR spectrum analysis. Subsequently, the product Is broken Into four groups and further \"cured\" at 225°C for 0 (controls), 5, 25, and 50 hours, respectively. These samples are then put on life stress at 40, 85, and 130°C. For the control case, cumulative percent fail versus time data for steps in stress temperature is shown to have an Arrhenius model dependency with a ΔH of 1.1 eV. However, recovery of the failed cells under stress conditions (with bias applied) indicates the failure mechanism to be other than classical surface inversion. Data is presented showing the inverse dependency of the additional cure on cumulative percent fail. Explanation of this phenomena is attributed to dipoles that are associated with Incompletely cured polyimide (potential linkages), aligning in the preferential E-field direction, thus Inducing an image charge (an electron) at the silicon surface (quasi inversion). Degree of cure is ascertained from dissipation factor measurements performed on metallized silicon test wafers which have 2 - 4 μm polyimide films on their upper surfaces. Aluminum dot and mercury probe techniques are compared."
"Regions of polymer encapsulant formulations are frequently exposed to high temperatures and high electric field strengths when used in encapsulation of semiconductor devices. The technique of thermally stimulated discharge is used to study effects of these polarizing fields on various epoxy compounds. The dependence of the unique discharge curve shapes found for these systems on chemical composition is noted. New methods of analysis are presented. Desirable polarization properties for an epoxy encapsulant are defined, and an approach to the development of systems exhibiting these desirable properties is outlined."
"The purpose of this investigation was to determine if liquid-liquid thermal shock preconditioning would affect subsequent longterm temperature cycling performance of ceramic and/or plastic dual-in-line packaged devices or ceramic or metal flat packages. Three levels of preconditioning were investigated, each followed by three levels of temperature cycling to form a 3×3 balanced matrix, analyzed by an Analysis of Variance. Fifteen cycles of preconditioning were used (as required to process Class A 38510 parts), followed by up to 3,000 cycles of temperature cycling. This investigation showed that there was no significant thermal-shock/temperature cycling interactions, but that a wide range of life response was observed between and within package types. This experiment increases our knowledge of device behavior when subjected to extended temperature cycling and allows, direct comparisons between plastic and ceramic dual-in-line packages. End of life was observed for several of the samples. The results indicated that there was no significant interaction between the levels of preconditioning used and the subsequent extended temperature cycling used, regardless of package type or material used. For DC electrical failures, there was no independent effect due to temperature cycling, nor independent effect due to thermal shock preconditioning for any of the package types. There was a very strong independent effect due to thermal shock with respect to both indicated and confirmed fine leak failures within the black ceramic dual-in-line packages only. The white ceramic sidebraze package passed all leak testing without a single hermeticity failure."
"This tutorial is a review of several basic analytical techniques used to perform failure analysis on integrated circuits. Included are methods for failure verification, package opening, and electrical die probing. \"Secrets\" for obtaining ac measurements above 1MHz are discussed along with techniques of microsurgery for isolation of integrated components. A detailed presentation of the metallurgical technique of angle lapping is included along with an error correction scheme to aid in precise junction depth measurements. Chemical formulas for staining silicon and selectively removing silicon oxides and metallization are revealed."
"Factors to be considered in selecting a hermetic seal test technique are reviewed and discussed. These include package size and condition as well as the objectives of the testing. Also factors which may contribute to result error and wrong conclusions are examined. Why they cause error and the type of results one should be suspicious of are discussed. The effects of shock levels, vibration level and frequency on particle detection using the impact noise technique are reviewed. Also methods of attaching devices to the transducer are discussed. Positive actions that can be taken to improve the results of hermeticity and particle detection test are also pointed out."
"Routine failure analysis of dielectric defects using nematic liquid crystals is possible with the method described in this paper. The refinements on previously described implementations result in excellent definition of the pinhole site. The paper discusses the principle involved in liquid crystal pinhole detection and details a practical liquid crystal fixture and device preparation. The influence of cell voltage polarity is illustrated and shown to be an important factor in achieving satisfactory results. The effectiveness of using dark field illumination and polarized light is shown and compared with the conventional bright field illumination used by prior authors. CMOS, MOS capacitor, and bipolar device analyses are included. Results are presented in sufficient detail to allow the reader to easily implement the technique in his own laboratory."
"A nondestructive technique to identify localized defects in the gate dielectric of MOS devices has been developed. The technique is based upon electron beam induced conductivity modulation which gives rise to a relatively large increase in gate current under an applied bias when the beam scans a localized defect area. Measurements on devices with low gate breakdown voltage have been made and correlated with regions where subsequent catastrophic gate breakdown occurred. A circuit description and physical model of the technique is presented."
"The ultra-sonic probe was invented to go where conventional probes could never go and to do what conventional probes could never do. Special problems related to \"isolation cuting\" of titanium-platinum-gold interconnects are essentially eliminated. Electrical node probing through deep insulation glass on multi-level metal I/C's is now possible. In addition, the ultra-sonic probe makes possible a new, fast and accurate technique for measuring oxide thickness over selected circuit components. Isolation cutting, electrical node probing and glass thickness measurements are all techniques advanced in the \"state-of-the-art\" with the application of this new, simple, and low cost instrument."
"A method for accurately measuring the ambient gas hermetically sealed within the cavity of micro-electronic package is described. Design consideration for the opening chamber are discussed. The type of mass spectrometer and its operation are detailed for those who might be selecting one as a detector. Finally, the pumping system and an automated data analysis system are considered in detail. Once assembled, the gas analysis system must be accurately calibrated. The various methods used for calibration are discussed, followed by section which relates the analysis results to the assembly and sealing of the microcircuit package."
"Two surface analysis techniques utilizing ion beams, Ion Scattering Spectrometry (ISS) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) will be discussed. These techniques use a low-energy (1-5 keV) noble gas ion beam to determine elemental and chemical surface analysis of a wide variety of materials. Both ISS and SIMS are sensitive to the first monolayer of atoms. This, combined with charge neutralization to prevent beam wander, surface electric fields, etc., provide for composition depth profiles with monolayer resolution on such materials as glasses, semi- conductors, and polymeric coatings.1 The use of recently developed ion guns to generate high-bright-ness, small-diameter ion beams allows imaging ISS and SIMS analysis for applications requiring high spatial resolution. Principles of the technique as well as several illustrative examples of ISS and SIMS surface analysis will be presented."
"High spatial resolution Auger electron spectroscopy in an SEX is presented, and aspects of vacuum requirements for AES in a diffusion-pumped SEM are discussed. The vacuum system of a Cambridge Stereoscan* was rebuilt. Auger spectra recorded after 45 minutes of electron bombardment demonstrated that the carbon buildup-due to the polymerization of hydrocarbon molecules can be prevented by using the gas-jet technique. Auger data taken in an unmodified Cambridge Stereoscan, using only the gas-jet technique, is also presented. The spatial resolution of the SEM operating in the Auger mode is a function of necessary beam current, lens aberrations, and gun brightness. In the existing SEX equipped with a LaB6 electron gun, beam diameters of 0.4 μm containing 4 x 10-7 A at 20 kV were obtained. This allowed the recording of greyscale Auger images with less than 0.5 μm spatial resolution in 400 sec."

"In management of technology in the late 20th century period, many trends are identifiable. With the importance of technology in today's world, these industrial/technological/sociological trends present great challenges and opportunities to management. For example, a proper balance between productivity and quality of life is an elusive goal. The writer had a unique opportunity to study some of these trends and developments in the automotive production line setting in northern European countries: Sweden, Germany, England, and Norway. The following report is a summary of these studies. Clearly, traditional production line problems involving boredom and labor unrest can be amelorated by job enrichment and teamwork organization which modifies cycle times* from about one minute to as much as 30 to 50 minutes. These trends and their impact on engineering management are worthy of careful study."

"A new approach to the modeling of the evolution in time of disease treatment is presented. The resulting model is that of a white stochastic incidence sequence generating a prevalence sequence as the output of a linear, stochastically time-varying system. The average time behavior of the episode is identified through the prevalence autocorrelation function; the latter is measured from data generated by the Quebec health-care system. The distribution of the episode duration is obtained and used to derive other statistical quantities."
"A computation is presented which enables robots with six degrees of freedom to orient and position workpieces against fixtures. It is assumed that the robot can grasp a single workpiece and that a vision system can determine the three-dimensional locations of three feature points on that workpiece. A feature point is a unique point on a workpiece, such as the apex of a cone, which may be located visually by examining neighboring edges or surfaces. The spatial relation between workpiece and fixture which is to be the goal of arm motion is specified by measurements taken as the workpiece is held with the correct posture by a programmer. These measurements are the spatial locations of three noncollinear feature points on the workpiece and three noncollinear feature points on the fixture. The computation presented adjusts for relative motion between fixture and robot if the vision system keeps track of the three feature points on the fixture. The solution to the equations presented is a set of arm link parameters which satisfy the goal of relative workpiece placement. The general form of the equations permits application of the computation to robots with different kinematic configurations."
"With the aid of statistical detection theory, the continuous optimum Bayes recognition scheme for machine characters is developed using a sufficient statistic approach. This result is then extended to the discrete case and the associated problems such as the sampling effects are examined. Using the discrete optimum recognition model, design parameters are then developed. Among these are the critical sampling matrix which provides a lower bound for the sampling rates and the rate matrix which provides information on the classification error. Algorithms such as the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform are then employed to calculate these discrete optimum model design parameters. Based on this theoretical background a machine print recognition problem is presented. The design parameters are computed and the discrete optimum system is simulated on the digital computer. Finally some actual machine print data is recognized and the results are analyzed."
"A nonarithmetic procedure is described for discovering among a set of points in a d-dimensional space, the k neighbors nearest a given point, according to the Minkowski \"max metric.\" It is shown that this procedure may be used to eliminate distance calculations when finding nearest neighbors according to any Minkowski p-metric. When used with a set of uniformly distributed sample points, the expected number of distance calculations n required by this technique is given by E[n] ≃ kCp,d where Cp,d is a constant determined by p and d. In the case of the Euclidean metric used in two dimensions with 1000 uniformly distributed sample points, the effective number of distance calculations required to find the nearest neighbor is approximately five."
"An analysis of the correction schemes for multistage lot-production systems is given for an extension of the discussion in earlier studies. The methodology which will be outlined is classified into two areas: 1) maintenance of the parallel lot-production system and 2) maintenance of the serial lot-production system. Although this study has a specific viewpoint, it claims that the function of sampling inspection can be translated into the measure of process control beyond its original purpose."

"Three perspectives-need-oriented, value-oriented, and technology-oriented-were used to develop an overview of cable comminications policy issues. A need-oriented perspective shed light on the specific policy issues in the five service areas of the community information system, consumer information system, teleshopping/telebanking, teleeducation, and telemedicine, and in the social experimentation of these services. A value-oriented perspective identified programming diversity as a more important social policy issue than economic efficiency in cablecasting. A corresponding research agenda is presented for policy and institutional changes to increase ideological and stylistic diversity in television programming. From a technology-oriented perspective, the most important development impinging on cable communication is that of fiber optics. The policy issues here are so far-reaching that research should be started now, along the direction of a specific research agenda, to study policy options dealing with the convergence of telephone systems and cable systems."
"In the setting of abstract automata, it is shown that a feedback regulator must incorporate a dynamic model of the exosystem (\"outside world\") to which the regulator is designed to respond. The result is based on general lattice-theoretic definitions of the concepts of feedback and observability."
"An extension is presented of certain previous optimization results concerning the capabilities, under certain conditions, of the single regulated multiservice firm relative to multifirm alternatives. The extension enables account to be taken of the important possibility (not studied earlier) that the multifirm alternative, as well as the single multiservice firm, can provide each of the services at several different levels of quality and at different prices. In the case of the multifirm alternative, here any subset of the firms is permitted to collectively provide any service at a price and level of quality. It is proved, for example, that (under the type of assumptions used earlier) the single multiservice firm can choose prices and indices of quality so that its prices (or, if it wishes, its quantity-weighted-sums, each sum for one service, of \"quality-to-price ratios\") are Pareto optimal."
"Possibly the most revolutionary development to impact upon decisionmaking has been the electronic computer. Its capability to process large volumes of data rapidly, to make complex computations in fractions of seconds, and to provide outputs in a variety of formats has markedly expanded the boundaries of decisionmaking. Notwithstanding such progress, the computer's contribution to decisionmaking has thus far been largely limited to routine and repetitive operations which lend themselves to the development of standard decisionmaking procedures. This has been an important contribution, yet most decisionmaking situations, particularly at higher levels of management, are unique and ill structured requiring flexible and adaptive responses. Man-machine systems are thought to offer potential for assisting management in meeting these requirements. The study reported here examines comparative problem-solving performance of individuals communicating directly with the computer (on-line processing) versus individuals communicating with the computer in an intermittent fashion (batch processing). The study is marked by an effort to take up the challenge of management problems having no set solution procedure. Performance measurements include objective functions, understanding of variable interactions, and comparative problem-solving patterns."

"A model is developed for a monopolist, in a dynamic market, who seeks to maximize his overall profits over a certain planning horizon. Conditions for the optimal supply-price curves for both finite and infinite horizon problems are obtained and some interesting properties of the optimal paths are explored. A special (linear-demand, quadratic-cost) case of this model is then treated and explicit characterization of the market price-supply behaviors is obtained."
"A simple argument is used to demonstrate that economically ad hoc (but technically efficient) production decisions give rise to imputed marginal costs of all inputs, provided at least one marginal cost is given. These imputed or de facto costs have a number of important uses in problems where there is a high degree of uncertainty or controversy surrounding the true values involved; and their existence tends to contradict the common assertion that ad hoc decision methods avoid the necessity (and responsibility) for evaluating certain costs. A number of application areas are indicated. An example from a recent study of electrical power generation is carried along as a primary illustration of concepts; another example involving a space heating system is considered in some detail at the end."
"Lake Winnipeg is a large body of water located in western Canada. The construction of hydroelectric power plants on the Nelson River, which constitutes the only drain, has led to the consideration of the lake as a storage reservoir. The resulting regulation proposals can be evaluated by means of the model here developed. The model incorporates the multiple-basin structure of the lake, fluctuations in river inflows, and wind-set (the tilting of the lake surface under the action of a strong wind). The lake is represented by a first-order fluid model, containing two basins connected by a resistive channel. An analogous electrical model is derived from the fluid model, using current, voltage, capacitance, and resistance for (respectively) flow, water level, storage capacity, and flow resistance. A voltage source accounts for the wind-set function, whose coefficients are set to fit experimental data. The wind-set dynamics are modeled as first-order lags. The regulating element is the variable outflow resistance, which represents the control structure at the Nelson River. Several regulation schemes are examined by solving the model equations on a digital computer. The outflow resistance is a function of the water level as measured at some point in the lake. Solutions for various functions and measurement points are compared. The results show undesirably large level changes in the South Basin in spite of the good regulation achieved in the North Basin."
"Some geometrical visual illusions are analyzed in terms of the perceptual field. Psychological distance, which differs from physical distance, is introduced to explain the illusions. A theory is proposed in which the psychological distance is represented as a function of the field potential induced by the stimulus figure. By defining the psychological distance and line, the straight line and the length in the figure can be determined, and geometrical visual illusions can be explained as distortions of the metric of the perceptual field."
"Control augmentation and work load reduction by means of kinesthetic information provided by the manipulator are discussed. The control stick is loaded by a torque motor and the system is so interconnected that it presents complete kinesthetic input and output information from the controlled plant. Thus the control task involves the same kinesthetic cues and low work load as in direct handling of objects. It is demonstrated that within 20 rad/s, which is the effective bandwidth in manual control, the method is realizable for a large variety of plants which may be unstable and time varying. Tracking and regulating tests demonstrate that very substantial improvements in accuracy and reduction in workload are obtained in comparison with ordinary isotonic, isomorphic, or isometric manipulators. A test for the fixed set point regulation task involving a second-order plant reveals that the control force law involved is strikingly similar to that of a linear regulator with an energy constraint obeying a quadratic performance criterion. The corresponding theoretical closed-loop transfer function is in agreement with known linear models of the manual neuromuscular system."
"The development and experimental validation of an analytical model for manual visual field control (VFC) of aircraft is presented. A basic model for control-oriented visual field information (VFI) is proposed and formulated in an optimal control framework. A special case of VFC is studied, namely, the manual lateral control of a TV guided remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) along a straight reference trajectory in the presence of side gusts. For experimental validation, a five-degree-of-freedom fixed-base simulator has been constructed to simulate a RPV flight along a nominally straight reference trajectory. The starting point in the validation program was a VFI model based on error detection at a single looking distance, which is proved to be correct for fixed distance viewing but not for the complete VFC task. The analytical model is then reformulated to allow VFI detection at two looking distances. This two-distance VFI model was found to be an adequate representation for the complete VFC task and to match the experimental results closely, thus enabling the determination of the human operator (HO) parameters within narrow limits."
"The problem of removing random noise from gray tone images without significantly sacrificing the subjective resolution is considered. Based on a subjective visibility function, which gives the relationship between the visibility of a unit noise and a measure of local spatial detail (spatial masking), two procedures are developed to adapt continuously the finite impulse response of a two-dimensional, noncausal, linear digital filter. At sharp transitions in the image intensity, the filter operator is strongly peaked to preserve the resolution, whereas in flat areas it is flat to effectively average out the random noise. The first procedure (S-filter) is computationally more efficient, but does not perform as well as the second method (SD-filter) which requires solution of a new optimization problem at every picture element. Results of several simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Extensions are pointed out to incorporate different adaptation procedures and psychovisual criteria other than the type of spatial masking used here."
"The three-dimensional reconstruction of the radioisotope source distribution of coordinated radioisotope scintigrams is complicated by the point spreading function created by the imaging system (conical imaging) and the attenuation of gamma rays through the body. A new reconstruction method is proposed by converting the complicated existing reconstruction problem into the classical problem of weighted projection in the Fourier complex space upon which a modified additive algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) can be employed. Mathematical derivation, reconstruction algorithms, and illustrative computer results are included."

"Estimation theory is used to develop a model of a human decision maker in a self-paced, visual data smoothing task. The model is basically a noisy fixed-point smoother combined with a weighting function that discounts data in relation to its distance (in time) from the point being smoothed. Experimental data is used to estimate the parameters of the model. Applications of the model to the design of information displays and man-computer interactive decision making systems are considered."
"A model of a distributed computer system for transaction processing is described. The system configuration problem is formulated as a problem of deciding transaction allocation, routing, processor allocation, and line allocation to satisfy certain performance requirements and design constraints. A heuristic design procedure for hierarchical computer systems is described. Based upon this design procedure, an experimental interactive configurator for distributed computer system design is implemented in APL. Topics for further investigation are discussed."
"Starting from the definition of the Fourier transform, the matrix expressions of both one- and two-dimensional Fourier transforms and their inverse transforms are given, which show that the discrete Fourier transforms and their inverse transforms are closely related to the nature of a balanced polyphase system. The system structures are derived from the matrix expressions, which are shown diagramatically. A special feature of the system structure is that the main devices necessary for hardware implementation are tapped delay lines, product operators, adders, and a sinusoidal wave generator."
"The ability to detect individual objects in complex scenes is an important aspect of human perception. The good Gestalt condition is an attempt to ensure that machines have a similar ability. We define \"object classes\" in terms of the machine's discriminatory ability and require that the presence of an object in a scene is reflected in the machine's representation of that scene. We find that the good Gestalt condition places constraints on the perceptual tasks which can be performed by a machine with a given representation space. In particular, a machine with a finite dimensional vector representational space cannot consistently detect relationships between objects."

"A model developed for optimal allocation of sampling resources in a surveillance system designed to enforce certain environmental standards is described. While the presentation is done in the specific context of a wastewater effluent pollution surveillance system, the methodology developed is potentially useful in other environmental areas. The surveillance system considered is one applicable to a finite number of sources, each containing one or more contaminants. A source can be sampled to determine whether any of its contaminants exceeds a maximum allowed value. If such an excess is detected, then the source is said to be in violation. The objective is to allocate the sampling resources for each source during a certain monitoring period such as to minimize a certain performance index, subject to a budget constraint. This performance index is taken as the expected environmental damage due to the undetected violations. The resulting optimization problem, which is of the integer programming type, is shown to be amenable to solution via the method of maximum marginal return."
"In the research and development environment, the classical decision model, even though modified to include multiple objectives or attributes, fails in the following ways. 1) It uses linear attribute weighting functions. 2) It does not incorporate uncertainty distributions in estimates of total value and attribute attainment. 3) It does not facilitate group decision making. A computer-assisted decision model has been developed to utilize decision analysis information more effectively. A hypothetical analysis of advanced nuclear waste management alternatives illustrates its application. A simulation technique predicts the preferred decision based on estimates of attribute levels, utility functions, and an evaluation of the relative importance of the attributes."
"A generalization of the E-filter originated by Moore and Parker [10] from a one-dimensional filter to a nonlinear two-dimensional filter is presented. It is demonstrated that the response of the E-filter is almost independent of the frequency of the incoming signal under certain conditions but depends largely on the signal amplitude. Consequently, it can be used to filter out low-amplitude noise which has been superimposed additively on the signal. The performance of a one-dimensional E-filter as applied sequentially to the rows and then the columns of a digitized image is compared with the direct application of a two-dimensional E-filter. A simple two-dimensional E-filter digital realization and several filtered biomedical images are presented to demonstrate the application of this nonlinear filtering technique."
"Given a set of objects in a scene whose identifications are ambiguous, it is often possible to use relationships among the objects to reduce or eliminate the ambiguity. A striking example of this approach was given by Waltz [13]. This paper formulates the ambiguity-reduction process in terms of iterated parallel operations (i.e., relaxation operations) performed on an array of (object, identification) data. Several different models of the process are developed, convergence properties of these models are established, and simple examples are given."
"The specification of the pragmatic information content of graphical displays is approached by defining three display attributes- quantity, format, and time. A mathematical measure of pragmatic information quantity is proposed while the effects of format and time on pragmatic information processing activity are discussed qualitatively. An experimental evaluation of the effects of quantity, format, and timing of pragmatic information in a specially constructed graphically oriented design task is described."

"In the activities of the Dutch Global Dynamics project group, much attention has been paid to studies of the world models of Forrester and Meadows. The first part of the results of a thorough analysis of the ultimate version of the World3 model is discussed. It is argued that the capital and resource sector plays a leading part in the model and that the behavior of growth, followed by decline, is embedded in only a few of the assumptions included in this sector of the model. Subsequently, a more profound and mathematical analysis is discussed, with a view to understanding the sector's behavior in greater detail and illustrating the usefulness of a number of methods well known in system theory, which may be applied more generally if insight into a model's behavior is required. The paper is the first in a series in which the analysis of other sectors of World3 and the interplay between the sectors will be discussed."
"The human's ability to estimate the mean and standard deviation of discrete time series is discussed. The effect of polynomial interpolation formulas on these two statistics is considered both mathematically and experimentally. Derivations show that the piece-wise continuous functions resulting from polynomial interpolation have unbiased expected values and biased variances. Results of two experiments are presented that support the idea that humans base their perceptions on the piece-wise continuous result of interpolation and thereby transmit the statistical bias. The practical implications of these results are discussed."
"A heuristic self-organization method for constructing a nonlinear river flow prediction model from the available data such as river flow and areal mean precipitation is presented. Our algorithm, the improved version of the GMDH proposed by A. G. Ivakhnenko, is useful for the prediction of complex nonlinear systems with a large number of variables and with a small amount of available input-output data. The efficiency and usefulness of the proposed sequential prediction algorithm are shown by the use of a simulation model. This algorithm is applied to the flow prediction of the Karasu River in Japan. Numerical comparisons are performed between the prediction model by \"sequential GMDH\" and by the elaborate hydrologic methods, and we show that there are improvements in the newly introduced prediction algorithm for real-time computation."
"A heuristic technique is presented for detecting the presence of an unknown signal in noise and estimating its waveshape. The heuristic utilizes the most recent estimate of the waveshape as a template against which new observations are matched. If the match is \"good,\" the observation is used to update the estimate, and the procedure is repeated. If the match is \"poor,\" the observation is discarded. It is the decisions of the detector which direct the evolution of the estimate while simultaneously the current estimate directs the detector's performance. The mutual interactions of the estimator/detector are conducted without external supervision and without the benefit of training samples, and thus the system falls into the category of a self-learning decision directed adaptive system."
"Projection transform technique is applied to digital image transmission. Transform samples on various central sections of a Fourier space are attained with a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Quantization, coding, and transmission follow in order. The complete Fourier space information is then, upon reception of signals, estimated from the transform samples at these various central sections. The reconstructed picture is produced by the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform."
"A general fixed structure automaton acting in stationary random multireaction environment is described. Some necessary conditions are shown for automata to be purposeful or adaptive in an unknown environment (to be more profitable than a no-purpose, or random, automaton). By the necessary conditions it is proved that there exists no perfectly adaptive automaton. A necessary condition for automata with minimum state space to be purposeful is obtained. This condition characterizes their structures explicitly, so that a little restriction gives a sufficient condition. Some general subclasses of automata are proposed, and necessary and sufficient conditions for such automata to be purposeful are investigated. Furthermore as properties of a purposeful automaton, the time required to adapt and the stability of adapting to the random environment are discussed."

"Mathematical models are formulated to help planners, elected officials, and citizens in small cities estimate the socioeconomic and fiscal impacts of residential development. The city of Cohoes, NY, serves as a case study. The need for this work is established by reviewing the city's history from its period of growth as a mill town in the nineteenth century to its decline and attempt at reversal in the twentieth century. The community development process is briefly discussed. Two levels of models are developed: static and dynamic. The static models, which describe a new steady state in the city, are less expensive to implement but sacrifice flexibility and accuracy. The dynamic models, programmed in an interactive mode on the computer, are more expensive but provide a wider range of data at greater accuracy. The models contain three sectors, a residential sector which describes the changes in population and housing, a commercial sector which describes the changes in the retail economy, and the public sector which accounts for municipal costs, revenues, and tax rates. The inputs are the type and amount of development proposed. Typical outputs are population by age group, the tax revenues derived from the new development, and changes in the property tax rate. The models are calibrated with data from the city, state, and federal governments. Both static and dynamic model results indicate that new private-sector residential development on vacant city lands returns a net surplus of funds to the municipal government and school district."
"A new approach is described for assembling feasible ship trajectories from ship position sightings. The ship may or may not be identified on a particular sighting. The proposed algorithm does not attempt to resolve sighting-trajectory assignment ambiguities. No a priori ship motion model is used except for a bound on the maximum speed. The feasible relative ship motion and identity information are encoded into binary matrices. These binary matrices are computed recursively using logical AND and OR operations. The algorithm is analogous to the Kalman filter."
"An experimental method of scheduling the necessary maintenance activities on generator units in a power system is developed. The problem is identified as an integer programming problem, and a method based on the branch-and-bound technique is developed. The maintenance scheduling problem is characterized by a large number of complex constraints. The method presented is capable of taking into account all these constraints and hence, results in a practically implementable solution, if a feasible solution exists. Other features of the method are employment of a number of different objective functions and discovery of a feasible solution if one exists. Furthermore, unlike most present methods, it actually finds the optimal solution. The operation of the method is exemplified by application to a realistic system."
"The distributed delay has found widespread application in the modeling of aggregative processes involving the flow of entities with random transit times through a given process. In most of these applications it is assumed that the mean entity transit time is fixed. There are, however, a number of important applications in aggregative economic, physical, social, and biological systems in which the mean entity transit time is time varying. A time-varying distributed delay model is developed along with a Fortran subroutine for its simulation as part of a larger system model. Examples illustrate applications of this time-varying distributed delay model to aggregative biological and economic processes."
"An approach to modeling human driver behavior in single-lane car following which is based on a finite-state decision structure is considered. The specific strategy at each point in the decision tree was obtained from observations of typical driver behavior. The synthesis of the decision logic is based on position and velocity thresholds and four states defined by regions in the phase plane. The performance of the resulting assumed intuitively logical model was compared with actual freeway data. The match of the model to the data was optimized by adapting the model parameters using a modified PARTAN algorithm. The results indicate that the heuristic model behavior matches actual car-following performance better during deceleration and constant velocity phases than during acceleration periods."
"A fully automatic transistor wire-bonding system utilizing image-processing techniques is described. The system is composed of a minicomputer, image processors, and a maximum of 50 wire-bonding machines. Each machine has a TV camera installed to pick up, through a microscope, the image of transistor chips fed into the machine. In this system, one image processor services several machines in a group and analyzes the image signals in a time-sharing mode to determine the chip position at each machine. From the detected coordinates, an XY servomechanism in each machine is activated to bond and stretch wires between the electrodes on the chip and the outer leads. The recognition of electrode positions is accomplished by the multiple local pattern matching method in which redundancy is used in achieving a high recognition rate. An analysis of the system and basic features of the position recognition algorithm are also described. This method opens the possibility of economical automation of processes possible only by the human eye to date."
"Aspects of a control system that employs a minicomputer for the programming and control of industrial robots are described. The control system hierarchy, the system interface, and the software controller design are presented along with the mode of operation and the methods of robot training and on-line testing. The features of the robot control language (Alfa) and a typical program structure of material handling processes are described. Alfa is a high-level problem-oriented language that allows the operator to program the robot's activities, including process and timer interrupt handling, effectively, without resorting to lower level languages."

"The complex process of medical diagnosis has traditionally relied on the experience and judgement of the clinician. With the increased application of systems ideas to medical problems in general, it is timely to consider their application to the diagnostic situation. Decision theory is well established, and several decision models have been applied to medical problems. A unified approach to clinical decision making is presented. This approach combines partially observable Markov decision processes with cause-effect models as a probabilistic representation of the diagnostic process. This new class of model has a potential application to medical diagnosis and treatment, and a respiratory system example is presented. The methodology is given for combining the patient states of health, the clinician's state of knowledge of the cause-effect representation from the observation space, and finally the treatment decisions with which to restore the patient to a more desirable state of health."
"Feature extraction for parametric problems is carried out via the direct minimization of the probability of error estimated by the F-method. The proposed methods for feature ordering and feature extraction are applied to the medical diagnosis of two cancer diseases (cancer of the pancreas and primary cancer of the liver) with encouraging results."
"The application of systems dynamic modeling techniques to the problem of analyzing the effects of telecommunication developments on society is discussed. Initial attempts to develop a social interaction model with the telecommunication system have produced four possible social reactions to growth of the system. These four reactions can be summarized as invasion of privacy, information pressures, social dependence, and social tension. Although the model is presently very simple and does not contain many interconnections between these four variables, it is providing useful insight into the interactions between telecommunication systems growth and social response. The causal diagrams are presented with the computer model in its present state of development. Several computer runs are shown indicating some counter-intuitive results from the basic model, and an explanation of these results is presented."
"A program which recognizes real roads, their intersections, and objects which are road-like is presented. Although the work has been strongly motivated by the real roads as they are seen from the ERTS satellite, the visual model of a road can be used for recognition of any road-like objects. This model is structured in such a way that it can handle real roads as well as rivers and streams as they are seen on satellite pictures, tracks in bubble chambers, and veins under the appropriate magnification."
"We develop a theory for the analysis of binary-valued digital pictures, particularly blobs and arcs, on a fairly large class of nonuniform as well as uniform mosaics. These so-called \"acute mosaics\" can represent a wide variety of schemes for digitizing images in machine vision systems. These mosaics can also represent a variety of retinas in human and animal visual systems. We prove the existence of minimum-perimeter-polygon (MPP) representations of digitized blobs on arbitrary mosaics and the uniqueness of MPP's in acute mosaics. We introduce the concept of \"relative convexity,\" and show its relation to the MPP. We show that the MPP reflects the concavities of the digitized blob. We describe and prove the validity of simple tests for cellular convexity and cellular straightness. We present and prove the validity of an algorithm for computing the MPP of so-called \"normal complexes\" (a broad class of digitized blobs) on an acute mosaic."

"A heavy ion beam probe is used to examine the radial electrostatic potential profile in the Modified Penning Discharge. The plasma potential in the discharge violates the usual constraint on the ion beam energy in that the primary probing beam energy undergoes large changes in its energy while passing through the plasma. In order to determine the radial potential profile, the primary beam trajectories are calculated to agree with measured trajectories by parametric variation of a potential model in the trajectory calculating program. This iteration calculation provides a first approximation to the profile. This profile can be used to predict observation of secondary ions, and observation of such ions provides a confirmation and cross check on the potential profile model found by the primary beam."
"A time-dependent, zero-dimensional computer model with no adjustable parameters, for magnetically confined plasmas, is described. It predicts spatially averaged values of plasma density and electron and ion temperatures, and its predictions compare well with volume averaged measurements made in the Wisconsin Levitated Toroidal Octupole. The model is easily adaptable to predict scaling in other devices."
"A kinetic model was developed to describe the reactions of CO and H2 to CH4 and C2H2in a microwave plasma. The experimental system consisted of a 24 mm I.D. tubular quartz reactor which passed through a microwave cavity. A variable-incident power waveguide system could supply up to 800 watts of incident microwave power to the cavity. The reactant gas mixture of H2 and CO flowed through the reactor, where a plasma was maintained under pressures of 20 - 100 mm Hg. The reactor effluent was analyzed by IR spectroscopy for CH4 and C2H2. Conversions of up to 5.3% CO to C2H2 and 7.2% CO to CH4 were observed. A 26-reaction kinetic model was developed and fitted to the experimental data. The plasma reactor was modeled in two zones: a discharge zone where electron-impact dissociations produce H, C, and O, and a downstream recombination zone where the atomic species from the discharge recombine. The discharge zone was modeled as a well-mixed reactor, and the recombination zone was modeled as a plug-flow reactor. The model was able to explain the asymptotic shape of the observed conversion versus residence time data; the effect is due to a kinetic limitation. This also explains why the conversions obtained in the plasma cannot be predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium."
"This paper is internded to demonstrate to students that electron Landau growth of plasma waves is an easily understood and computed phenomenon. This derivation does not use the usual Fourier-Laplace transform technique with the inversion and final result being obtained by contour integration and residue theory. Instead, a simple treatment, following the original work of Vlasov, is used. Landau's original solution is recovered both for growth and decay, but only the growing part rigorously satisfies the initial assumptions."
"By setting the frequency ω in Vlasov's equation to a complex number, we have been able to remove the singularity in the integrand that has, in our own experience, caused our students so much trouble in the past. The resulting proper integrals are real, easily evaluated by elementary means, and yield correctly Landau's value for growth (and by extension, damping). The basic point in Justifying the derivation is that Landau damping for the student is no longer a mysterious phenomenon, obtained only via complex, contour integration, but an easily computed fact."
"A mathematical model is presented for the calculation of the two dimensional flow and temperature fields in an inductively coupled plasma. The model is based on the solution of the correcponding momentum, continuity and energy equations simultaneously with the one dimensional magnetic and electric field equations. Results were obtained for a plasma torch, 1.4 cm. radius, and 18.2 cm. long with a four turn induction coil, 2.4 cm. radius and 3 cm. The oscillator frequency was 3 MHz. Calculations were made for argon under atmospheric pressure at a power level of 3.77 KW with different plasma gas flow rate over the range of 5 to 25 gm/min. The results clearly demonstrate the existence of the magnetic pumping effect which is responsible for the formation of two recirculation eddies, one at each end of the coil. As the plasma gas flow rate is increased, the downstream eddy is swept away leaving only one recirculation eddy on the upstream side of the fire-ball. This eddy produces a back flow of the order of 20 m/s. Increasing the plasma gas flow rate is also observed to cause a substantial reduction of the heat flux to the plasma confining tube."
"The stability of electrostatic ion cyclotron waves propagating obliquely with respect to the background magnetic field is studied for collisional, fully-ionized plasmas in which there is a relative field-aligned streaming between electrons and ions. It is found that electron-ion collisions, in conjunction with electron streaming, provides a mechanism for instability. The role of electron streaming is to supply a source of free energy and the role of electron-ion collisions is to restrict the field-aligned mobility of the electrons, thus preventing them from establishing a Boltzmann equilibrium. Ion-ion collisions and finite ion Larmor radius are found to exert a stabilizing influence. The instability is analyzed for both current-carrying plasmas and counterstreaming-beam-plasma systems."
"Part per million concentrations of some organic vapors in telephone relay environments are known to produce carbonaceous particles on arcing contact surfaces. Enhanced arcing then occurs and the reliability and contact lifetime of the relays is impaired. The enhancement of break arcs due to the presence of carbonaceous particles has been described in paper I. Break Arcs.6 In this present paper the enhancement of arcs occurring on approach of electrodes (make arcs) is discussed and is thought to be due to the injection of plasmas formed by the electronic and ionic bombardment of carbon particles on the anode and cathode respectively. The plasmas formed from these particles can then be related to arc-duration enhancement. The observation that under `activated' conditions no anode-type arcs exist but those that form are all of the cathode variety, can also be explained by the model. A calculation of the amount of carbon required to fully activate a 10-2 cm2 contact area yields 6.3 × 10-8 gm in agreement with values of other workers."
"Commercial indicator lamp glow discharge tubes in the subnormal glow mode exhibit variable frequency tuned filter video response to optical and microwave radiation. Sensitivity to optical radiation can be particularly increased by using such devices in the subnormal rather than abnormal glow. These phenomena are discussed in terms of physical electronics and an equivalent circuit. A comparison is made of abnormal and subnormal glow mode properties. It is hoped that this model can lead to glow discharge lamp design for specific circuit applications involving subnormal glow mode characteristics. Relationships between glow discharge detector physical and electronic parameters are derived."
"The dispersion relations and cut-off frequencies for the appropriate modes existing inside the relativistically moving lossy isotropic plasma waveguide are studied and are found to depend on waveguide dimensions, plasma-parameters and the drift velocity of plasma medium. The field as well as power flow are also studied in detail and it is found that the fields as well as power flow for TE modes are unchanged while for TM modes they are modified depending on the drift velocity of the plasma medium. The results are compared with those obtained for the case of lossless relativistically moving and lossy stationary plasma waveguides."
"This paper describes an experimental device which produces a large, homogeneous, quiescent, and magnetized plasma. Typical numbers as measured in an Argon plasma are: Size - 6 cm diameter × 100 cm length; Density - 108 to 1010 electrons/cm3; Electron temperature - 1 to 3 e. v.; Noise fluctuation - eϕf1/kBTe < 5%; Magnetic field - to 5 kG."

 "The often used absolute, ratio, and off-axis peaking methods of LTE spectroscopy are examined using the Multithermal Equilibrium (MTE) multifluid model. The partial MTE model distinguishes between the upper level and total excitation temperatures of atom and ion (Texßa or Texßi and Texa or Texi, respectively) as well as different valued electron (Te) and heavy particle (Ta = Ti) temperatures. In complete MTE, all excitation temperatures are equal valued but may differ from kinetic temperature values. In this paper, the particular temperature approximated by common diagnostic methods is identified. The probable errors in the temperature values are presented in a figure as a function of probable errors in data, temperature and level energy difference. The results indicate that the ratio methods (neutral-neutral, ion-neutral, and continuumneutral) yield upper level excitation temperature values; the absolute neutral line and absolute continuum (at low Texa) yield total atom excitation temperatures; and the off-axis peaking method for the neutral line yields the total excitation temperature. Application of the methods are more complex than in LTE spectroscopy. Probable errors are smallest for the absolute and off-axis peaking methods. The electron temperature may be determined from the continuum-neutral ratio at very high excitation temperatures (Texa >> E∞/10k). The paper also comments on MTE diagnostic methods."
"The feasibility of using a modulated beam of ions as an antenna in the magnetosphere is discussed briefly. A computer simulation of an ion beam in a plasma is presented in which the motion of the ions is prescribed while the electrons in the surrounding plasma are represented by concentric charged shells, each of which moves in the self-consistent field set up by the beam and the other shells. By following the motion of the shells on a computer, an attempt is made to estimate the sheath current that is induced in the plasma by the beam."
"Results of an experimentalprogram to determine the feasibility of using a crossed field device as a high average power triggered closing switch are reported. The tube contained coaxial, cylindrical electrodes and was triggered by pulsing a magnetic field (<0.1 T) to a value sufficiently high to trap electrons and initiate conduction. Holdoff voltages up to 60 kV were achieved, with peak (circuit limited) currents as high as 20 kA and pulse durations in the range of 1 to 100 μs. Ignition jitter was ~0.1 μs, and the voltage recovery rate was 2 kV/μs after 20 kA conduction and a 50 μs deionization time. These single and double shot data indicate that it should be possible to build such a device to operate at high average power levels for use in high power (MW) modulators."
"An expression for the increase of the minimum of breakdown voltage is derived for the transition from plane to cylindrical geometry. The resulting breakdown voltage as a function of the reduced distance between inner and outer electrode, (R2-R1) p shows that for values of (R2-R1) p above the minimum the breakdown voltage decreases by changing from plane to cylindrical geometry. The production of charges is described by the wellknown ionization coefficient α/p depending on the local electric field E/p. Further it is shown that violations of the similarity theorem can not be caused by non-equilibrium ionization as postulated by G. R. G. Raju and R. Hackam. Similarity only fails if certain volume or wall processes become predominant."
"In this work we present analytical and numerical results on the resistivity, heating and radial transport of particles momentum and heat on and near the minor axis of the Tokamak discharge. The crucial role of impurities is emphasized. Asymptotically exact electromagnetics and classical fluid dynamics are utilized to obtain first the case of the straight infinite cylinder. Toroidal effects are then included at the level of the Pfirsch-Schlüter theory. Analytical results from the complete model show the transport coefficients to be classical with enhanced values related to the presence of the impurity ions and the toroidal effects. Numerical results from a simpler simulation model are found to be in reasonable agreement with published experimental results from the ST-Tokamak."
"The self-similar behavior of a single species charged gas which is described by the nonlinear equations of continuity and motion and Poisson's equation is ascertained. Analytical solutions are derived for two possible sources; a suddenly created time dependent source of charge at some point in space and a sudden creation of a time-dependent voltage at some point in space acting on a burst of charge."

"The physics of two-energy-component toroidal plasmas (TCT) is reviewed. Energy \"breakeven\" using the TCT mode (deuteron beams on a triton-target plasma) can be attained at much smaller nτ and temperature than in thermal plasma operation. This result reflects the fact that the fusion power density in a TCT can be much larger than in a thermal DT plasma of the same pressure. The large fusion power density (i. e., large neutron flux) of a TCT may find practical use in a number of applications."
"The concept of topological or structural stability is introduced and its importance in the magnetic confinement of plasmas is discussed. Topological stability requires the presence of a pair of limit cycles in the magnetic field configuration. This paper deals with the design of an experimental device possessing limit cycles. The design includes a high beta (ß ≈ 1), high density (~1016), hot (~100 eV) hygrogen plasma which is to be compressed by a factor of about 5 in a toroidal device of 25 cm average major radius with a capacitor bank rise time of less than 2 μsec. Two shaped toroidal coils with opposing currents and the poloidal compression coils have been designed to give a pressure balance equilibrium and establish the limit cycles. This device could be used to determine the physical significance of topological stability in plasma confinement."
"Experimental observations have been made during steady-state operation of the NASA Lewis Bumpy Torus experiment at input powers up to 150 kW in deuterium and helium gas, and with positive potentials applied to the midplane electrodes. This steady-state ion heating method utilizes a modified Penning discharge operated in a bumpy torus confinement geometry such that the plasma is acted upon by a combination of strong electric and magnetic fields. Experimental investigation of a deuterium plasma revealed electron temperatures from 14 to 140 eV and ion kinetic temperatures from 160 to 1785 eV. At least two distinct modes of operation exist, each of which is associated with a characteristic range of background pressure and electron temperature. Experimental data show that the average ion residence time in the plasma is virtually independent of the magnetic field strength."
"The relative strength and linewidth are calculated for electrostatic mode absorption resonances in (A) a circular microwave cavity containing an axial, axially magnetized plasma column and oscillating in the TE011 mode and (B) a waveguide through the narrow faces of which an axially magnetized plasma column is inserted; in both bases the excitation frequency is taken to be just below the second electron cyclotron harmonic. This is done by solving Maxwell's equations in a warm, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma in cylindrical coordinates to produce an eigenfrequency equation for the cavity and a transmission coefficient for the waveguide. Collisional and end effects are included. An experimental check of the validity of the cavity eigensolutions was carried out."
"Low impedance relativistic electron accelerators currently produce nominal 50 ns pulses that are capable of power levels near 1 Terawatt at impedances near 1 Ohm. The time-dependent diode impedance characteristic plays a major role In efficiently coupling the pulse line power to an electron beam. In an effort to establish the desired accelerator impedance match early in the pulse, experimentalists have investigated cold cathode vacuum breakdown and subsequent space charge limited emission during the ~ 100 kV machine prepulse. This machine prepulse is due to capacitive coupling across the accelerator switches, and consequently cannot be independently studied and optimized. In this paper, a technique for externally introducing a typically 100 kV, low power conditioning pulse prior to the main pulse of a low impedance relativistic electron diode is described, along with techniques for reducing the machine prepulse to less than 5 kV. For various cathode geometries, the breakdown field, closure velocity, and time-dependent impedance established by this external prepulse is measured and compared with an empirical model of space charge limited emission from a hydro-dynamically expanding plasma. 3 Experimental evidence is presented that the high current accelerator impedance is effectively controlled by the relative time delay between the start of the prepulse and the main pulse."
"Time-integrated x-ray pinhole photographs of gold spheres and hemispheres irradiated by focused intense relativistic electron beams have exhibited radiation patterns with a distinct, brightened edge or halo. This report describes Monte Carlo electron-photon transport calculations which were performed to analyze this halo effect. A locally 1-D model of the spherical targets is presented and is used to obtain information concerning the spectral variation of the radiation pattern. These results indicate that a complete model, including film response and effective pinhole size, is required for proper quantitative comparison."
"The theoretical analysis, based on the perturbation technique, of ion-acoustic waves in the vicinity of a Korteweg-de Vries (K-dV) equation derived in a plasma with some negative ions has been made. The investigation shows that the negative ions in plasma with isothermal electrons introduced a critical concentration at which the ion-acoustic wave plays an important role of wave-breaking and forming a precursor while the plasma with non-isothermal electrons has no such singular behaviour of the wave. These two distinct features of ion waves lead to an overall different approach of present study of ion-waves. A distinct feature of non-uniform transition from the nonisothermal case to isothermal case has been shown. Few particular plasma models have been chosen to show the characteristics behaviour of the ion-waves existing in different cases."

 "A crossed field tube is used as an on-off switch to produce square, 25 μs wide current pulses at 40 kV and 3.2 kA. Operation is also demonstrated at 120 Hz at an initial 50 kV and 1.3 kA for a ten pulse train. Calculations indicate that continuous operation at over 150 kW of average power is possible with a suitably designed cooling system. A crossed field tube operated in this way has a higher current capability and lower dissipation than hard vacuum tetrodes and could replace such tubes in higher power, lower impedance modulators."
"Cathode spot theory provides two limiting approaches for the description of reality: The SMOOTH SURFACE MODEL and the ROUGH SURFACE MODE. For the SMOOTH SURFACE MODEL limits of the typical parameters, like current density and spot temperature can be calculated. For the SPOT AT REST we find only the (0)-MODE with typical current density values of 0(105A/cm2) on copper. For the MOVING SPOT we have beside the (0)-MODE also the (1)-MODE with typical current densities 0(109A/cm2). Which of these two modes the moving spot occupies cannot be judged at the time being since the corresponding stability considerations are to complicated. Steenbeck's principal is not applicable to the moving spot due to the non-stationarity. The theoretical limits calculated are not very narrow but measured at the experimental uncertainty the results are quite useful. Higher accuracy - as some people hope for - is not accessible yet for several reasons: First, there are serious limits in our experimental information about the accommidation coefficients of ions at a surface above boiling point, the material loss at such a surface, the temperature dependence of the material parameters and the migration of Joule energy in a high temperature cathode locally above boiling point. Second, we have no theoretical information yet about the radial and the anode side distributions of the cathodic plasma ball with its complicated kinetics. Third, the average effects from the surface roughness influence the smooth surface results and shift the data."
 "The Space Shuttle Orbiter has the geometrical configuration of an aircraft and nonconducting outer skin that is expected to generate considerable transient charging and local potential differences due to the ambient ionospheric plasma. Emission of high-current electron beams has been proposed for the AMPS Spacelab payload that would induce large potentials and return currents to the orbiter skin. Quantitative estimates are presented for the magnitude and transient behavior for both the passive and active conditions. A comprehensive model of the Orbiter environment has been defined that includes the ambient ionospheric medium at a nominal altitude of 400 km and the neutral gas cloud expelled by the vehicle. The outer skin of the vehicle is covered with ~ 1300 m2 of thermal insulation which is fibrous silicon dioxide, and ~ 60 m2 of metal surfaces on rocket motors and exposed instrumentation on the spacelab pallet. The thermal insulation has the dielectric quality of air and an electrical conductivity that has been extimated by NASA at 10-9 to 10-10 per meter but may be as low as 10-13 mhos/m. Local equilibrium potentials for passive conditions (no electron gun current) have been calculated for various ion, electron, and photon shadow zones. These potentials very from -2.4 volts where only electrons and insulator leakage current are present to +3.9 volts where only ion ram current is collected."
"The numerical solutions of Boltzmann transpott equation for the energy distribution of electrons moving in crossed fields in nitrogen have been obtained for 100 ≤ E/p ≤ 1000 V M-1 Torr-1 and for 0≤ B/p ≤ 0.02 Tesla Torr-1 using the concept of energy dependent effective field intensity. From the derived distribution functions the electron mean energy, the tranaverse and perpendicular drift velocities and the averaged effective field intensity (Eavef) which signifies the average field intensity experienced by electron swarms in E × B field have been derived. The maximum difference between the electron mean energy for a given E × B field and that corresponding to Eavef/p (p is the gas pressure) is found to be within ±3.5%."
"Observations of rapid axial oscillations of an intense relativistic electron beam in a magnetic mirror are reported. The mirror field primarily provides radial confinement of the relativistic electrons. The axial confinement was achieved by placing thin aluminized mylar foils at the conjugate mirror field maxima. The region between these foils was filled with a few Torr air to provide a beam induced plasma for charge and current neutralization. The regions outside these foils were maintained at ~10-4 Torr. One foil formed the anode of a space-charge limited relativistic electron diode which launched the beam into the mirror. When the beam passed through the second foil it was no longer charge neutralized. In a manner quite similar to the anode foil oscillations observed by others, a space-charge limited electrostatic well was established which stopped the electrons and re-accelerated them through the foil-thereby reflecting the beam. When the reflected electrons re-entered the diode, they were once again \"electrostatically\" reflected. This process continued until the oscillating beam was either lost through the \"virtual cathodes\" outside the foils, dissipated in the drift region or quenched in the diode plasma after gap closure."
"The MHD equilibrium and stability of noncircular tokamak plasmas limited by a separatrix is studied for reactor size systems. A typical example with a plasma current of 15.8 MA and major radius of 8.1 is presented. The required vertical field is generated by a set of discrete external coils and no conducting shell is included. The detailed equilibrium shape is calculated numerically for a vertical elongated plasma with two stagnation points symmetrically located above and below the midplane as would be required for a system with a poloidal divertor. The plasma height to width ratio is 2, the plasma shape factor is 1.6 and poloidal ß is 2.2. The plasma is locally stable. The general stability criteria with respect to quasi-rigid motions (special kink modes) are calculated numerically and found to be satisfied. Size scaling and the engineering constraints are discussed."
"The problem of electric field penetration into a plasma is investigated employing a nonlinear current saturating conductivity. The case of step electric field applied at the boundary of semi-infinite plasma is studied. It is observed that the skin penetration depth is much larger than the one predicted by the linear theory and is comparable with the rapid field penetration reported in some turbulent heating experiments."
"In this paper we describe the research on supplementary heating of toroidal plasma made in France at the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique and in the European Community (with special reference to the J.E.T. project) in the frame of the national programs. A non exhaustive description of the world effort on this topic is also presented."
"In a computer simulation study, we have observed the parametric decay of an electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to the DC magnetic field into two electron electrostatic waves. We have identified the mechanism as three-wave parametric interaction. The growth constants of the decay waves have been measured. After saturation, the decay waves are observed to trap electrons. Consequently, the velocity distribution function develops a high velocity tail. The details of these processes are discussed. We have found that the kinetic energy of the total assembly of electrons will increase by about a factor of four."
"A modified Korteweg-de Vries equation in a two-dimensional space comprising the externla magnetic field and the direction normal to a density gradient is derived for a plasma consisting of warm ion fluid (γi = 3) and nonisothermal electrons (γe > 1). The effect of ionic temperature and resonant electrons (both trapped and free electrons) on the amplitude and the width of the drift solitary wave is examined."
  "Nonlinear ion-acoustic waves, which in the absence of collisions are moderately stable in the long wave length limit, become modulationally unstable due to presence of collisions. These waves are unstable in the wave number range kmin < k < kmax."
"Plasma heating at the lower hybrid resonance was studied experimentally in a canted magnetic mirror in order to determine the effects of magnetic field curvature on heating efficiency. Heating occurred mainly on what would be the \"outside\" of an equivalent torus, peaking near the hybrid resonant layer. The best conditions for heating were seen to be a relatively flat density profile of magnitude slightly below that where hybrid resonance would be expected. The density profile was seen to move \"outward\" as cant angle was increased, while the hybrid layers were seen to move oppositely, toward what would be the inside of the torus. No significant deleterious effects on the efficiency of the lower hybrid resonant heating (LHRH) were observed as the canting was changed."

 "An appraisal of RCA's internal video tape technical education program indicates that: 1) The program reaches an effective cross section of engineers. 2) Engineers make substantial use of the education in their jobs. 3) Education is one of the top five methods used by engineers to maintain technical viability. 4) The primary factors which lead to obsolescence are located in the job, the organization, and the person. 5) Engineers want the education to be more applied, shorter, and more self-regulated. Plans for the future based on this appraisal are described."
"A program of continuing education for engineers is described. The stress is on educational activities that contribute to the on-the-job performance. The importance of specific educational goals and the responsibility of the engineering supervisor in developing and activating a performance-oriented educational program are emphasized."
"Sandia Laboratories has always provided continuing education opportunities for its engineering and scientific staff. In the early 1970's a special in-hours program was initiated which differs markedly from most academically oriented courses. These differences are reflected in what is taught, how it is taught (use of innovations in instructional design), instructor responsibilities, and how course effectiveness is evaluated. The emphasis is on immediate job-applicability of the courses, and the evaluation process has verified on-the-job uses of the new technologies and concepts presented."
"The author wants to make you more aware of new ways of thinking about things you have been doing right along to achieve career satisfaction and success. Engineers with adequate abilities may see no opportunity for growth; other engineers may expect growth but be unaware of their loss of professional vitality. In either case, a thwarting of personal growth is felt. The ogre, pyramidal organizational structures, contributes to the frustration of an engineer who wants to grow. Failure to distinguish options to pursue different objectives, as contrasted to options of different ways to pursue an objective, clouds awaeness of choices that truly exist."
"In 1968 the development engineering division of IBM recognized the desirability of continuing education for engineers, programmers and scientists in fields other than technology. Needs were defined which included improving the professionals' understanding of the company, improving their career management capability and their ability to achieve personal growth through work. A one-week school was established. This article describes two schools of this type, one on the east coast and one on the west coast. Actually most divisions or locations in IBM are today running similar or related programs. Using these schools as examples, this article reviews their design, their conduct and how the concepts and program have evolved over the years. Original goals are contrasted with current goals. The evolving content of the program is reviewed and some measures, albeit subjective, for the success of the school are discussed. It is believed this program represents a leading experiment in expanding the breadth and types of learning sponsored by industry for the growth of professional employees."
"The Postal Service has long recognized the need to continually develop a professional engineering organization. A program for meeting this goal is presented. An outline of the curriculum and the system for meeting the training and education needs are noted for both on and off the job. In house and in cooperation with Industry and University."
"This paper describes the successful use of Ad Hoc Advisory Committees drawn from universities and industry to jointly design and market continuing engineering studies (non-credit) programs. The joint Ad Hoc Committee technique has been successfully used in five different metropolitan areas to focus university offerings on the needs of its clientele. This has benefited the individual engineer, the companies and the universities involved. An example of a successful on-going continuing engineering studies program using this technique is described. Procedures, experience and \"lessons learned\" with use of the technique are discussed."
"All continuing education activities of the personnel in Union Carbide's Chemicals and Plastics Division Engineering Department are under the policy guidance of that Department's Continuing Education Steering Committee. This paper has been prepared from a report by that Committee to the Engineering Department's Administrative Group listing the 1974 accomplishments and 1975 goals in the following continuing education fields: 1) Personal/Interpersonal Skills Education 2) Management Education 3) Technical Education for Professionals 4) Technical Education for Paraprofessionals"
"Continuing education in the R & D environment is simply learning that is organized in ways which best support the practicing professional in keeping current. Managers are making available formal, organized education, when and as needed, as a preferred alternative to leaving their employees to fend for themselves. To work, a program of continuing education requires the active, shared commitment of manager and employee alike. Some comments on a large in-house program are included."

 "Human and social problems, as well as benefits are often a consequence of technological advances. There is no reason to believe that the application of satellites to education will not create similar consequences. In this paper, several issues of significance in the wide-spread application and use of satellites in education are discussed, including the implications for education and cultural change; the organizational problems in operating a major satellite-based educational system; financing the activities; and the need to aggregate the market in order to amortize large investments for equipment and production, while maintaining a diversity of educational offerings to satisfy local needs. In one sense, the basic difficulty in applying satellites to education is how to develop and apply techniques that can be highly effective, but which are economical only when applied on a mass basis, to insure that there is enough flexibility and variety so that education can be responsive to local needs and desires. The task is to apply satellites to education in order to improve the quality of education, reduce its cost, increase the availability of educational opportunity, and create possibilities for additional choice, yet do so without creating new problems that outweigh existing ones. This is the challenge to those who are making decisions about applying satellites to education that is raised in this paper."
"A graphical design procedure is presented based upon a QP triangle for the design of bipolar transistor (BJT) bias circuits. The design technique stresses quiescent point (QP) location on the IC-VCE characteristics and considers the effects of simultaneous variations in the BJT parameters hFE, VBE, and ICO upon QP location. The QP triangle method is developed for the standard one-battery BJT CE stage discussed in many introductory electronic circuits textbooks. The QP triangle method is applied to a specific CE stage which has to meet certain design specifications. One important specification is that the circuit must operate over the temperature range 25-100°C with silicon N-P-N BJT's having values of h<FE (25°C) > 40 and hFE 100°C) < 200. The available tradeoffs between the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp and the current gain AI are stressed and the best available design is selected. The performance of the selected design was simulated on a digital computer and measured in the laboratory. Both the computer simulation and the experiment are in good agreement with the design. The QP triangle method has been used in an introductory electronic circuits course with success for several years. Students understand this graphical design procedure and are able to apply it. It is recommended for beginning electronics students. An interactive computer program AMPDSN to aid students and instructors design the standard one-battery BJT CE stage is also described. An algorithm based upon the QP triangle is used. The program language is Basic."
"Mr. Sage, an ideal Professor, can motivate, evoke involvement, and supply rewards and reinforcement, for each individual student all within the same class period. Although his minimum standards require mastery of concepts at all levels of learning, from simple memory to creativity, he does not expect the same performance of all students. His grades are directly related to the breadth of subject matter and depth of mastery. He personalizes his instruction within the classroom and in homework assignments by a range in the difficulty of illustration, thereby challenging each student to his capacity. He uses tests and examinations as learning experiences. To achieve this he combines the excellent feature of the conventional system and the current views on personalized system of instruction."
"Traditionally automatic control laboratories are mainly devoted to study of the classical servoposition control system and rely heavily on electromechanical components. The purpose of this paper is to present two unusual experiments (a light control system and a temperature control system) which have been designed to illustrate the application of control theory to a wider class of problems."
"The stepping-stone algorithm is a widely taught procedure for solving transportation problems. However, instructional computer programs for it are scarce compared to those available for the simplex method. This correspondence describes an instructional computer program, Stepstone, that presents the stepping-stone algorithm in an easily followed manner for student use, while still having options which extends its use beyond purely instructional purposes."
"The design philosophy and implementation of a low-cost, modular digital communications system are presented. This system is suitable for laboratory experiments in sampling, time-division multiplexing (TDM), aliasing, pulse code modulation (PCM), quantization error, cross-talk, intersymbol interference, bandwidth requirements, noise performance, parity checking, and analog signal reconstruction. The system has been tested in an undergraduate laboratory with no failures and excellent student response. The entire system hardware costs under $500.00 and the system is expandable to include additional modules, both digital and analog."
"Modern digital simulation languages can facilitate the introduction of simulation techniques into existing undergraduate lectures and course work. In this paper, a digital computer program is written in Continuous System Modeling Program (CSMP) for the simulation of the starting transients of a three-phase ac induction motor. The program illustrates the manner in which a simulation language can minimize the intricacies of numerical analysis and computer programming and thus simplify the study of the dynamic behavior of ac and dc machines and other electromechanical devices."

 "As the subject matter is quite extensive only a few problems will be covered in this short presentation. I hope, however, to give you a clear picture of the in-company education and training system that will be described below. By following the instructions of the Chairman I hope I will be able to provide a basis for the ensuing discussion. This presentation is divided into the following subtopics. Section I. Organizational environment. Section II. Corporate view of continuing education. Section III. In-house educational opportunities. Section IV. External educational opportunities. Section V. Final remarks."
"Human resources is a term that refers collectively to employee potential for contributing individually and in concert to the achievement of an organization's objectives. Human resource management helps to assure the productivity and viability of the work force through recruiting, utilization, and development of the work force. Recruiting involves planning, attracting and screening candidates, and hiring of employees. Utilization involves guiding and leading employees to accomplish the desired work according to schedule, within cost, and to preset standards of performance. Development as one of the three major thrusts of human resource involves encouraging employees and providing means for their growth to cope with new and/or different job requirements and challenges. Career development is a complex, life-long learning process for producing and accumulating the relevant know-how, skills, art, and attributes used by engineers, managers, and other professionals who are the leaders of our society. Within the pertinent societal and organizational environment, career development seems to be influenced primarily by work assigments (80 percent); supervision and coaching (10 percent); career planning (3 percent); education (5 percent); and other activities (2 percent). Education is used broadly to include combinations of off-the-job training, indoctrination, instruction and studying that facilitate the production and accumulation of know-how, skills, art, and attributes."
"Hitachi, Ltd., a diversified electric company of Japan, has been enthusiastic in educating its employees since its foundation in 1910. It has given great support to the value of academic learning. This philosophy has promoted its engineering education, and counteracted a deficiency in the traditional lifelong employment system, effectively. The importance of On-the-Job Training (OJT) should be emphasized. However, engineering education at the corporate level is still needed. Hitachi has developed six programs to cover various academic and specialized areas. Methods for evaluation are discussed. Inquiries made at one to three years after the end of a course seem to be useful to confirm actual effects."
"Exxon Production Research Company (EPR) is one of two Exxon organizations that provide professional technical training in oil production for Exxon's worldwide operating affiliates. This training is highly job-oriented and is designed to include the latest developments in production technology. While various types of training are involved, the main types are in-house and on-site classroom training. Training needs are determined by interaction between EPR and the users of the training. Members of our research and development staff serve as instructors. In a few instances, the lecture is no longer used as the major means of transmitting information to the learner. Training is evaluated by before-and-after tests, performance reviews, and student critiques."
"This paper describes one corporation's commitment to employee training, and explains the functions and facilities of its new training center."
"This paper discusses the philosophy, organization, and rationale of the Continuing Education program for engineers and scientists at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, CA. The importance of diversified offerings designed to fit the needs of the individual is stressed, as is the recognition that continuing education is not necessarily confined to the traditional teacher-student relationship. The impact of the video cassette player is discussed for employees unable to meet rigid class schedules, as are the television links to the major universities in Northern California."
"The primary purpose of this paper is to describe the philosophy and operation of the Bell System Center for Technical Education (BSCTE), a center providing management technical training to Bell System employees. The center plays a major role in Bell System continuing education, but to view it in its proper perspective we should first take a broad look at what the Bell System is, and the importance of employee training to its total operation."
"Continuing education has been a way of life in IBM from the early days of the company. The educational activities in Rochester are fairly typical to all major domestic facilities and reflect a basic commitment of the corporation to provide an environment which supports personal growth and learning. Company support is available for all educational programs with applicability to current work or for future growth. The programs administered by the Education Department utilize a broad range of in-house capabilities and an equally wide range of outside facilities. Programs range from one-hour seminars to on-site Master of Science progams and on-campus graduate studies. The major thrust is in electrical engineering and computer sciences However, offerings even include discussion classes of the familiar Great Books program. These educational opportunities combined with other programs maintain the technical vitality of our people and provide firm support for personal gowth and learning."
"The Western Electric Corporate Education Center in Hopewell, NJ, was opened in 1969, centralizing the Company's corporate technical-professional and management educational programs under one roof. The technical-professional curricula is administered under the Graduate Engineering and Information Systems Program, which has gone through an evolutionary period over the years, changing when necessary to keep in the forefront of new knowledge and teaching methodologies. Two major technical curricula are taught at the Center-manufacturing and telecommunications engineering, and computer science and information systems. In addition to experienced company instructors, the teaching staff also consists of outside educators from local university faculties and specialized consultants. Over 2000 technical-professionals annually attend varied technical courses taught in modern campus-like facilities that can accommodate up to 300 resident students."

  "The present design of advanced engineering education does not meet the needs of the engineering manpower marketplace. Training in engineering practice needs to be reinforced. This is best accomplished by establishing professional schools of engineering, independent of conventional university graduate schools, and requiring at least two years of preengineering for admission. The first engineering degree should require an additional three years of professional training. Improvements in accreditation procedures, faculty qualifications, internships, and licensing are required. The substantial involvement of the professional societies is essential to success."
"Computer animation has great potential for the production of instructional aids. However, the sophistication of modern computer animation systems may be inappropriate in the educational environment, which has special requirements of low cost, simplicity and accessibility. A particular system which was designed to these requirements is described. A novel feature of the language is that it uses a block diagram description of the images and the motion. The experience of two years of using this system as a production tool is summarized."
"In September 1974, the Polytechnic Institute of New York (formerly the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn) offered undergraduate degree programs for the first time at its Long Island campus in Aerospace, Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. This paper describes the Freshman General Engineering Lab, GE 103, the first in a sequence of new undergraduate engineering laboratories that has been developed to support these new programs. GE 103 is a two-credit, four hours per week, laboratory required for all Freshman during their second semester. The course is designed with a three-fold purpose: 1) acquaint the incoming students with representative experiments and instrumentation in the various aforementioned engineering disciplines, 2) include experiments which illustrate, where possible, the application of theory taught in the first year physics lectures, and 3) coordinate the freshman computer course with this laboratory so that assigned computer problems are related to experiments performed. With these objectives in mind, GE 103 has been designed to function as an introductory engineering-physics laboratory. In this paper we describe how we implemented these goals and report the students' reactions to the course."
"Educational advantages and disadvantages of dynamical analogy and block-diagram models for interdisciplinary systems are discussed. If the system equations are known, a block-diagram is a useful tutorial alternative to the conventional dynamical analogy. It is easily drawn and yields a direct, graphical representation of the system equations with block elements that are not required to be physical elements of a specific discipline. Block diagrams illustrate system equations and processes quite differently from dynamical analogies and thereby provide new insights into system performance. They can also be used as alternative representations for linear circuits so that, in principle, it is possible to convert any dynamical analogy into a block diagram. A practical example is given wherein a combined electrical, mechanical, and acoustical system, normally studied using dynamical analogies, is modeled and analyzed with the aid of block diagrams Several interesting technical aspects of this specific, yet typical, interdisciplinary system are assessed."
"Most of the courses taken by engineering students deal with the analysis of given devices or systems rather than design. In fact, courses that teach design to a depth comparable to that of analysis are virtually unknown. As a consequence, students are not well prepared to function as designers when they begin their careers. They quickly gravitate to cut-and-try model building as a design procedure. A more desirable method is one wherein the equations of a mathematical model are structured in such a way as to allow noniterative solution for the unknown design variables. This is called synthesis. The usual impediment to the use of synthesis is that the designer does not develop a complete mathematical model. An important remedy is the careful identification of all specifications in mathematical terms. Another remedy of equal importance is the reduction of the design variables by piecemeal optimization. The author has been teaching this method in his design courses for the past fifteen years. Examples of its use are presented."
"A senior-graduate level course is described in which some of the material of traditional bioinstrumentation courses is presented in conjunction with laboratory applications of a minicomputer. During the course each student 1) learns aspects of the fundamental properties of bioelectrodes, transducers, and safe human biopotential measurement techniques, 2) uses a minicomputer as a laboratory instrument, and 3) initiates and completes two projects that require independent thinking, initiative, and careful execution. In the course of the computer applications the students 1) learn to use elements of a fairly sophisticated operating system (OS/8), 2) master a simple but powerful higher level computer language (Basic), 3) apply one or more sophisticated signal analysis programs to their biological data (time averaging, correlation, spectral analysis, time and post stimulus interval anaylsis), and 4) solve a \"real world\" problem that requires a nonsystem interface to the computer. The heavy emphasis on the laboratory portion of the course provides the opportunity for practical \"hands-on\" experience with bioinstrumentation and with computer based data acquisition, processing, and display techniques."
"This paper describes, in tutorial fashion, statistical procedures for educational experiments involving engineering laboratories. The sequence of the procedures is 1) formulation of the problem, 2) formulation of the hypotheses, 3) identification of the sample, 4) specification of the population, 5) construction of measuring items, 6) collecting data in cognitive and affective domains, 7) statistical analysis of the data, and 8) conclusions based on statistical analysis. This study was carried out at Michigan State University in an electrical engineering course (108 students). The statistical analysis was based on the outcome of four tests: pretest, posttest, retention test, and student attitude test."
"The need for training engineers in the use of information resources and retrieval techniques, and the advantages to be gained from such a training, are stressed. The possibility of replacing the foreign language proficiency requirement by such a training in doctoral degree programs is examined. Some of the anticipated arguments against this training are answered. Possible course contents and some operational problems are discussed."
"A matched filter is viewed as a cascade of a spectral-phase matched filter and a spectral-amplitude shading filter. The former provides the peak output in time, and the latter guarantees that that peak has maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or the latter may alternatively be chosen to provide better time resolution."

   "The Pioneer 10 and 11 science complement included 12 instruments on the spacecrafts, as well as several investigations which used the spacecraft radio beam for passive experiments. This paper will describe the results of the plasma, magnetic field, charged particle, ultraviolet, infrared, imaging, micrometeor-oid and radio investigations."
"The critical needs of nuclear science have motivated a trend toward distributed computer systems for data acquisition and control. Such systems combine the flexibility of distributed input/output systems with the capability of handling high data rates and critical control loops by localized intelligence and data reduction. Common problems of such systems such as data rate variations, analysis of alternative configurations, and utilization of standard modules are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the role of the microprocessor as a common component of the system."
"The potential hazards of the high level waste produced by one year of all nuclear power in the U. S. are calculated as a function of time for direct gamma radiation, inhalation, and ingestion, and scales are given for consequences of the worst credible handling. The probability for buried waste to be released into the environment by several pathways is estimated, and several factors of related interest are discussed."
"We have developed a computer program to study the magnitude and time dependence of the net power and net energy generated by an expanding system of identical power plants. Application of the program to several expansion modes over a range of values for the rate of expansion, the net energy generated by an individual plant, and the construction time for each plant has led to some interesting results concerning the impact of the expanding system on the overall energy picture. In particular, during a rapid expansion phase, the system of power plants may be a better means of energy storage than of energy generation."
 "The principle non-destructive assay systems used by the Agency in safeguards verification activities are passive techniques, particularly those which use signatures of gamma ray. The reason is that passive techniques are adaptable to the portable equipment of the international inspector. Further development and miniaturization of the portable equipment for nuclear material assay measurements depend strongly on the availability of semi-conductor gamma spectrometric detectors with significantly better resolving power than that of scintillation detectors and which can operate at room temperature. One of the most promising materials for such detectors is CdTe. This paper summarizes recent IAEA experience in the development and use of new semi-conductor spectrometric systems (mainly with CdTe detectors of different origins - USA, France, Czechoslovakia) and their use for nuclear material assay measurements."
"Studies with collimated low energy γ-ray beams show that for γ-ray interactions within a \"dead layer\" of thickness about 1 mm at the surface of a Ge detector, the pulse height distribution is characteristic of single carrier collection. Independent measurements of the charge transport parameters also show that the majority carriers in the surface channel do not contribute to the charge pulse."
"Techniques have been developed to consistently purify germanium to the 1010 atoms/cm3 range. The major impurities are the acceptors boron and aluminum and the donor phosphorous. Formation of nonsegregating compounds of boron and aluminum make these elements difficult to remove by conventional zone refining whereas phosphorous and all other electrically-active impurities segregate normally and are therefore removed in the zone refining process. The only significant impurity introduced in our Czochralski crystal puller is phosphorous whose source has been traced to the quartz crucible. To reliably reduce impurity concentrations to acceptable levels it has been necessary to develop techniques for determining the types and concentrations of impurities in both the final single crystals and in the polycrystalline zone-refined ingots and to relate these results to the use of various boat and crucible materials. Photothermal Ionization Spectroscopy and electrical measurements have been used to identify and measure the impurities."
"Germanium crystals with radial impurity gradients have been prepared by diffusing Li into p-type material and then extracting most of it at the surface to produce n-core crystals. The diffusion is designed to produce coaxial detectors which reach full depletion at the inner and outer radii simultaneously, thereby minimizing the leakage which is caused by electrical stress at the electrodes. The depletion voltage and leakage current of these crystals are measured by methods which do not require that they be sectioned to expose the junction. Preliminary measurements of detectors made from radial gradient crystals are also reported."
"The energy resolution of high-purity Ge detectors depends on the dislocation density and distribution in the single crystal. This correlation could be shown in a number of planar detectors with different dislocation densities. Scanning with collimated electrons and gamma-rays revealed the strong dependence of local detector performance on dislocation density."
"Fe-doped high purity GaAs crystals have been grown using a vertical-type liquid-phase epitaxial technique and have been studied as room temperature gamma-ray spectrometric detectors for nuclear fuel safeguards. To improve the detector gamma-ray counting efficiency, a double-epitaxial-layer detector was studied."
"Measurement results obtained with HgI2 detectors at room temperature in the low energy x-ray region down to 2 keV are reported. The best resolution obtained is 548 e V for 5.9 keV x-rays, and the 2.01 keV phosphorous x-ray line has been resolved with a detector with an area of 14 mm2. The different noise sources of the detector-amplifier system are analysed and polarization effects in the detectors are discussed. The mercuric iodide crystals were grown from the vapour phase by gradient reversal techniques."
"Tetragonal mercuric iodide single crystals were grown and applied to the fabrication of soft-gamma-ray detectors with high detection efficiencies and moderate energy resolutions. The studies included: 1) the dependency of single crystals grown by various techniques such as solution growth including recrystallization of the vapor transport grown crystal, vapor transport growth and temperature oscillation growth techniques on detector characteristics, 2) polarization effects, 3) electrical contacts problem, 4) fast-neutron-induced radiation damage and 5) linearity between pulse heights and energies. The detectors with various thicknesses from approximately 50 to 1000 microns were applied to the X-ray fluorescence analysis proved to be a very promising tool in this field for the linearity calibration and charge collection efficiencies examination of the detector of various thicknesses."
"Theoretical energy band structure calculations have been utilized to investigate several high-Z materials for potential use as ambient temperature radiation detectors. Using the pseudopotential technique, the band structure for HgI2 has been determined and the effective masses of the holes and electrons have been estimated. Theoretical mobilities of the electrons and holes as a function of temperature have been computed for HgI2 and CdTe and are compared to experimental data."
"Some recent results of an investigation of carrier transport in mercuric iodide detectors, using the pulsed laser induced transient photoinjection technique are reported. These results include measurements of carrier mobilities, trapping times, and reduced mobilities, as well as some observations of polarization effects. The applicability of the transient photoinjection technique to the study of wide bandgap meterials has been substantiated."
"A Monte-Carlo computational model has been developed to simulate the photon and electron spectral response in semiconductor detectors. Source photons from 10 eV to 1 GeV are three-dimensionally absorbed in detectors of almost arbitrary shape. One-dimensional charge collection in an arbitrary electric field profile includes trapping and electronics system effects. HgI2, CdTe, and Ge spectra, as well as full energy peak and absorption efficiency calculations, are made into the MeV range."
"Large Area reach-through avalanche diodes have been studied for use in room temperature X-ray spectroscopy applications. Gains in the range 10-80 have been measured, for diodes of area 12 and 25 mms2. Resolutions down to about 600 eV FWHM have been obtained for 5.9 keV X-rays. Various factors limiting resolution are discussed. The useful energy range is approximately 1.5 - 20 keV."
"An all epitaxial silicon avalanche diode (ESAD) having a total thickness of 36 μ (4 × 10-4 radiation lengths) has been fabricated. The design lends itself to the fabrication of thin detectors having an enhanced sensitivity to minimum ionizing particles. The uniformity of gain, signal to noise, and resolution of the detectors are studied. The response of the detector to minimum ionizing particles is measured."
"A careful analysis of the data provided by different characterization techniques (time of flight and thermally stimulated current measurements) allows one to precisely anticipate the nuclear detection properties of a CdTe sample. The paper shows how energy resolution and detection efficiency can be correlated to some physical properties of the material."
"Polarization has been studied in semi-insulating cadmium telluride compensated with chlorine. Several parameters have been considered including surface preparation, nature of the contact, temperature, as well as type and strength of the source. A model that assumes that the space charge region is produced by injected electrons being trapped by deep acceptors explains most of the effects observed. The possible nature of the center is discussed. Finally it is demonstrated that MIS structures are also a practical means to suppress the polarization."
"Highly perfect n-type CdTe single crystals grown by the sealed-ingot-zone refining method have been used to fabricate semiconductor surface-barrier detectors for X- and low-energ, γ-ray analysis. An energy resolution of 2.0 keV /fwhm/ and 1.5 keV /fwhm/ was achieved for 59.5 keV γ-rays from 241Am and 5.9 keV characteristic K X-ray line from 55Fe source, respectively. Spectra were measured at room temperature with low detector bias. The observed full energy peak of 59.5 keV γ-rays has been compared with the teoretical peak calculated for a surface-barrier junction with fixed space charge, the trapping effects being taken into account."
"Thermally stimulated current (TSC) has been measured in γ detector-grade, high resistivity CdTe:In and CdTe:In,Cl. Electron mobility-trapping time products, μτ+, measured at room temperature correlate strongly with the shape and magnitude of a prominent TSC band observed at 40 K. This correlation is used as the basis for a simple method of selecting samples appropriate for detector applications."
"The paper presents an interesting way of overcoming the well-known \"polarization effect\" in Cl-doped CdTe detectors. The detection efficiency is kept constant as long as the sample remains totally depleted, even though hole detrapping may occur from deep levels. Excellent stability has been checked for periods of time up to half an hour."
"High-temperature photomultipliers were studied to determine their performance characteristics as a function of temperature in the range of 20°C to 200°C. Photocathode sensitivity and thermionic emission were characterized. Pulse height, pulse-height resolution and plateau counting widths were studied with a simulated 137Cs scintillation source. Room temperature performance was not significantly degraded after repeated cycling to 200°C. Detailed results are reported."
"GaSe semiconductor detectors have been successfully tested during one year for monitoring muon beams in the GeV range in the neutrino experiment at CERN. Their performances are comparable with those of commercial Si surface barrier detectors for this particular application. Crystal growth, detec tor fabrication and characterization are briefly described. Various advantages (cost, ruggedness, resistance to radiation damage, manufacturing simplicity, etc.) are discussed."
"Simple radiation monitors of coaxial ionization chambers are used at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to measure targeting efficiency of the external proton beam as it impinges on secondary particle production targets in the experimental areas. In some cases the system replaces the traditional target telescope formed of three scintillation counters connected in triple coincidence. When the target monitor is recessed in shielding, target-in, target out ratios of over 100 are achieved. A single, unshielded monitor residing near the target yields a ratio of 10 for 300 GeV incident protons on a tungsten target 120 mils in diameter by 2 in. long. A companion background monitor allows this ratio to be increased by at least an order of magnitude. Evidence indicates that these simple detectors, properly located, constitute a viable target monitoring system which has operated with incident proton beams having intensity rates ranging from < 1011 protons sec-1 to > 1013 protons in 20 μsec."
 "A new technique for measuring the number of tracks per unit area in a Dielectric Track Detector uses the energy spectrum of alpha particles transmitted through the detector. The spectrum contains two components. One is a low-energy peak due to alpha particles transmitted through the bulk material. The other is due to higher energy alphas that are transmitted through craters and lose less energy. The ratio of the number of higher energy alphas to the total number of alphas in the spectrum gives the fraction of area occupied by craters and hence the track density."
"Cerenkov light pulses were generated in one end of 100-m lengths of multi-fiber cable and a single strand of graded index fibers by a 50-ps burst of 18-MeV electrons. Pulse dispersion in this length was between 3.5 and 2.9 ns for the cabled fibers and 4.1 ns in the single fiber. By narrow band optical filtering, the dispersion was reduced to values between 610 and 246 ps in the cable and 400 ps for the single fiber. Cerenkov sensitivity was measured for two of the fibers and found to be 6 × 1013 photons/sec and 6 × 1012 photons/ sec for 50 ps electron bursts of 10 A/cm2 and 6 A/cm2 respectively. In terms of time response and sensitivity it appears feasible to design a nuclear explosive diagnostic system utilizing Cerenkov radiation generated in and transmitted by cables of graded index fibers."
"A technique is described for the measurement of particle trajectory angle through a pair of scintillator tiles. Signal processing provides an analog signal proportional to the tangent of the angle between the particle trajectory and the axis normal to the pair of tiles. This signal is readily available for use in fast decision logic if required: i.e., sorting energy loss signals from the tiles according to geometrical factors or restricting the events to be analyzed on the basis of incident direction."
"A review is presented of design considerations for GaAs Schottky-barrier FETs and other types of transistors in low-noise amplifiers for capacitive sources which are used in nuclear radiation detectors and high speed fiber-optic communication systems. Ultimate limits on performance are evaluated in terms of the gm/Ci ratio and the gate leakage current to minimize the noise sources. Si bipolar transistors and the future prospects of GaAs, Si and InAs MISFETs are discussed, and performance is compared to FETs currently being used in low-noise preamplifiers."
"The transfer function comprised of (2n+1) poles unit spaced in the ω direction on the line s=-D in the s plane is analyzed in the time domain and shown to have the response Fn(t)= Cne-Dtsin2n(t/2), providing a clean pseudo-gaussian pulse. If D=1.5, the after-pulses gre theoretically down by about a factor of 8 × 10-5 and are experimentally acceptable. Experimentally, such an analog signal processor (D=1.5, n=3, unit time = 20 us.) shows excellent shift vs. input rate."
"A dual channel constant fraction timing discriminator incorporating multiple energy windows and coincidence logic has been developed. Incorporation of energy discrimination and fast coincidence logic into the timing channel has distinct advantages in terms of system simplicity, stability and data rates. A prototype applying the F2 approach has been constructed and tested. The system gives a Co60 FWHM of ~ 210 psec at a singles rate of > 7.5 × 105 sec-1 (~ 1200 coincidences/sec)."
"A constant fraction timing system having excellent time derivation properties over a wide dynamic range of signals is described. Leading edge walk is significantly reduced by arming the constant fraction zero-crossing circuit with a discriminator that is separate from the energy discriminator. Timing resolution with Ge(Li) detectors can be improved by the optional use of a slow risetime reject circuit, but only at the expense of reduced counting efficiency. This performance trade-off is described in detail. Extensive data are presented on the timing performance in γ-γ coincidence experiments."
"The chance coincidences in a triple-coincidence circuit are of two types - partially correlated and entirely uncorrelated. Their relative importance depends on source strength and source and detector geometry so that the total chance correction cannot, in general, be calculated. The system to be described makes use of several delays and straightforward integrated circuit logic to provide independent evaluation of the two components of the chance coincidence rate."
"A Drift Chamber Time Digitizer System has been designed which combines direct counting and time stretching techniques. By time stretching for only the low order bits, most logic can be low power Schottky TTL allowing 3 channels of 3 ns time resolution in a single width CAMAC module while holding conversion time to less than 1μs."
"A summary of a comprehensive analysis of theoretical and practical aspects of position sensing by charge division from resistive electrodes is presented. Properties of transformer decoupling of the resistive electrode from detection bias voltage are analyzed and compared to the usual capacitive decoupling methods. Optimization and limitation of signal shaping is discussed as a function of diffusion time constant, signal rise times, and noise."
"Two systems of two-dimensional proportional chamber readout are presented, using digital hardware techniques. Centre-of-cluster readout is simple, cheap and very fast: 100 nsec dead-time. Centre-of-gravity readout is slower, with a dead-time of 1 μsec, but capable of considerable electronic spatial resolution: 10 μm FWHM from 3 mm spaced channels. With this resolution the asymmetry of avalanche formation on anode wires has been observed."
 "A proportional chamber readout scheme has been developed which stores each-wire's data in a 40 MHz \"shift register\" while a decision to retain an event is made. System delay, resolving time and storage time are adjustable parameters and multiple hits on a wire, within the storage time, are retained."
"A new monolithic 8-channel PMOS integrated circuit has been developed for an experiment to be carried out on the CERN 300 GeV accelerator. The circuit, read-out electronics and tests performed on 12 large MWPC (total of 48 000 channels) are described and the results are presented."
"The delay line readout technique was adapted to proportional chambers using electronegative gas mixtures. This requires lines with improved rise time, but allows somewhat shorter delays; at the same time, we improved the two-pulse resolution. Our new line is 55cm long, has a delay to rise time ratio of 50 for a delay of 2.1 μs; two pulse resolution in the middle of the line is of the order of 15mm for equal amplitude pulses. We also investigated aluminum core and printed circuit delay lines. We found that the first ones are well suited for low to medium delays with medium two pulse resolution; the second ones are adapted to low delays and may have extremely good delay to rise time ratio in the differential stripline configuration."
"This paper describes some of the system features of a large array of instrumentation to be used for data collection in an experiment utilizing multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) of both the amplifierper-wire and the delay-line types. The system is designed to uniquely meet special functional requirements for background reduction and dead-time reduction in high counting-rate experiments at FERMILAB."
"The Hazard Inspector is a CAMAC module which divides a MWPC delay line into 8 independent signal monitor and control segments. Independent control effectively reduces delay line occupation time and cuts the number of background and non-trigger particles accepted by the 4XQT charge-time-pulse-width digitizer, a device presented in a separate communication. Only segments containing legitimate information are digitized. Non-trigger related events are gated out at the digitizer, and contaminating hits are noted for computer correction."
"A discriminator has been developed for digitizing both intercepted total charge and location of electromagnetic shower and particle trajectories in multiwire proportional chambers read by delay lines. Determination of shower trajectory is aided by video signal integration followed by centroid-locating discrimination. Calibrated run-down of the signal integrating capacitor gives the charge information above a given threshold level. The discriminator is designed to handle up to four shower-induced video signals per event by incorporating steering circuits within the module. Each video signal is examined for time over an adjustable threshold. Video pulses with separation of less than 20 nsec are treated as a single pulse. Counter-logic circuits indicate the number of video signals digitized. These signal processing circuits provide a first level of data sifting which otherwise must be carried out with additional discriminator channels and added complexity in data recognition."
"A computer-based system for foil counting uses four sample changers with NaI and two with Ge(Li) detectors. The computer controls the sample changers, performs timing, operates a CRT display, acquires data from scalers and ADCs and writes data on magnetic tape. CAMAC is used for part of the system interfacing."
"Techniques for both hardware and software development of microprocessor systems are discussed. A crossassembler, written for execution on a 16-bit control computer, is used to assemble programs and produce binary output tapes for programming read-only memories. A modular 8-bit microprocessor system has been developed that includes a bus-oriented card file and a group of analog and digital I/O interface cards. This has proved to be a flexible and inexpensive method of implementing a variety of one-of-a-kind microprocessor applications in a laboratory environment."
 "Feature of the present system is the use of the developed low noise current-sensitive preamplifier, counting loss compensation pulse rate-meter and fast response true-mean-square circuit. Noise level of the preamplifier is 10 PA/√Hz for 30 cable system. True mean square circuit operated at 100 KHz has a response time constant of 10 msec and a wide output range over 6 decades without level switching."
"A multi-chamber fission array has been designed, fabricated, and tested with integrated and condensed electronic circuitry. The intention was to develop an array of over 100 channels of detectors able to cover the high power range of TREAT transients in conjunction with the fast neutron hodoscope. The array has been developed through a prototype stage consisting of 31 possible channels. A wide variety of operating conditions have been tested, including choice of fissile isotope, coating thickness, gas filling, plate spacing, high voltage, and electronic circuitry. The configuration tested at TREAT consisted of ten active channels incorporated in a doubly contained system. Miniaturized electronic circuits are appended almost directly to the parallel plates of the fission counters. Cost and space limitations were major factors in the design."
"A mathematical model of a rhodium self-powered neutron detector has been developed to investigate the detector transfer function and to apply this transfer function as compensation for the inherent time delay in the rhodium-neutron interaction. The various reactions that comprise the detector signal have been evaluated experimentally and the resultant transfer function compensation has been tested in the field against a prompt responding ion chamber during a reactor trip."
"Two types of infrared heavy-water monitors, designed for on-line use at CANDU nuclear power stations and at heavy-water production plants, are described. These monitors are capable of measuring excess concentrations of D2O in H2O (or H2O in D2O) to a few parts per million. Problems associated with changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature and water purity, are discussed, together with methods used to reduce the effects of these changes."
"A feeder-scanning technique that involves the measurement of γ-ray fields on individual fuel-channel outlet-feeder pipes has been used successfully to locate failed fuel bundles in shutdown CANDU-PHW reactors at the Pickering G.S. High-resolution spectroscopic measurements show that the excess γ-ray fields on the outlet feeders of channels containing fuel failures are due primarily to deposited fission products, all with half-lives longer than 56 hours."
"The engineering and operational requirements for failed-fuel location systems in CANDU* reactors are constantly evolving and the effects of these changes on system design are discussed, with particular reference to the location system for the Bruce G. S. An experimental program to optimize the counting arrangement for the Bruce failed-fuel location system is described in detail."
 "A multivariate statistical pattern recognition system for reactor noise analysis was developed. The basis of the system is a transformation for decoupling correlated variables and algorithms for inferring probability density functions. The system is adaptable to a variety of statistical properties of the data, and it has learning, tracking, and updating capabilities. System design emphasizes control of the false-alarm rate. The ability of the system to learn normal patterns of reactor behavior and to recognize deviations from these patterns was evaluated by experiments at the ORNL High-Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Power perturbations of less than 0.1% of the mean value in selected frequency ranges were detected by the system."
"The fast neutron hodoscope at TREAT can be modified for high resolution radiography. Time-resolved radiography normally performed by the hodoscope with coarse spatial resolution may be traded for good space definition at the expense of time resolution, allowing the hodoscope to become a dual purpose instrument. The modifications require remote motorized scanning of the collimator and simultaneous 334-channel data collection over extended intervals of time. By doing so, it becomes possible to generate digital radiographs without the necessity for mechanical disturbance of the object being viewed. Furthermore, separate and distinct images of fuel and steel may be produced."
"The regulatory agencies and federal codes stipulate certain minimum levels of sensitivity for the sampling and analysis of effluents from nuclear facilities. A device for enhancing sample concentration was designed and installed in the gaseous radwaste system of an operating nuclear power plant. A 180-liter gas sample was compressed into a small calibrated container for gamma spectroscopy. The resulting spectra were analyzed by an on-line programmable calculator with consideration given to offgas system delay times and fission yields for various components in order to accurately establish minimum detection limits. The data from a single sample is correlated with the continuous effluent monitor readings to determine the quantity of radionuclides released for a period of one month."
"Using prior knowledge or assumptions about possible distributions of the two phases, the average density and the density distribution of a two-phase fluid in a pipe can be determined with a two-beam radiation attenuation densitometer. The procedure for using such a system is outlined and illustrated with an example."
"An ultrasonic level measurement system which provides a continuous digital readout over a range of 3 to 180 inches, was tested in 500°F liquid sodium. The system proved to be accurate and reliable, required no initial warm-up period and experienced no long term drift. Modifications can extend the present operating temperatures to greater than 1200°F."
"Performance of four different types of fuel failure detection systems has been studied using a sodium in-pile loop located in Japan Research Reactor No. 2. In the sodium in-pile loop, 8.5 liter sodium circulates through an irradiation section (500°C), a main cooler (400°C), an expansion tank (380°C), an electromagnetic pump, and a main heater at a flow rate of 3 liters/min. In the irradiation section, four metallic uranium (20% enriched) plates of a total amount of U-235 of 9.18g had been irradiated at a thermal neutron flux of 5.4×1010 n/cm2sec. A delayed neutron detector consisting of a BF3 counter system in a graphite moderator (50cm×5Ocm×8Ocm) detects delayed neutrons from fission products in the expansion tank. Helium cover gas over the sodium in the expansion tank carries gaseous fission products to a precipitator (The Plessey Co. Ltd., Mark XI) by which beta-rays from Rb-88 and Cs-138 collected on the precipitator wire are detected. The precipitator was modified to measure gamma-ray spectra from the wire using a Ge(Li) detector system for the nuclide identification. The helium gas is also guided into a gas reservoir whose gamma-ray spectra are analysed by another Ge(Li) detector system. Construction and performance of these detection systems was described in detail and their detection sensitivities and response were compared."
 "A system has been developed for monitoring plant dynamic behavior using Power Spectral Density measurements. The data are taken and compared with frequency-dependent limits automatically under computer control. Historical data is maintained and is recallable by the operator for comparison with current data."
"A conductivity-sensitive liquid level detector has been desianed for the pressurized water reactor environment of the Loss-of-Fluid Test (LOFT) reactor at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Test results indicate the detector is not only capable of indicating liquid level, but also oscillatory behavior in the two-phase fluid. Test data are presented along with a brief description of the detector design."
"A boron trace control/alarm system has been designed and installed for pressurized water reactors. It is the first centralized control that meets IEEE 338 \"Criteria for Periodic Testing of Nuclear Power Generating Station Systems\". This paper deals with a case study of a control system specifically designed for the temperature control and alarming of a boron dumping system in a pressurized water reactor plant; a subject that, until recently, was frequently an afterthought in nuclear plant construction planning. Considering that many engineers and architects are now beginning to develop new standards for this function, this review of the system for Florida Power and Light's St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 should prove a significant guide for boron heat trace control planning."
"A computer network for real-time data acquisition, monitoring and control of a series of experiments at the Brookhaven High Flux Beam Reactor has been developed and has been set into routine operation. This Reactor Experiment Control Facility presently services nine neutron spectrometers and one x-ray diffractometer. Several additional experiment connections are in progress. The architecture of the facility is based on a distributed function network concept as introduced and defined elsewhere. This paper is a statement of implementation and results."
"A computer network architecture consisting of a common node processor for managing peripherals and files and a number of private node processors for laboratory experiment control has been given elsewhere. The mode of comnmunication between the nodes is that of the transaction. The procedures and data structures used to manage both logical and physical resources required during processing of a transaction by the common node are discussed."
"In a functionally distributed computer system, the system function is partitioned into less complex functions which reside at decreasing functional hierarchy levels. At some point in the partitioning process, all software and hardware required to implement an identified function are confined to a node of the system. The type of hardware elements and the form of the software required at the node are determined by the node function. This principle is illustrated in the case of a task scheduler for the common node of a distributed function laboratory computer system having a star-like configuration."
"An attempt to partition along functional lines a computer system for control of and data collection from a set of laboratory experiments leads to the notion of sharing of peripheral devices. Peripheral devices can be shared in two fundamentally different ways, reserved for discrete periods of time or continuously shared. The design and implementation of a subsystem to handle the continuous sharing of a record-oriented device is discussed."
"The centralized dual computer system philosophy has evolved as the key concept underlying the highly successful application of direct digital control in CANDU power reactors. After more than a decade, this basic philosophy bears re-examination in the light of advances in system concepts - notably distributed architectures. A number of related experimental programs, all aimed at exploring the prospects of applying distributed systems in Canadian nuclear power plants are discussed. It was realized from the outset that the successful application of distributed systems depends on the availability of a highly reliable, high capacity, low cost communications medium. Accordingly, an experimental facility has been established and experiments have been defined to address such problem areas as interprocess communications, distributed data base design and man/machine interfaces. The design of a first application to be installed at the NRU/NRX research reactors is progressing well."
"The advent of CAMAC has had an important influence on the way in which systems are synthesized to meet the needs of data-acquisition, control and interactive computation in a laboratory environment. The modularity, standardization and widespread availability of CAMAC hardware, and the increasing standardization of conventional software packages have contributed greatly to the solution of highly complex system problems. In these problems, data networks are assuming a role of increasing importance. The present paper discusses these developments in the context of work done at Daresbury Laboratory, and illustrates them with specific examples."
"A high speed network communications station has been developed to serve to interconnect a variety of computers in a multiplexed star network. Each station consists of one control module and two memory modules embodied as CAMAC modules. Transmission is over coaxial lines with typical distances between stations of from 1 to 2 miles."
"Communications between the central control computer and remote, satellite data acquisition/control stations at The Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) is presently accomplished through the use of CAMAC based Data Link modules. With the advent of the microprocessor, a new philosophy for digital data communications has evolved. Data Link modules containing microprocessor controllers provide link management and communication network protocol through algorithms executed in the Data Link microprocessor."
"The need for further sophistication of an already complex serial CAMAC control system at Fermilab lead to the development of an Auxiliary/Master CAMAC Crate Controller. The controller contains a Motorola 6800 microprocess- or, 2K bytes of RAM and 8K bytes of PROM memory. Bussed dataway lines are time shared with CAMAC signals to provide memory expansion and direct addressing of peripheral devices without the need of external cabling. The Auxiliary/Master Crate Controller (A/MCC) can function as either a Master, i.e., stand alone, crate controller or as an Auxiliary controller to Fermilab's Serial Crate Controller (SCC). Two modules, one single and one double-width, make up an A/MCC. The double-width module contains the necessary crate controller hardware, i.e., read/write registers, station number registers, dataway cycle timing generator, etc. in addition to hardware providing input and output block transfer capabilities through the SCC. When the A/MCC is used as an auxiliary controller, the single-width module contains the microprocessor, RAM, PROM, MPU clock, and the timing and logic circuitry required for interleaving A/MCC and SCC dataway cycles as well as extending memory via dataway lines. When the A/MCC is functioning as a master crate controller, the first single-width module or one with DMA cycle-stealing transfer capabilities may be used. The module, in this latter case, need not and thus does not have dataway cycle interleaving capabilities. The microprocessor has one nonmaskable and one maskable vectored interrupt. The maskable interrupt has eight sublevels of vectored interrupts for ease of interrupt prioritizing and servicing."
"A Serial Driver has been developed at The Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) for use in accelerator control and beam-line data-acquisition applications. The driver fully meets the requirements of the CAMAC Serial System Description (ERDA TID-26488 and ESONE/SH/01) while providing a number of features useful in system operation, diagnosis, and testing of SCC-L1 crate controllers."
"An event-oriented, modular software system for data acquisition in nuclear physics experiments has been implemented on PDP-11 computers under the RSX-11D operating system. The system is designed to support high-speed data acquisition in a broad variety of nuclear physics experiments having multiple event types and using CAMAC instrumentation as the experimental interface. The system provides a simple, problem-oriented language for the specification of CAMAC operations to acquire data from each class of event. It provides automatic bufferinq of experimental data from the CAMAC hardware and recording on magnetic tape. Certain common utility functions are provided, especially histogram entries and plotting on on-line displays, along with associated operator control functions. The experimenter specializes the system to his needs by writing FORTRAN subroutines which specify necessary on-line analysis of data and control histogram entry. The software depends on a special event-trigger module which was designed in conjunction with the software and is used to identify the various different classes of events, to facilitate manual control and testing of an experiment, and to facilitate comnmunication between different software modules in the system."
"A minicomputer based CAMAC automation system for simultaneous operation of independent analytical instruments is described. An approach to application software development in a real-time multi-user environment is discussed. The necessity of using queued I/O for the CAMAC branch driver is emphasized. Various techniques for efficient main memory management are also outlined."
"A measurement program to investigate the performance of CdTe gamma-ray detectors after bombardment with 33-MeV protons has been undertaken in order to evaluate the effects of energetic protons encountered on earth-orbiting satellites. The pulse heights and energy resolutions of the 59.6 keV line from Am241 and the 122 keV line from Co57 and the leakage currents of the detectors were monitored as a function of proton fluence. Of the two types of CdTe detectors tested, far greater radiation effects were observed in those obtained from Tyco (chlorine doped) than in the sensor obtained from Hughes (indium doped). In the former detectors the relative pulse heights appeared to decrease slowly with increasing fluence up to about (5-9) × 109 protons/cm2 beyond which the gain degraded at a faster rate. The energy resolution and leakage currents were observed to improve at moderate fluence levels near (1-3) × 109 protons/cm2. In one of the two chlorine doped sensors tested, the intrinsic detector resolution at 59.6 keV improved from 4.3 keV to 2.6 keV at a fluence of 2 × 109 protons/cm2 and subsequently degraded beyond its original performance level after 5 × 109 protons/cm2."
"A gas scintillation proportional counter operating without the conventional gas purification system, for use in instruments for X-ray astronomy, is under development. A parallel grid detector has been built employing ultra high vacuum technology, equipped with a caesium getter to maintain purity, filled with xenon at one atmosphere and sealed. The detector does not employ a wavelength shifter (the scintillation being in the UV region) and no attention was paid to optimising the light collection efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the output signal is in the form of a pulse-train, which offers unforeseen possibilities for direct digital energy measurements, involving high frequency pulse counting and pulse-train length discrimination for the vetoing of particles producing extended ionisation trails."
"Thin flat slabs of scintillator are a useful means of measuring angular location of gamma-ray fluxes of astronomical interest. A statistical estimate of position error has been made of two scintillator systems suitable for gamma-ray burst location from a balloon or satellite platform. A single rotating scintillator with associated flux monitor is compared with a pair of stationary orthogonal scintillators. Position error for a strong burst is of the order of a few arcmin if systematic errors are ignored."
"A satellite-borne, high-sensitivity crystal X-ray spectrometer and an X-ray polarimeter have been orbited in the OSO-8 spacecraft. In the quiet Sun or solar-flare mode, the spectrometer records a spectrum of solar X-rays from 1.4 to 8 keV every 10 s. In the stellar mode, the instrument measures the spectra from 2 to 8 keV of celestial X-ray sources. The focusing crystal X-ray polarimeter measures the polarization of X-ray emission at 2.6 and 5.2 keV from celestial sources."
"The HEAO-B Imaging Proportional Counter is an X-ray imaging instrument designed for use in an orbiting observatory. It measures the spatial location and energy of individual X-ray photons by the risetime method and pulse height analysis respectively. The IPC can locate 0.1 to 4keV photons to within 1mm, and provides five bits of energy information. The IPC also includes an in-flight calibration source and a gas control system that maintains the counter gas density constant to an accuracy of 0.25%."
"Aeronutronic Ford has developed a rugged, miniature, room temperature operable, gamma ray detector package containing a CdTe photon detector, a charge amplifier and a pulse shaper circuit. Photon detection efficiencies between 10% and 40% are achieved for various photon energies between 100 KEV and 1000 KEV in a detector area of .032 square inches. The resuling package weights ~8 grams and occupies ~0.1 cubic inch. Prototypes have been tested for aging and temperature effects on gamma detection efficiency. The intended application of the device is calibrated gamma ray counting in a warm environment while subjected to high intensity acoustic and vibration stresses as well as very large linear accelerations."
"A miniaturized, flight proven gamma sensor embodying a CdTe device has been developed for applications of gamma backscatter to measurement of heat shield recession and nosetip shape change. A 10 mm diameter by 2 mm thick chlorine doped CdTe gamma detector operated at circa 50 volts bias was combined with an unusual preamplifier employing tripolar pulse shaping. The package, which incorporates mechanical isolation, damping, and component rigidization, has operated satisfactorily under test at a random vibration level of 2 gc2/Hz and peak sinusoidal acceleration of 10,000 ge at a frequency of 24 kHz. Several of these gamma sensors have been flown in a single vehicle to obtain measurements of changes in nosetip shape."
 "A light-sensitive, self-scanning, silicon diode array has been used to interface an image-intensifier gamma camera to a digital computer for performing high resolution dynamic radionuclide angiocardiography. The spatial resolution of this image-intensifier camera (IIC) system, which does not perform pulse-height analysis, is somewhat worse than that of the Anger camera (AC) at count-rates below 50 K cps. Between 50 K and 250 K cps the IIC demonstrates linear countrate performance without the distortion and resolution loss associated with the AC. The ability of the IIC to maintain resolution at extremely high count-rates is of particular value for performing first transit, radionuclide bolus washout studies of cardiac dynamics. The high contrast and increased information density achieved by this approach provides accurate measurement of left ventricular volume and its first derivative with respect to time as verified by direct comparison with left cine ventriculography (cine). For the study of regional left ventricular wall motion, radionuclide images corresponding to end-diastole and end-systole have been used to compute functional images which accurately describe abnormally contracting segments of the left ventricular wall. The ability to study left ventricular volume and segmental wall motion without left heart catheterization is of significant diagnostic and investigative value."
 "A multiwire proportional chamber positron camera consisting of four 48 × 48 cm2 detectors linked to a small digital computer has been designed, constructed, and characterized. Initial clinical application to brain imaging using 68Ga DTPA in 10 patients with brain tumors is described. Tomographic image reconstruction is accomplished by an algorithm determining the intersection of the annihilation photon paths in planes of interest. Final image processing utilizes uniformity correction, simple thresholding, and smoothing. The positron brain images were compared to conventional scintillation brain scans and x-ray computerized axial tomograms (CAT) in each case. The positron studies have shown significant mitigation of confusing superficial activity resulting from craniotomy in comparison to conventional brain scans. Central necrosis of lesions observed in the positron images, but not in the conventional scans, has been confirmed in CAT. Modifications of the camera are being implemented to improve image quality, and these changes combined with the tomography inherent in the positron scans are anticipated to result in images superior in information content to conventional brain scans."
"Two Anger scintillation cameras have been combined into a positron imaging system. Count rate capability has been extended by using absorbers to reduce scattered radiation from the object, by using 1\" thick crystals to improve detection efficiency for annihilation radiation, and by implementing pulse shortening techniques and low dead time D. C. coupled electronics. The main characteristics of the device in its present form are high sensitivity (200 cts/sec/μCi), high resolution (system resolution less than 10 mm FWHM) and useful clinical count rates up to 8000 cts/sec."
"Following exposure to room ambient air, the radiation response of orthogonal strip detectors fabricated from high purity germanium for use in a gamma camera has been found to undergo deterioration due to changes which take place at the exposed surfaces between the electrode strips and at the edges of each device. Based upon data obtained from small test detectors subjected to a commercial passivation process, long term stability (greater than one year) following room ambient exposure appears feasible."
"A high-efficiency detector system developed especially for medical imaging has three speciall cut Ge(Li) coaxial detectors (total volume 249 cm3). At 122 keV, the peak efficiency is 93% of that of a 7.6 × 7.6 cm NaI (T1) detector. Degradation of the paralleled energy resolution is avoided and resolution is improved by 35% over that of conventional output-summing techniques by gating the detector outputs. In effect this multiplexes them to a single line output."
"The fat and fat-free (muscle) constituents of soft tissue have mass absorption coefficients which are sufficiently separated in the 10-100 keV range as to allow the relative proportions of each of these components to be non-destructively determined by photon absorptiometry. The use of a dual photon beam eliminates variations due to sample density and thickness, thus making the method suitable for in vivo as well as in vitro work."
"A system is described for measuring the amount of bone and soft tissue in a path through any point in a radiograph. The basic information required is the transmitted intensity with two different source spectra. It is shown experimentally that this data may be used to accurately calculate the bone and soft tissue thicknesses."
"Camera scans of phantoms and kidneys are computer processed to extract boundaries between areas of different densities. Several methods of edge detection are critically evaluated for their ability to determine boundaries in the presence of stochastic noise. A second order polynomial fit, utilizing the nearest neighbor method was found to be the most efficient method yielding the most consistent results for varying signal to noise ratios."
"The pseudo fan beam reconstruction algorithm and related physical problems are considered. Image distortion related to the rearrangement to a parallel beam from a fan beam scan is discussed together with physical problems such as Compton scattering in tissue which affects the final image quality."
"A number of existing cameras for Nuclear Medicine imaging of radio-isotope distributions give depth information about the distribution. These devices have in common that they provide tomographic images of the object, that is, that images of a given object plane have that plane in focus and all other object planes contribute an out-of-focus background superimposed on the in-focus image. We present here a method for three dimensional reconstruction of these axial tomographic images which removes the blurred off-plane activity from a number of transverse planes simultaneously. The method is applicable to a number of tomographic cameras, such as the multiple single-pinhole camera, the rotating slanted-hole collimator, the Anger focussing tomographic scanner, and the positron camera. The method can be implemented on a small computer having a disc system."
"The metabolic significance of the distribution of labeled oxygen was studied in the dog by inhalation of gas mixtures labeled with oxygen-14 (T1/2 = 71 seconds) maintained at a constant level of activity. Under steady-state conditions, whole body images were developed by detection of the positron annihilation emissions with a dual head rectilinear scanner in the coincidence mode."
"Radiations other than those of the electromagnetic spectrum or of sound may be used for diagnosis. These consist of beams of sub-atomic particles, particularly of protons and heavy ions. With these beams radiographs of unusually high contrast are obtained for the visualization and differentiation of the bodily tissues at very low doses. The method is practical for use in hospitals and has potential for screening purposes."
"Positron-emitting 78-sec 82Rb obtained from a 82Sr (25 day) nuclide generator is used with a multicrystal positron camera for serial non-invasive myocardial scanning. Progress in application of this generator for myocardial scintigraphy from December, 1974 to September, 1975 is reported. Physical characteristics of the generator and scanning system were examined with the aid of phantom models. Myocardial scanning was carried out in an open chest canine myocardial infarct preparation and in normal human subjects. It is concluded that positron scintigraphy with 82Rb permits rapid non-invasive assessment of regional myocardial perfusion at intervals of several minutes."
 "A compact CdTe detector system was developed for use in a clinical screening test for venous thrombosis of the legs. Patients given intravenously administered autologous I-125-fibrinogen were probed externally at selected points on the thighs and calves for abnormal accumulations of radioactivity. Measurements made with the CdTe probe were compared to those obtained with a standard portable NaI detector system. The CdTe probe was the equal of the NaI detector in diagnostic capability. The compact design of the semiconductor system considerably eased the probing procedure, especially in bedridden patients with limited mobility of the extremities."
"The non-invasive determination of absolute lung density would be of great importance if it could be used in the evaluation of patients with pulmonary edema. To obtain this measurement, we have developed a a portable densitometer using CdTe room-temperature detectors, compact collimators made of tantalum tubes and a Gd-153 source. System response in the density range of 0.1 to 1 g/cm3 is linear. Variations in the absorption paths of up to 8 cm of lucite do not produce significant changes on measured density values."
"We derive a rigorous expression for the three-dimensional point response function associated with the combined encoding-decoding process of coded aperture imaging. From this general expression we derive the two-dimensional point response function appropriate to a coded aperture imaging system which images a two-dimensional slice through a, three-dimensional source distribution. This point response function is then calculated numerically for a number of different aperture coding functions and decoding functions. The graphed results suggest that simple modifications of the decoding function can lead to significant improvements in the depth resolving capability of a coded aperture imaging system. Suggestions for future research are given."
"The transverse axial 3-dimensional image reconstruction concepts developed in transmission tomography brought the nuclear medicine and diagnostic radiology into the realm of quantitative analysis of the 3-dimensional image hitherto superimposed in two dimensions. Two factors make it appropriate to design a positron camera system at this time, (1) analogy between the emission of photons following a positron annihilation and the transmission of photons, and (2) the already demonstrated success of positron camera multidetector systems. The camera consists of one layer of 64 (or 72) NaI(T1) crystals and PM tubes that simultaneously record coincidences from 2 × 736 (or 2 × 1116) detector combinations in a circular array."
"The effect of polychromaticity on the reconstruction of attenuation coefficients from X-ray transmissions is presented by computer simulations of two simple phantoms. The distortions resulting from different amounts of X-ray beam hardening along different paths can be reduced by an equivalent water path analysis and a two parameter energy independent analysis. The first method transforms the projected paths into equivalent (i.e., same total transmission) water path lengths. The second method uses two spectra to factor out the energy independent parts of the photoelectric and Compton coefficients. This solution also involves conversion into equivalent water path lengths."
"The spatial frequency aliasing properties of orthogonal strip electrode, position sensing germanium detectors have been investigated both analytically and experimentally. The study demonstrates that alising is a property of strip electrode detectors but not necessarily a property of strip electrode cameras. Aliasing in gamma cameras can be eliminated using the collimator and spatial channel electronics as anti-aliasing spatial frequency filters. The system resolution of a strip electrode gamma camera is determined by the collimator resolution and the intrinsic detector resolution. The collimator resolution is a function of the source depth while the intrinsic detector resolution is a function of the strip width spacing and the spatial channel readout electronics. The elimination of aliasing limits the overall spatial resolution of a camera to 1.7 to 2.3 times the strip width spacing depending on readout technique. It should be noted that this is not the intrinsic detector resolution but rather the camera resolution at the source depth for which the collimator is designed. The spatial resolution at depth for first generation clinical germanium cameras is anticipated to be from 1.7 mm to 4.6 mm."
 "The theoretical and experimental design of a proportional chamber gamma camera using the high-density drift space principle is outlined, for photon energies greater than 100 keV. Detection efficiencies of 50% or more are possible, using two converters, combined with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. Energy resolution is, however, poor. Experimental results of imaging are given."
"We have developed a self-contained instrument for the determination of bone mineral content by photon absorptometry. A high-resolution detection system allows measurements to be made at up to 16 photon energies. Control and arithmetic functions are performed by a microprocessor. Analysis capability and limitations are discussed."
"A solution to the problem of data acquisition and processing from multiple cameras via a signle computer is presented and discussed. Off-line disc systems or video tape peripherals provide greater speed of data collection, increase the total throughput of the camera-computer system, and provide backup in case of computer breakdown. They increase the efficiency of a single computer, thus minimizing the cost of data acquisition and analysis."
 "A preliminary design study has been conducted for constructing a 200 KeV scanning proton microprobe which utilizes the phenomenon of field ionization in hydrogen gas to create a proton source of extremely small dimensions and high \"brightness.\" Calculations for the focusing action of a non-uniformly graded accelerating column, in conjunction with a superconducting magnetic solenoid indicate a final beam-spot size better than 50 Å. The ultimate aim is to construct a high energy proton or heavy-ion microprobe which will rival or even excel the field emission scanning electron microscopes presently in use. Justification for using high energy protons (or heavy-ions) as probe particles instead of electrons has been presented in this paper, along with details of the beam transport and focusing system."
"A simple digital technique is described which enables quick recording and analysis of bio-signals. Standard nuclear data acquisition techniques have been suitably adapted for on-line and off-line recording of bio-signals. A 1024-channel analyser with 50 MHz analog-to-digital converter data acquisition system is used for on-line recording. The data obtained from the data acquisition system is processed for detailed feature selection first by eliminating the extraneous noise by programmed digital filtering technique, by which the signals between 0-25 Hz are retained 25-50 Hz are attenuated (transfer function varies from 1.0-0.0) and signals above 50 Hz are eliminated. The smoothened data are differentiated and stored. The results of two leads. I and II, as evaluated by this processing and as evaluated by a physician agreed well. The coefficient of correlation was 0.99, the slope of regression line was (0.9918 ± 0.03) and intercept for the same was (-0.0007 ± 0.0098). These results are presented and discussed."
"A dosimetric method based on the radiophotoluminescence (RPL) of single crystals and extruded pellets of LiF has been developed. Thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD) with LiF is currently used in clinical applications because of its tissue equivalency response and its physieal characteristics; e.g. small size, non-sensitivity to humidity, flexibility in geometrical form, etc. Disadvantages of TLD are: a) it saturates at a dose level beginning at several hundred R and b) the readout process is destructive. In many clinical applications a dosimeter is needed that can operate at higher doses. On the basis of the work of Regulla and Claffy et al. an RPL method using LiF was developed which can be used at higher doses and maintains tissue equivalency response."
"The design requirements for an in situ transuranic detector are defined based on the properties of the expected radiation fields. The need for such a detector, limitations of present methods, and reasons for these limitations are also discussed. Some possible new approaches (at least as applied to this problem) are indicated."
"This system for quantitative analysis of Pu in soil via 241Am has four 2.5-mm high-purity Ge detectors of 33 cm2 total detecting surface area. These detectors are paralleled by gating circuitry to avoid the degradation of energy resolution associated with electronic output summing. In field tests the system was approximately three times as sensitive as a 70-cm3 Ge(Li) detector and approximately an order of magnitude more sensitive than the FIDLER system."
"This paper describes an airborne plutonium monitoring system which is installed in the ZPR-9 (Zero Power Reactor No. 9) facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The design and operational experience are discussed. This monitoring system utilizes particle size and density discrimination, alpha particle energy discrimination, and a background-subtraction technique operating in cascade to separate airborne-plutonium activity from other, naturally occurring, airborne activity. Relatively high sensitivity and reliability are achieved."
"Changes of radon-222 content of well waters in seismically active regions may provide earthquake precursor signals, according to reports of recent Chinese and Russian work. A high-precision γ-ray system for continuous monitoring of radon in wells and Springs has been developed at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, where monitoring began in April 1975, and has been extended to other sites including the San Andreas fault zone."
"A 2 inch NaI(Tl) scintillator has been incorporated into a remote real time monitor for gamma ray background. The scintillator contains a small 241Am source which provides a high energy reference pulse for maintaining system gain. Gain is maintained automatically by a variable gain linear amplifier at the central station. The detector is connected to the central station by a single coaxial line which passes both the high voltage and the signal. Gamma ray pulses are processed in a modified Wilkinson analog to digital converter to provide an output count rate proportional to exposure rate (microR/hour). The system has been shown to be stable against temperature change, to be independent of gamma ray energy in the range 0.1 to 2.0 MeV, and to be useful in the range 1.0 to 10,000 microR/hour."
"The instrument described measures the shortlived 222Rn-daughter concentrations and the Working Level (WL) in sealed \"hot chambers\" located in uranium mines. Radiation-induced pulses from two separate sensors are transmitted through 500 ft. cables to a microprocessor, which processes the pulses and controls the operation of the system. A read-only memory stores a fixed program which is used to calculate the desired concentrations. The results are printed as pCi/l (Rn-daughter concentrations) and WL."
"A multisensor environmental radiation monitoring system utilizing pressurized ionization chambers is described. The system is capable of measuring incremental increases in gamma radiation exposure of the order of 1 mrad/year due to gaseous effluents from nuclear power plants. Continuous monitoring at a number of sites at or beyond the reactor boundary is performed automatically under control of a microprocessor-based central data acquisition facility. The exposure rate record from each sensor is reduced to a convenient form which can be used to easily determine the reactor plume contribution to the total exposure."
"The use of the inert radioactive gas Kr-85 for tracer studies, leak detection, etc., will become more widespread as the sensitivity of available detectors increases. A multiwire multiplane proportional counter system for beta detection has been developed with a measured minimum detectable concentration for a 3-minute count of 3 × 10-3 pCi cm-3 of Kr-85 in a semi-infinite cloud. Larger proportional counters operated for counting times of several hours can reduce this limit to below 1 × 10-4 pCi cm-3. These detectors should be useful in monitoring low levels of -the radioactive inert gases and of x-ray emitting nuclides."
"Environmental radiation measurements have been made and the results reported for the past 15 years. These measurements have included both the neutron and gamma contribution to the environment due to Laboratory operations. In order to determine these values an understanding of the natural environmental radiation must be known. The techniques for measuring environmental gamma radiation have been improved upon during this time and the latest instrumentation and interpretation methods commonly used at this laboratory are reported. Not only is the natural radiation dose rate important but the isotopes responsible need to be identified for a complete understanding of the observed radiation. The techniques for this determination are described."
"A portable 73cm3 closed-end coaxial Ge(Li) gamma-ray spectrometer was made and in-situ measurement of environmental gamma-rays has been carried out. The detector has 17.5% peak detection efficiency and 2.5keV FWHM energy resolution for 1333keV gamma-rays at a source-to-detector distance of 25cm. The peak counting rate per unit flux of 662keV gamma-rays was 3.62cps/photon/cm2sec and FWHM was 2.1keV. Peak counting rate dependence on incident direction of parallel beam of gamma-rays was measured to find correction factors for in-situ data analysis. From the in-situ measurements, the concentrations of U-238, Th-232, K-40, and Cs-137 in the soil and their contributions to the total exposure rate at the detector were induced. These results are compared with those of low level Ge(Li) spectrometer measurement of soil samples and with those of in-situ measurement using a 3\"×3\" NaI(Tl) detector spectrum-to-dose conversion operator method. Another Ge(Li) detector having a special lead shield was made to detect only gamma-rays from plumes."
"Counting sensitivity for stardardized Ge(Li) detectors has been determined for a large number of detector-sample geometries and counting conditions. It has been found that relatively simple systems can satisfy a majority of applications, thereby resulting in a favorable cost-effective approach to enviromental measurements. Recommendations are made for the improvement of significant counting parameters for speific applications, resulting in the maximum counting capability for a given detector system."
"A mini-computer based environmental sample analysis and data storage system has been developed. The system is used for analytical data acquisition, computation, storage of analytical results, and tabulation of selected or derived results for data analysis, interpretation and reporting. This paper discusses the structure, performance and applications of the system."
"A real-time data acquisition and monitoring system was developed for coastal oceanographic parameter measurements. This system continuously measures profiles of temperature, conductivity, current velocity and direction as a function of depth at a number of fixed off-shore locations. The data acquisition, monitoring and control system features make this system generally suitable for unattended area monitoring applications."
"This paper describes several significant events related to the startup and initial operation of Zion Generating Station. Among the events described are a diode installation that resulted in failure of one redundant Engineered Safeguard logic and a wiring reversal that negated one safeguards function. A series of electrolytic capacitor failures are presented and the NSSS vendor's proposed corrective action is supplied. Three major electrical failures are described; these include a reactor coolant pump motor and both main generators."
"Developing an effective instrument department is an important part of a safe and reliable nuclear power plant. Plant Edwin I. Hatch, the first nuclear generating station in the Georgia Power system, presented problems unique in the Company for establishment and operation of its instrument shop. The initial organization of the shop was based on the Company's fossil power plants with expected man power estimated from the previous nuclear startups of other utilities. The construction testing program was mainly performed by the Production Department requiring temporary technical services to meet the work loads prior to and during initial fuel loading of the reactor. The testing requirements listed in the Plant Technical Specifications had grown from those of earlier nuclear plants taking more personnel to operate the surveillance program. Engineering changes in the shop necessitated restructuring the organization with the most experienced technicians providing direct supervision. Implementation of a comprehensive testing program for the plant instrumentation required the use of a computer and an extensive training program to provide the efficiency needed to manage it. This paper presents the problems encountered during the development of the instrument department and the methods used to resolve them."
  "Safety Systems (Emergency Core Cooling and Reactor trip) circuits at Peach Bottom were provided with complete, overlapping zone, on-line testability. This was accomplished by adding to and greatly expanding the coverage of the manufacturer installed test plugs. The general philosophy is that with proper insertion of test plugs, full logic initiation can be tested including valve operation and pump starts. No jumpers or lifted leads are required and injection into the core is defeated during test. These provisions simplified the testing program for Technical Specification (Tech Spec) requirements and eased licensing considerations. Although applied to a BWR, the principles outlined are applicable to any system or plant using digital inputs."
  "This paper discusses the existing Federal Interagency Radiological Emergency Response Planning Program in Support of Fixed Nuclear Facilities. The program is designed to assist States and local governments in developing and improving their Radiological Emergency Response Plans that are supportive of nuclear facility emergency plans required by regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
"The draft recommendations of a Federal Interagency Task Force on Emergency Instrumentation on the establishment of emergency radiation detection and measurement systems operated offsite by State and local organizations to measure the direct exposure to an airborne release from an incident at a nuclear reactor are reviewed."
"A variety of aerial radiological monitoring systems are available to respond to a radiological accident or incident affecting large areas. These are operated by EG&G, Inc. for ERDA's Division of Operational Safety. A survey system can be airborne within approximately two hours after notification. Both airborne and terrestrial radioactivity can be measured and mapped. Special analysis procedures allow discrimination between radioactivity from most man-made radioelements and naturally occuring radioelements. A position accuracy of ±54 feet can be maintained over a large area survey. Detection sensitivity for gamma sources employing NaI detector arrays on board an airplane flying at 500 feet altitude is better than 2 μR/hr for surface planar contaminants and approximately 10 mCi for a point gamma source."
  "The question of the optimum location of multiple radiation sources for quasi-uniform irradiation of plane surfaces is addressed, and the problem is studied numerically for the case of a square plane target surface and plane arrays of equal spherically symmetric (4π) radiation sources. The technique presented is also applicable to non-planar source arrays and non-planar targets as well as to the case of sources whose radiation pattern is not spherically symmetric. The square target problem is solved numerically for the case where the desired target surface flux uniformity is 80%. The optimum source location coordinates and the resulting target flux patterns are presented for a number of source arrays. The scaling with the number of sources used and the distance between the source and target planes is also given. The results show that a significant reduction in the total source strength required to produce a given quasi-uniform target fluence can be achieved by using multiple sources. For example, for an 80% uniformity constraint, four properly placed sources, So, are found to give ~19 times the average flux from a single source of strength So. This represents a gain factor of ~4.76 due to better utilization of the available source strength. Calculations show that gains in excess of an order of magnitude can be achieved in this manner by using a large number of properly placed sources."
"A new counting method for a detection system using a fission chamber placed under high neutronflux is presented. This method is based on the fact that pile-up of pulses delivered by the fission chamber produces a linear relation on log-log scale between the neutron-flux and the threshold voltage of an amplitude discriminator, when a count-rate of output pulses of the discriminator is maintained at a constant value. The fact has been verified by a theoretical approach using a simple model. A counting system with a negative feedback loop has been constructed to carry out this constant count-rate amplitude discrimination. Experimental results obtained by utilizing a small fast reactor show that the system can cover a wide range of the reactor power."
"In an attempt to determine the threshold radiation damage in amorphous semiconductors, radiation tests were performed on amorphous semiconductor thin film materials and on threshold and memory devices. The influence of flash x-rays and neutron radiation upon the switching voltages, on- and off-state characteristics, dielectric response, optical transmission, absorption band edge and photoconductivity were measured prior to, during and following irradiation. These extensive tests showed the high radiation tolerance of amorphous semiconductor materials. Electrical and optical properties, other than photoconductivity, have a neutron radiation tolerance threshold above 1017 nvt in the steady state and 1014 nvt in short (50 μμsec to 16 msec) pulses. Photoconductivity increases by 1½ orders of magnitude at the level of 1014 nvt (short pulses of 50 μsec). Super flash x-rays up to 5000 rads (Si), 20 nsec, do not initiate switching in off-state samples which are voltage biased up to 90% of the threshold voltage. Both memory and threshold amorphous devices are capable of switching on and off during nuclear radiation transients at least as high as 2 × 1014 nvt in 50 μsec pulses."
"We derive the form of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the location of the scintillation point given the photomultiplier counts in an Anger Scintillation camera. This estimate is also Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) if the prior probability density on the scintillation point is uniform in the object plane. The form of the estimate suggests the possibility of an optical filtering implementation. We note that the ML estimate implies a solution that is remarkably similar to the \"optimum position arithmetic\" derived by Tanaka, et al."
"Typical low power Schottky integrated circuits were exposed to two standard radiation environments to obtain characteristic radiation response in comparison to standard TTL. The neytron levels were 1.9×1012 and 2.1×1013 neutron/cm2 (Californium-252 spectrum). The gamma dose rates were 7×109 to 3.8×1010 rads(Si/sec (100 nanosecond pulse width). Neutron response was minimal - ß degraded less than 10%, other parameters shifted less than 5%. Photocurrents were roughly 50 to 100% higher than the standard TTL. Results indicate that LS series IC's were at least as neutron hard as typical standard TTL devices but may fail at a factor of 2 to 10 times lower gamma dose rate."
"A new nuclear betavotaic battety is described. It uses a Schottky barrier in place of the more standard p-n junction diode, along with 147Pm metal film rather than Pm2O3 oxide as in the commercially available Betacel. Design details of the battery including measurement of absorption, conversion efficiency, thickness etc. as functions of & resistivity and other cell parameters are described. A prototype design is discussed and its performance assessed."

 "A review of the electron beam sources of highly-stripped ions, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research during 1967-75, is given. The effective experimental ionization cross sections of positive C, N. Ar, and Xe ions by electron impact are presented. Possible fields of application of electron beam ion sources are indicated."
"We describe three ion sources working in our laboratory that deliver multiply charged ion beams. All of them are E.C.R. ion sources and are characterized by the fact that the electrons are emitted by the plasma itself and are accelerated to the adequate energy through electron cyclotron resonance (E.C.R.). They can work without interruption during several months in a quasi-continuous regime. (Duty cycle: <.5). Their charge state distributions (C.S.D.) depend on the size and the characteristics of the plasma. For the smallest source the performances are comparable to those of P.I.G. sources. For the biggest source, the C.S.D. tend towards those obtained by EBIS-type sources. Experimental results and guiding ideas concerning these three ion sources are reviewed."
    "A brief description is given of the conceptual background and formalism of the various ab-initio and semi-ab-initio quantum computational techniques for calculating atomic and molecular electron affinities: Hartree-Fock-Roothaan SCF, configuration interaction (CI), multiconfiguration SCF (MC-SCF), Bethe-Goldstone, superposition of configurations (SOC), ab-initio effective core model potentials, Xα-MS, plus other less comnon methods. Illustrative and comparative examples of electron affinities calculated by these various methods are presented."
"A review is presented on charge exchange cross sections of heavy ions at energies primarily in the range below 100 keV. Particular emphasis is given to the cross sections for capture of one or more electrons in single encounters of multiply charged ions with atoms. The system of the noble gases as projectile ions and target atoms is studied in detail. Systematic trends are examined. Attention is given to the influence of metastable ions on the cross sections."
"Sputtering is dependent on a number of projectile and target parameters. It is shown that the dependence of the sputtering yield on projectile energy, angle of incidence and atomic number is well understood. Also, the dependence on the bulk properties of the target is described reasonably well by theory, while the dependence on the actual surface topography of the target is difficult to quantify. Positive-ion sources mainly depend on the number of atoms sputtered per incoming ion (sputtering yield), while also energy- and angular-distributions of the sputtered material are of primary importance for negative-ion sources. These distributions are reasonably well known and allow a direct calculation of the emittance of some negative-ion sources."
"The ion charge state distribution (CSD) in a multiply charged ion source- (MCIS-) plasma can be determined from the spectrum of resonance transitions of excited neutral and ionised plasma particles. The principle of this method, which for noble gas ions involves vacuum-ultraviolet spectroscopy, is described and first measurements for a DUOPLASMATRON-ion source operated with He and Ar are presented."
"In this short paper, we would like to summarize the results of several cross section calculations on systems that are of interest to ion source development. Since we are so restricted on the size of this paper and because the details of the calculations will be published elsewhere, the descriptions of the theoretical procedures used will be extremely limited. This paper will be divided into three sections; the first is concerned with a series of H + Cs reactions, the second discusses H(2s) + Ar, Kr, Xe cross sections, and the third pertains to some H+ + Mg calculations."
"Charge exchange between multicharged ions and background atomic and molecular gases represents one of the limitations to the attainment of high charge states in heavy ion sources, particularly containment sources. This work is an attempt to study systematically a particularly simple but in many respects representative class of such reactions, namely, charge transfer between atomic hydrogen and fully stripped heavy ions. Approximate cross sections for these processes in the low keV range of collision energies were obtained using a multistate Landau-Zener method. The energy and Z dependences of the cross sections are discussed."
"Basic parameters of the electron beam ion source (EBIS) are defined. The experimental results of the Orsay EBIS are described. We give also the design of a synchrotron source for production of fully-stripped heavy ion beams and polarized protons."
"CYCLONE is an isochronous cyclotron in operation in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium). It is equipped with a P. I. G. hot cathode heavy ion source and accelerates various ions up to energies of 110 MeV Q2/A with extracted beam intensities reaching 10 μA in the 4+ state. The source is described and some performance parameters are given. In order to reach higher charge states an injector cyclotron is projected which will allow a final energy of 27 MeV/nucleon up to neon decreasing to 6 MeV/nucleon for xenon. Extracted intensities vary between 5 × 1013 and 109 pps depending on particle and energy. Some design aspects are described which will allow the cost of the project to be quite low."
"A three-dimensional rf quadrupole field trap has been designed for generation of multiply-charged ions by successive electron impacts, and for studies of physical processes occurring during charge transfers. Optimum operating conditions have been derived from theoretical considerations, and preliminary experimental results are given. At the end, some limitations and prospects of the quadrupole trap as a tool for physical investigations are briefly discussed."
"Production of the high-Z charge states in helium, nitrogen, and argon has been measured in the INTEREM device at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The INTEREM device contains a hot electron (~500 keV) plasma trapped in a minimum B geometry. The device is of interest because its parameters, electron density and energy, and ion lifetime are consistent with those required for the production of highly charged ions. Ion charge and ion energy spectra were measured independently using an einzel lens type energy analyzer combined with a quadrupole mass filter. For helium, most of the ions were doubly charged under proper operating conditions. For nitrogen, we found the ion yield to be peaked at Q = 4, and under these conditions the yield at Q = 6 was down by a factor of about 20. Energy distribution curves for different charge states show interesting features, from which important information may be inferred about the plasma in INTEREM. Although discrepancies exist in the ion yields we conclude that an INTEREM-like device employing a minimum B geometry and electron cyclotron resonance heating may be expected to be a good high-Z ion source."
"The properties of an electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) plasma (3 cm microwaves up to 2.4 kW) have been investigated. A total of 80 μA noble gas ion current has been extracted from a 1 mm dia. hole so far. The charge state distributions show a maximum above the 1+ state, indicating that multiple impact ionization is a dominant process. X-ray spectra, sheath potential and microwave reflection were measured to gain some physical understanding of the discharge. The applicability of our device as an ion source is discussed."
"Laser-triggered discharges have been considered for some time both for electron[1] and ion[2] sources. It has been recently shown that conventionally triggered metal-vapor vacuum arcs[3] can sustain even higher ion currents. In this paper, we point out that laser initiation permits arc operation in a high-current regime, and with geometry attractive for heavy ion sources. We present preliminary data on laser-initiated vacuum arcs [4] using carbon, copper, and tungsten cathode electrodes. Discharge current pulses of over 104 amperes with durations of up to 1 msec were employed to yield fully ionized source plasmas of liters volume with ion densities greater than 1013 cm-3. Electrode erosion rates were in the range of 10-4gm/C (the same order as in vacuum arcs) corresponding to ion injection currents in the range of 103 amperes."
"This paper reports an investigation of a number of parameters affecting the performance of the SuperHILAC 2.5 MV Adam injector source. The description will emphasize anode sputtered materials, and will discuss in some detail calcium and gold ion production. Parameters varied include electrode geometry, support gas type and electrode bias, to optimize beam intensity and electrode consumption. A factor of three improvement with high n+ gold ions appears evident with a new displaced electrode geometry. The source is operated in cold mode, is pulsed and operates usually at less than 0.6 amperes average current. Under these conditions source life has been measured to be sixteen hours at 25% duty factor, when generating calcium ions, with neon support gas."
"The electron beam ion source (EBIS) at Texas A&M University has been constructed and is currently undergoing tests on the injection and transmission of the electron beam through the solenoid. Results of computer simulation of the electron beam are presented, as well as measurements of electron beam profiles using a pinhole beam analyzer."
"An EBIS with dc output has been built running in a time-of-flight mode of operation, e.g., the ions become highly charged during the time of flight in the electron beam from one end of the source to the other. Design principles to produce current densities above 103 A/cm2 have been applied in constructing the source, including a high power electron gun and magnetic compression of the accelerated beam. First tests on the ionization of Argon show that desorption requires attention at the electron collector. Cathode extraction of ions has proved to be quite satisfactory, promising great flexibility in producing ions from any element, gaseous or solid."
"The principle of an electron beam ion source in time-of-flight mode was verified in an experimental arrangement with low electron currents but high current densities due to an unusual cathode process. By varying only the applied axial electric field, maxima in the relative abundance of the charge state distributions up to 4+ for Ar and 5+ for Xe could be obtained. Relative abundances as well as absolute ion yields and their dependence on the different parameters can be explained by a theoretical model using a Monte Carlo program. Based on these investigations an extrapolation has been made for ion yields which may be obtained in a TOFEBIS with high electron current and current densities."
"An electron beam ion source for the production of multiply charged heavy ions has been developed. DC ion beams of neon, argon, krypton, and xenon ions have been produced. Xenon beam currents are in the range from some 10-9A for Xe10+ up to about 10-6A for charge states lower than Xe4+. The ion source proved to be very reliable and simple to operate. The analyzed charge spectra are compared with a theoretical model which allows for computation of the ion charge distribution in dependence on various source parameters."
"IPCR heavy ion linac is of a Wideröe type and its accelerating frequency is variable between 20 and 40 MHz. It is designed to accelerate ions with mass to charge ratios between 5 and 20 at these frequencies. Total voltage gain with six cavities is about 16 MV, the length of each cavity being three meters. Non-constancy of voltage between drift tube gaps against the change of a frequency gives large phase oscillations. Nevertheless, this results in very little effect on the transverse acceptance compared with that given by a constant distribution."
"A survey on questions related to the production of multiply charged ions with the hot cathode ion source is given. Some characteristics of the ion source with heated cathode are discussed. It is shown that the use of hydrogen as a ballast gas in the discharge gives some possibilities for increasing the intensity of beam of multiply charged ions. The perpendicular plasma pressure of the discharge column is measured and values of Te and n are estimated. From the axial distribution of the ion charge states, it is concluded that a potential well trapping ions should exist in the discharge column. It is shown that local inhomogenities of the magnetic field along the discharge column give rise to a substantial increase of the intensity of multiply charged ion beams."
"Two types of PIG sources suitable for generation of multiply charged metal ions are currently under investigation on the test bench: One is a Dubna type source equipped with a sputtering electrode similar to Tretyakov's design. The central part of the anode is run very hot to achieve effective re-evaporation of the sputtered material. Furthermore, source feed by use of ovens has been applied. The other source uses plasma-heated cathodes, and sputtering electrodes of cylindrical shape surrounding the plasma column almost entirely. For both source types, Ar is preferred as support gas; the content of metal ions in the total extracted current ranges from approx. 10 % up to 80 %, depending on source type and metal species. Among other ions, Ta10+, Au9+, Bi10+ and U11+ have been obtained."
"The duoplasmatron has been studied with particular emphasis on the production of multiply charged heavy ions. Experiences and results achieved in the past lead to the construction of a source permitting the application of higher discharge power and ion extraction from the point of densest plasma. With pulsed operation, discharge conditions were found where ions up to Xe11+ are extracted. Outlines of further development of a duoplasmatron type heavy ion source are sketched."
"Calorimetric measurements of the power dissipated at both the anode and the anticathode of a hot-cathode Penning ion source have been made. The analysis leads to the existence of a considerable electron flow from the PIG plasma onto the cathodes. That is in agreement with the electron currents extracted through holes in the cathodes of a hot-cathode PIG source. Neither the measured plasma electron temperature of < 15 eV nor the emission of electrons from the cathodes with velocities > 0 provide an explanation. Therefore, it is assumed that a fraction of primary electrons is heated by means of nonlinear collective plasma processes. A PIG discharge model involving a peculiar velocity distribution of the ionizing electrons is presented."
"The extraction of highly positive charged ions from a PIG source with axial geometry has been investigated by studying the discharge conditions for high discharge currents (up to 1 A) very high magnetic fields B ≈ 18 KT) and with additional electron injection from a duoplasmatron. Compared to an earlier version of the source, the total extracted beam current was somewhat improved, but the charge state distribution remained essentially the same."
"We have recently reported a technique for making metal ions for cyclotrons. Metal and non-metal ions from solids are produced in a Penning ion source by a process that involves ions that are unable to cross the first acceleration gap between the ion source and dee and are accelerated back into the ion source where they sputter charge material into the arc. This material is ionized and extracted from the ion source and accelerated. We have now used this technique for a large variety of ions, both metal and non-metal, including most recently aluminum from the metal and boron from boron nitride charge materials. We have also calculated the efficiency for making iron ions with different ion support gases and have experimentally checked these results. We are presently designing a dual ion source for our dc Penning ion source test stand which we believe will make an excellent source for producing ions from solids for dc extracted Penning ion sources."
"An ion source test facility has been constructed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for making fundamental measurements of the properties of Penning ion sources. The extracted ion energies from the source can be up to 36 × q (keV), where q is the ion charge. Both negative and multiply charged positive ions have been extracted from the source. The facility has high current capabilities for acceleration and for the arc power supply. These low-energy, multiply charged ions are currently being used for measurements of charge exchange cross sections, x-ray production, and electron impact excitation and ionization."
"The Bevatron 20 MeV duoplasmatron source is currently being modified with the goal of producing 1 mA of 20Ne3+. Initital tests at 420 KeV show a total beam of 20 mA of which 400 υA is 20Ne3+. The quantity of beam in various charge states is determined with a pulse field magnetic spectrometer. Titanium sublimation and cryogenic pumping of the PIG source in the High Voltage Terminal and its resultant effects on the acceleration of carbon and nitrogen will be discussed."
"The emittances of beams of Ar4+ to Ar8+ have been measured in the axial and radial planes. The extraction voltage was 10 kV and the magnetic field was varied from about .5 to .6 Tesla. The anode slit was varied in its distance from the arc which was run both dc and pulsed. The emittance was found to be nearly independent of charge state but to increase with total beam current. A small bowing of the arc column was discovered, which made evaluation of mirror field effects difficult."
"The emittance of positive ion beams extracted from a PIG ion source with end extraction was measured for optimal operating conditions of the source at different positions of the beam line. The source was operated with noble gases in a high voltage - low current discharge mode. The results showed that the emittances increase with increasing ion mass and intensity of the ion beam and furthermore under the influence of the space charge of the beam with the distance from the source. For ion beam intensities of 1 mA values of the emittance were obtained between 0,4 and 1,1 cm mrad MeV1/2 at a distance of 10 cm behind the extraction region. The brightness varied from 0,15 to 1,3 mA cm-2 mrad-2 MeV."
"A systematic study of the duopigatron has shown that this type of source is very convenient for the production of intense D. C. ion beams (> 10𝔪A) of heavy elements with moderate charge states, if the operation and design parameters are properly matched. The charge state density distribution compares with the best results reported for d. c. duoplasmatrons, whereas the discharge power is less or equal. For Argon, with a 0.8 kW power the percentage of particles in the beam is : A+ = 38, A2+ = 50.4, A3+ = 11, A4+ = 0.5, A5+ ≃ 0.1; the overall gas utilization factor being 80 % if an insulating material (BN) is used for the anticathode and expansion cup construction. The total beam intensity is determined by the diameter of the hole bored on the axis of the anticathode electrode and the ion current density in this plane is comparable to that at the anode plane of a duoplasmatron (≃ 2 A/cm2). The normalized emittance of the beam is EN = 4 × 10-7 m × rd for a total beam intensity of 7.8 mA which corresponds to an emissive hole of 0.8 mm diameter and a brightness of BN ≃ 1010 Axm-2xrd-2. Therefore, one possible advantage of the duopigatron in the near future is that very intense ion beams of heavy elements can be emitted because the anticathode collects more than 1 A argon ions (≃ 10% of discharge current) over an area of 1 cm2."
"The systematic study of the dependence of the charge state density distribution (CSDD) on the discharge parameters of both the duopigatron and the duoplasmatron sources has been conducted. The experimental data show that for both sources the optimum conditions for multiply-charged ion production correspond to the operation of the discharge at points between two different modes. In particular, the pressure must be matched to a minimum value (p=p*) corresponding to the arc starvation mode. Under this condition the discharge exhibits large level fluctuations which are correlated with enlarged ion energy spreads. However, the instability level can (particularly in the duopigatron) be minimized by a proper choice of the magnetic field shape and magnetic field strength (B=B*). In order to describe more completely the source performances, the emittance and brightness have been measured under optimum conditions for production of multiply-charged ions in our design. Solutions have been proposed to improve emittance and brightness by the adaptation of a plasma expansion cup. These solutions do not inversely affect the CSDD. The obtained performances are compared with other experiments."
"The experiments concerning the He++ formation with a duoplasmatron are presented. The measurements for choosing the suitable parameters of the source have been made with a test setup installed immediately after extraction electrode of the source. A method for estimation of the partial H2+ and He++ currents is proposed. The mass analysis has been made alternate for hydrogen and helium in the source and for a mixture of both in the expansion cup. With equal partial pressures of helium and hydrogen inside the plasma cup, the analyzed He+ peak does not change, the H+ peak increases by 30% and the (He++ + H2+) by 75%."
 "A brief account of cesium sputter ion sources is presented with particular emphasis being placed on sources that use a cesium beam as the sputter agent. Some thoughts are also presented on the mechanism whereby negative ions are formed by the sputtering of low work function surfaces. The possibility of increasing negative ion yields still further by the deposition of additional neutral cesium or some other alkali metal is discussed."
"The recently described ANIS source of the cesiumdoped, sputtering type has been the subject of further investigation. The range of beams obtained has been extended with beams of Li- (1 μA) and BO- (2.5 μA). The quality of the ion beam emitted from the source has been investigated in terms of emittance, brightness, and energy distribution."
"A sputter source is described in which the beam is extracted through the ionizer. This gives a very compact source with easily changed cones. The beam transmissions through an electrostatic accelerator are good and life times of in excess of a month between services are normal."
"A negative sputter-type ion source of the Mueller-Hortig geometry is described which utilizes a positive surface ionization source. Among the ion beams which have been produced are: A1-0.2 μA; A10--3 μA; Au--6 μA; C--25 μA; C2--20 μA; Cl--100 μA; Cu--0.5 μA; CuO--0.8 μA; F--40 μA; I--26 μA; 0--30 μA; Pt--3 μA; S--44 μA; TaO2--2 μA. The yields of Cl-, F-, O-, and S- produced from gaseous or high vapor pressure compounds are observed to be sensitively dependent on the metallic surface from which they are generated - indicating an intermediate surface chemical effect. While the source produces very intense beams of the halogens, sulfur, and oxygen and relatively intense beams of the metallic oxides, there appears to be a need for additional surface cesium to ensure maximum negative ion yields from many of the elemental materials."
"We describe recent measurements which give information about the formation of negative ion beams from the cathode material in SPIGS. We also report emittance measurements for SPIGS and the ANIS source of Andersen and Tykesson. In SPIGS the mechanism of negative ion formation from the cathode material is direct Cs-assisted sputtering of negative ions into the discharge followed by thermalization in the plasma before extraction. We find a correlation between the negative ion yield of SPIGS and the electron affinity (e.a) of the negative ion (the larger the e.a., the larger the yield). Correlation of sputtered negative ion output with electron affinity is also observed for ANIS and the Middleton and Adams surface ionization source. In SPIGS the low electron affinity negative ions are attenuated in the plasma more than the high electron affinity ions. Thus, SPIGS has lower output for the low e.a. ions than ANIS and the surface ionization source. Emittance measurements of the Cu- beam from SPIGS and ANIS indicate that both sources have two-dimensional emittance ~5 mm mrad MeV1/2 for 90% of the total beam. Thus ANIS has higher brightness than SPIGS for the low electron affinity negative ions."
"An early version of the developmental H- ion source for the Argonne Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) produced about 4 mA of negative ions in the mass range of 15-18 amu under conditions such that discharge cleaning of the source could not occur. The source was constructed almost entirely of carbonbearing, oxide-covered mild steel and stainless steel. The gas outflow was pulsed. At low arc and gas pulse rates, wall-plasma interactions produce volatile compounds such as CO, CH4, C2H6, H2O, etc. Ionization of these compounds and the fragments formed by their dissociation results in high levels of contaminants in the plasma and the positive ion beam emerging from the source; correspondingly high levels of contamination are obtained in the negative ion beam produced by charge exchange in H2 gas. The heavy ion contaminant fraction was reduced to about 2% of an 8-10 mA negative ion beam by running the source at 30 Hz with a continuous gas flow of ~ 0.25 Torr-l/s. It is possible to exploit the capability of the present H- source to produce large currents (~ 10 mA) of specific heavy negative ions."
"Equilibrium charge state distributions have been measured in many laboratories for both solids and gases with ions of a very large number of elements, and the range of ion velocities has been extended as new accellerators have become available. Many different charge changing cross sections contribute to any given equilibrium distribution so that direct measurement is preferable to computer predictions in cases where cross-section data are not known. Engineering difficulties due to short foil life under bombardment, especially at low energies, cause the choice of strippers in accelerators to be uncertain. Recent work on nonequilibrium charge distributions from small angle scattering in gas targets suggests that the intensity penalties incurred with gas stripping will be accept, able for a wide variety of applications. For large tandem accelerators, the use of gas strippers may depend upon the current-carrying capacity of the negative ion accelerator tube."
 "The angular dispersions and energy straggling of Ni, I and Au ions of energies between 0.4 and 0.9 MeV/ nucleon have been measured after bombardment of carbon foils in the range of 5 to 200 μg/cm2 in thickness. In these measurements the ions were detected in a Browne-Buechner spectrometer."
"A windowless gas target has been developed which uses gasdynamical focussing of a supersonic jet expanding into a region of static pressure of about 1 Torr. Target thicknesses between a few μg/cm2 and about 200 μg/cm2 can be achieved. Continuous density measurement can be made by means of electron scattering or light attenuation."
"Preliminary measurements of the charge equilibrium fraction F1∞ for the negative com ponent are presented for a He+ beam traversing a 2 μg/cm2 carbon foil. This fraction decreases with energy with a value of about 2.5 × 10-4 at 60 keV and about 1 × 10-4 at 250 keV."
"A source for polarized lithium ions is described which uses the atomic beam principle. The polarized atoms are surface ionized to positive ions on a hot oxidized tungsten ribbon and then converted to negative ions in potassium vapour. Measurements on source parameters are discussed. The method of ionizing a polarized atomic beam by a surface can be extended to the other alkalides and probably to some other ions. A method of producing a polarized halogen beam using surface ionization to negative ions is proposed."
"An automated system has been developed for measuring the emittance of beams from negative ion sources. The data are stored as two-dimensional spectra in a kicksorter and subsequently analysed with a PDP-10 computer. The system was first used to measure the properties of, and assess the value of design changes to, a Middleton sputter source. Subsequently, the emittance of several different types of negative ion source have been compared. A retarding field energy analyzer of high resolution has been used to measure the beam energy spreads from the Middleton sputter source and from other negative ion sources, including a direct extraction duoplasmatron and a sputter Penning source. Typical spectra have a width of a few eV, with a small group of higher energy ions."
"If we define a heavy-ion \"space\" bounded by the three axes of mass, energy, and intensity, it becomes clear that there are large parts of this space which are completely unexplored. This, by itself, is an attractive situation since unexpected phenomena will almost certainly be found. However, I believe that on the basis of what we already know about nuclei, atoms, and the solid state, there is ample justification to push the physics of these unexplored regions. The recent discovery that \"deep inelastic scattering\" is a principal reaction mechanism between two heavy nuclei was largely unexpected and this experiment will be briefly discussed. Several examples of interesting future measurements in nuclear and atomic physics with heavy-ions in the energy range of 100 MeV/AMU will be discussed."

 "This paper reviews the philosophy of environmental radiation monitoring programs in the environs of a nuclear power generating station as this philosophy relates to the utility. The goals of these programs as they relate to Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations are set forth. Program design for both preoperational and operational programs is presented. Finally, problems in the design and implementation of the various aspects of environmental monitoring programs are identified."
"Field spectrometry methods utilizing high resolution detectors can be used to quantify the concentration of radionuclides in soil, and the resulting external exposure rate. Advantages of the method compared to soil sampling followed by laboratory analysis are greater speed of analysis, integration of inhomogeneities of radionuclide areal distribution, and the immediate availability of data to guide further field studies. A disadvantage is that the calculation of results depends upon some knowledge or assumption about the distribution of radionuclides with depth in soil. The procedures necessary to calibrate and use a field spectrometer are discussed, and a practical guide is developed. Examples of uses of field spectrometry are the quantitation of complex mixtures of radionuclides in soil, the calculation of the resulting external gamma exposure rate apportioned by radionuclide, geochemical studies, preoperational and continuing studies at nuclear reactor sites, and the identification of short-lived, noble gas radionuclides in reactor plumes."
 "This paper reviews methods of environmental sampling for radionuclides around operational and preoperational nuclear power plants. We examine in detail the implications of the established radiation standards and their effect on sampling procedures. Transport mechanisms of radionuclides in liquid effluent, and the deposition of airborne radionuclides onto soil and vegetation are discussed. We evaluate water- and soil-sampling procedures. The Lawrence Livermore Laboratory program of terrestrial gamma-ray surveys at preoperational nuclear power plants is described."
"This paper reviews the current methods for laboratory analysis of environmental levels of radioactivity and discusses the background, Compton scatter, and efficiency parameters that are associated with the various spectrometer systems. The methods which are discussed are: 1) total absorption gamma-ray spectrometry, 2) multidimensional gamma-ray spectrometry, and 3) multidimensional gamma-ray spectrometry with dual beta coincidence (all systems use NaI(Tl) detectors). Dual Ge(Li) anticoincidence shielded systems as well as NaI(Tl) and Ge(Li) coincidence gamma-ray spectrometers are discussed. The analysis of X-ray and alpha emitters is pursued for both laboratory and field detector systems. The special adaptation of some gamma-ray, X-ray and alpha spectroscopy systems to field utilization including underwater analysis is presented."
"The application of thermoluminescence dosimetry to environmental monitoring, particularly in the vicinity of nuclear facilities, is discussed. The results of an intercomparison of TLDs and simultaneous TLD and ionization chamber measurements are presented. Techniques for interpreting measurements made in the environs of nuclear facilities are discussed and data are given demonstrating the application of these techniques for isolating exposures attributable to the operation of these facilities. The requirements of an ANSI Standard on environmental applications are summarized and the major features of commercial TLD systems discussed. Included is a short bibliography of general references, studies of the properties of phosphors and publications on the problems of environmental measurements."
"Recent advances in the methods of diagnostic cardiology have brought a change in emphasis toward noninvasive patient study. Nuclear Medicine techniques play an important part among noninvasive methods which enable diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation in the majority of patients with cardiac problems, without resorting to dangerous, painful and costly cardiac catheterization. Discussed are only a few of the myriad clinical applications which are rapidly making nuclear medicine techniques an integral part of the cardiologic diagnostic armamentarium."
"Nuclear medical diagnostic procedures for heart disease have received increased research attention over the last several years. At present these procedures must be considered as research procedures rather than as clinical procedures because the radioindicators available do not satisfy our criteria well enough to warrant their widespread distribution as radiopharmaceuticals. Of course, some are nearer to the ideal than are others. We will discuss various studies which have been done to determine 1) myocardial blood flow, 2) myocardial contractility, 3) extent of tissue damage from infarct and ischemia, and 4) cardiovascular thrombi. We will describe the radionuclides and radiolabeled compounds which are in current use, how they are made, and how well they perform as radiopharmaceuticals. Finally, we will discuss future radiopharmaceuticals for use in studying coronary heart disease and what hope there is, in our opinion, for the 800,000 people who die each year from heart disease."
 "With the development of the scintillation camera, it is now possible to record sequential radionuclide images from the precordium after injection of a high specific activity bolus of a radioactive intravascular indicator. From these images, the passage of the bolus can be visualized as it transits each of the cardiac chambers, the great vessels, and the lungs revealing both anatomic and functional characteristics of these elements of the central circulation. This qualitative technique can be used to diagnose a large number of congenital and acquired diseases of the heart and great vessels in a manner similar to contrast angiography. When a small computer is interfaced to a scintillation camera, time-activity curves can readily be generated from subregions of interest within the field of view of the detector. Quantitative analysis of these curves gives important and clinically useful functional information relative to the heart and circulation including cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and pulmonary blood volume. In addition, the size of intracardiac shunts can be quantified and certain wall-motion abnormalities can be detected and evaluated."
"An ECG-gated, scintigraphic imaging procedure is described in which a complete, average cardiac cycle is visualized with high temporal resolution. The ability of this method to detect wall motion abnormalities and quantitate left ventricular function is illustrated in a patient with severe coronary artery disease. These results are compared to (contrast) angiographic findings in the same patient."
 "The minimum prompt photoconductivity induced by pulses of x rays, gamma rays, and energetic electrons in various amorphous and disordered insulating organic and inorganic materials is predicted on the basis of data for the scattering of hot electrons in solids and the band gap for insulators. For total doses of 3 × 104 to 30 × 104 rad or greater, the minimum prompt photoconductivity is predicted to be linear with dose rate, γ, and is given by σ(γ-1cm-1)=5×10-19ρ0γ/Eg2, where ρ0 is the density (g/cm3) and Eg is the optical band gap (eV). This formula agrees well with data for a variety of plastics, mica, and borosilicate glass under widely different irradiation conditions. The formula considerably underestimates absolute values of prompt conductivities observed for Al2O3, MgO, and certain plastics, because the model does not hold for ordered materials."
"An inexpensive stand-alone CAMAC crate controller has been developed. The controller can be programmed to execute up to 256 instructions and CAMAC commands."
"A generalized analysis of zero cross-over timing systems is developed and applied to the case of germanium planar detectors to determine operating parameters which give smallest timing dispersion under the constraints of available charge-sensitive preamplifier risetimes. Charts are given using normalized values to indicate these parameters. The conclusions are verified by experimental results published elsewhere."
"This article describes a three-dimensional, finite-difference solution and program for self-consistent treatment of Maxwell's equations in air in the presence of an ionizing radiation pulse. The solution is based on polar coordinates, and gives the surface current density on a conducting body. Ionizing radiation generates primary Compton electrons, which in turn create secondary electrons and electromagnetic fields. Our solution yields these fields, and then self-consistently tracks the Compton-electron trajectories in the fields. It also determines the air conductivity due to the secondary-electron and air-ion densities, and correspondingly modifies the electromagnetic-field propagation. Finally, it keeps account of the air-ion and secondary-electron density changes due to generation by primary electrons, avalanche, and recombination. Numerical results are presented for the current on a vertical conducting post 2m high and 15cm in diameter when exposed to a 1 MeV γ pulse of 2×1012 rads/sec peak amplitude and 40 nsec FWHM. These results are presented for the ancle of γ incidence 10° and 45° from horizontal. For comparison, we show the way omission of self-consistency and/or γ-shadowing modifies the current."
"The pulse height distribution, obtained experimentally using a Ge(Li) detector, was employed to determine the photon emission rate characteristic of a PuO2 fuel source known as the SNAP 27 heat source. The selfshielding parameters of the photon emitter, the efficiency of the detector and the geometry of the experiment were utilized to determine the unscattered photon emission rate of the source and the unscattered flux spectrum at a certain specified distance from the source. For the scattered part of the flux spectrum a Monte Carlo technique was employed so that the total flux spectrum could be determined at any point in the radiation field. As a result of this work, a technique was developed to obtain the unfolded radiation spectrum of the SNAP 27 heat source."

   "What I hope I have demonstrated by these many examples is that an accelerator health physicist can make contributions in many fields of science. He can, in addition to the various operational tasks that he is charged with, support others in his laboratory. He can do this by designing shielding for new accelerators and storage rings, by consulting with experimenters on background radiation problems that they may encounter, by helping the high energy physicist select appropriate radiation sources for checking out his equipment, by providing him with low energy atomic and nuclear physics calculations, and many other ways. Most of all, he can perform and publish research using the many tools and techniques that are at his disposal at a high-energy accelerator laboratory. This he should do. I would like to end this lecture by quoting from a paper presented by Rindi at the Second International Conference on Accelerator Dosimetry and Experience that was held at Stanford University in 19698: \"The health physicist working around high-energy accelerators has the advantage over identical professionals working in more conventional centers of being associated with the most advanced techniques in many scientific fields, particularly those connected with particle detection. Many of the peculiar problems they are bound to solve require the use of some of these sophisticated new techniques. Moreover, it is my opinion that it is also one of their duties to provide a linkage between the physics and the correlated technical activities that they are involved in (or look upon)."
 "The Medical and Biophysical Sciences have often made use of technical developments in the Physical Sciences. High Energy Physics has made its contributions in recent years by bringing the use of scintillation and solid state detectors in trace element detection and in gamma imaging. More recently, the use of position sensitive detectors such as Multi-wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) has been introduced into Medical and Biophysical Research. In this paper we cover some of the applications of MWPC to problems in Medical Imaging of X-rays and γ rays, Neutron Radiography and X-ray Crystallography of complex organic molecules. The fact that these devices can be used to produce digitized information as well as analog image displays makes them very useful for 3-dimensional Reconstruction of Radioisotope Images. Details of the construction and associated electronics of MWPC are covered."
 "In this lecture we have attempted to draw comparisons between electron and proton shielding problems. The health physicist, charged with shielding either type of accelerator, must ask himself, \"Am I faced with a thick or thin shield problem?\" For the electron accelerator, he may be able to remove the photon component with medium or high Z materials close to the source, leaving a thick shield problem to solve. On the other hand, the health physicist at a proton accelerator always shields for hadrons; i. e., the photon component is always small. At both types of accelerators, muons may be a problem in the forward direction. If the shields are thick, then similar spectra should be observed to the degree that shield compositions are the same. Thus it is possible for health physicists at various accelerators around the world to use similar shielding codes and methods, and to compare measurements regardless of type of accelerator."
"The radiation environment to be found inside spacecraft, either in free space or earth-orbiting, is reviewed. The three main components of natural space radiation - galactic, solar, and trapped - are presented with a brief description of the important physical characteristics of each. The greatest known hazard to space travellers will come from rare large solar-particle events."
"First an outline of the principal methods of high energy physics to detect and to discriminate different particles within an unknown particle field is given. After that the instruments for Health Physics purposes are dealt with in some detail. Time-of-flight methods, spark chambers, Bonner spheres and activation detectors are reviewed with respect to particle energies of 1 to about 1000 MeV."
  "The United States' astronauts have been exposed to a complex radiation environment that poses unique problems in high-energy radiation dosimetry. Since the astronauts were exposed to natural radiation sources with a potential for delivering very large radiation exposures, exposure limits in excess of occupational limits were adopted. These limits represent a balancing of the risk from injury due to radiation exposure against other very high risks inherent in space flight and against the benefits to be derived from the space missions. The limits adopted for Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo/Soyuz are given along with the details of the radiation monitoring activities of the mission. The radiation exposures experienced in the United States' space missions are also given."
   "The use of computers in increasing the flexibility of a radiation protection system and in reducing the repetitive work load on technical staff is discussed in relationship to the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron.

 "After an explanation of the terms \"mixed field\" and \"conversion factor\" the determination of conversion factors in mixed fields is shortly reviewed. Finally several proposals for practical approaches are listed with their limitations."
"The biological effects of high-energy radiation are reviewed, with emphasis on the effects of the hadronic component. Proton and helium ion effects are similar to those of the more conventional and sparsely ionizing x- and γ-radiation. Heavy-ions are known to be more biologically effective, but the long term hazard from accumulated damage has yet to be assessed. Some evidence of widely varying but dramatically increased effectiveness of very high-energy (~70 GeV) hadron beams is reviewed. Finally, the importance of the neutron component in many situations around high-energy accelerators is pointed out."
"Microdosimetry provides detailed information on stochastic fluctuations of energy deposition in irradiated tissues. On the basis of these physical data one may draw basic conclusions regarding the biological action of radiations, particularly in the case of small values of the absorbed dose."
"The field of High Energy Accelerators has been changing rapidly during the last few years. In Proton machines future developments can be expected to involve superconducting magnet rings as well as storage rings to obtain higher CM energies. In Heavy Ion machines the trend is towards developing higher current medium energy machines with higher intensities than the present ones. In the region of medium energy physics (Proton machines Ep < 1 GeV) a number of circular and linear machines are commencing to operate whose main advantage over the old F.M. cyclotrons is primarily the higher intensity. In High Energy electron accelerators the main trend is at present to use the existing machines as injectors for electron-positron colliding rings, whose luminosity and energy are being increased to satisfy the needs of the Physics Research Programs. Some years in the future there are plans for Electron-Proton colliding rings (PEP) at energies around 70 GeV. In the lower energy range of electron machines there is considerable development of Medical accelerators underway as sources of Pions, Neutrons or X-rays, the last being the conventional use. The electron storage rings of the Physics machines are also in use as sources of synchrotron radiation, for physical and biological research in the far ultraviolet and soft X-ray region. The main developments in the next five years in accelerator construction are in the direction of using Superconducting magnets for circular machines and superconducting cavities for Linear accelerators."
 "The stochastic nature of the measurements used for image reconstruction from projections has largely been ignored in the past. If taken into account, the stochastic nature has been used to calculate the performance of algorithms which were developed independent of probabilistic considerations. This paper utilizes the knowledge of the probability density function of the measurements from the outset, and derives a reconstruction scheme which is optimal in the maximum likelihood sense. This algorithm is shown to yield an image which is unbiased -- that is, on the average it equals the object being reconstructed -- and which has the minimum variance of any estimator using the same measurements. As such, when operated in a stochastic environment, it will perform better than any current reconstruction technique, where the performance measures are the bias and viariance."

 "This paper presents a new algorithm for efficiently generating the minimal cut-sets of a fault tree containing repetitions of basic events. The algorithm is easily performed by hand and substantially reduces both execution time and storage requirements, over the classical technique, when programmed. The savings are accomplished by recognizing and recursively reducing the influence of the repetitive events. The theoretical basis of the algorithm is presented and examples from the recent literature, used to demonstrate its efficiency. Finally, the computational complexity is discussed and rules presented for simplifying the tree before the computations begin."
"Space charge profile and consequent field strength profile were obtained by solving the continuity and Poisson's simultaneous equations. Experimental electron deposition curve and radiation-induced conductivity curve were used for calculation. The calculated results explained well the observed replacement current and electrical breakdown phenomena. Dose rate, dose, and temperature effects on charge accumulation were also investigated."
"In fan beam computerized tomography, a crosschannel noise problem arises due to the scattering of photons from one path into another. This paper describes the effect of these scattered photons on the reconstructed image and gives an estimate of the quantities of scatter which are acceptable without serious degradation of the reconstruction."
"In this paper, the relative stability characteristics of nonlinear power reactor control systems are analyzed. The analyses are based upon the stability-equation method. A simple reactor control system with one complex nonlinearity is considered first, followed by a reactor control system with two nonlinearities not related by a linear transfer function with low-pass characteristic. The results of analyses are presented in parameter-planes with various loci and boundaries, which are useful for engineers to design a system by choosing the proper values of adjustable parameters."

  "The transient response, or flat-band voltage recovery, in a number of pedigreed SiO2 gate insulator MOS capacitors following exposure to a pulsed 13-MeV electron beam was studied as a function of time, temperature, and applied bias. A quantitative comparison of the response characteristics of the different oxides is made. It is found generally that the response consists of two stages. The first (early time) stage in most cases encompasses most of the recovery and is dominated by hole transport through the insulator film to the interface. This hole transport recovery stage in all the oxides studied is well described by the stochastic model of hopping transport based on a continuous time random walk used previously in the analysis of hole transport in SiO2. It is further shown that all the main features of the hole transport are consistent with a model of the holes moving via polaron hopping between localized sites in the SiO2. The second or long-term stage of recovery commences after cessation of the hole transport in the oxide and is found to vary significantly in its importance and time of onset among the various oxides. This stage involves a radiation-induced buildup of interface states and possibly, in some cases, an annealing of a trapped-hole distribution near the SiO2/Si interface."
"Studies of the temporal, temperature, and electricfield dependences of radiation-induced charge transport have been performed for radiation-hardened SiO2 films. At room temperature for high applied fields, nearly all electrons and holes generated in the oxide by a pulse of ionizing radiation (5-keV electrons) drift to the interfaces, whereas at low temperatures only electrons contribute to observed transport for relatively low fields. Below ~130°K at high fields, field-induced emission of trapped holes occurs, giving rise to collection within seconds of a significant fraction of the total number of holes generated. The present hole transport data are accounted for quite well in terms of a multiple-trapping model with a spread in trap levels ranging from ~0.3 to ~0.5 eV from the valence band. Comparison with the stochastic hopping transport model is made and that model is found to be less satisfactory in explaining these data. Charge buildup was examined in a Co60 environment and it is demonstrated that oxides exhibiting radiation tolerance at room temperature display severe radiation-induced changes at 77°K. It is also demonstrated that low-temperature charge buildup problems can be alleviated either by employing an ion-implanted oxide or by applying a relatively high field to the oxide during irradiation."
 "Avalanche injection and internal photo-emission techniques have been used to study the capture of electrons by positive charges introduced into the oxide layers of MOS capacitors. These two techniques have been used to study the positive charge in Al gate and poly-Si gate capacitors. The electron capture crosssection of this charge has been found to depend on the composition of the interface; positive charge at the Si interface tends to have a coulombic electron capture cross-section (~ 4×10-13cm2), while that at the alumninum interface has a non-coulombic electron capture crosssection (≤ 10-14cm2). The location of the positive charge induced by radiation under positive or negative bias has been determined in a completely non-destructive manner by photocurrent-voltage experiments. It has been found that under a positive irradiation bias, positive space charge accumulates within ~ 50 A of the Si-SiO2 interface, while under a negative bias, the space charge is within ~ 50 Å of the Al-SiO2 interface. In both cases there is evidence for some charge at the other interface introduced by the irradiation."
 "The model considers charge buildup in MOS structures due to hole trapping in the oxide and the creation of sheet charge at the silicon interface. The contribution of hole trapping causes the flatband voltage to increase with thickness in a manner in which square and cube dependences are limiting cases. Experimental measurements on samples covering a 200 - 1000 Å range of oxide thickness are consistent with the model, using independently obtained values of hole-trapping parameters. An important finding of our experimental results is that a negative interface charge contribution due to surface states created during irradiation compensates most of the positive charge in the oxide at flatband. The tendency of the surface states to \"track\" the positive charge buildup in the oxide, for all thicknesses, applies both in creation during irradiation and in annihilation during annealing. An explanation is proposed based on the common defect origin of hole traps and potential surface states."
"The ion implantations of many ions into single crystal epitaxial films of Pb0.8Sn0.2Te have been evaluated. Because of the wide spectrum of results, only those of the two most promising ions, S+ and In+, are presented. The S+ ions produced a p-type layer in Pb0.8Sn0.2Te. After a suitable post implant anneal In+ ions produced an n-type layer in p-type Pb0.8 Sn0.2Te. The In+ implants were used to produce detector arrays, while the S+ implants produced complete conversion of 4500 Å films."
"Measurements are reported in which the induced carrier concentration and Hall mobility of p-channel MOS structures are determined as a function of surface potential by Hall effect measurements at two different temperatures. The ratio of the Hall mobility to conductivity mobility was also determined. The density of interface states within 6 kT of the valence band edge was calculated. The density of these states generally decreased with ionizing radiation dose and the channel carrier mobility was found to decrease with irradiation at low surface potentials. At high surface potentials, channel carrier mobility was relatively insensitive to ionizing radiation. Carrier scattering mechanisms within the conducting channel are discussed."
"A theoretical model is proposed for the radiation-induced memory loss effect in thin-oxide MNOS memory devices. The model treats the stored charge as being located in the nitride, at an average distance from the silicon much larger than the oxide thickness. Under these conditions the radiation-induced conductivity in the nitride determines the decay of stored charge. It is proposed that the radiation-induced conductivity in the nitride is due to radiation-induced carriers drifting in the electric field during the slowing down process, and that the carriers become trapped before reaching thermal equilibrium. In calculating the radiation-induced nitride conductivity, a continuous slowing-down process is assumed. In addition, it is assumed that the radiation-induced carriers are generated according to a 1/(Energy) law. Although values for some of the parameters in the model are not known, it is shown that experimental values of the radiation-induced memory loss rate are consistent with physically reasonable values of the unknown parameters."
 "The randomly located trivalent silicon atoms are shown to account for the thermally generated interface states at the SiO₂-Si interface. The interface state density is greatly reduced in water containing ambients at low temperatures (450°C) by forming trivalent silicon hydroxide bonds. Interface states are regenerated when the ≡Si-OH bonds are broken by ionizing radiation and the OH ions are drifted away. In the bulk of the oxide film, the trivalent silicon and the interstitial oxygen donor centers are shown to be responsible for the heat and radiation generated positive space charge build-up (oxide charge) in thermally grown silicon oxide."
"The effects of oxidation time (or oxide thickness) on the hardness of 1000°C dry oxides on silicon is shown to result in a post-irradiation flatband voltage shift (ΔVFB) that is proportional to oxide thickness squared (dox2) for high energy irradiation and ΔVFB #x0221D; dox for vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation and negative corona charging. This is in disagreement with previously reported work in which ΔVFB #x0221D; dox3 was measured for high energy irradiation. The present experiments strongly suggest that hole traps are located mainly at the Si-SiO2 interface and have a total area density that is independent of oxidation time or oxide thickness at a constant oxidation temperature. Trace amounts of water were added to the oxidation ambient of a modified hard-oxide furnace tube in levels ranging from 16 parts per million (ppm) to 50,000 ppm. The results of these experiments show that trace levels of water do not significantly degrade the radiation hardness of dry oxides."
"The relationships of the electrical properties of irradiated MOS structures to processed-induced surface defects have been investigated. It has been found that the radiation-induced perturbations in oxide space-charge and interface states relate directly to the density of oxidation-induced stacking faults and edge dislocations. The density of such surface defects depends on both the structural properties of the starting silicon and the fabrication procedures. Oxidation-induced stacking faults are strongly related to the oxidation conditions, such as temperature, time, and ambiance. High-frequency CV, quasi-static CV, and ac conductance techniques were used to determine the interface state densities and flat-band voltage distributions. It has been found that, in addition to interface states, exposure to ionizing radiation causes gross non-uniformities in trapped positive space-charge. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on an MOS sample possessing a high density of stacking faults, it has been shown that positive charge-species drift to the SiO2/Si interface and form clusters in a random fashion similar to that of the defects delineated by differential etching. Based on the known relationship of surface generation lifetime on surface defects pre-irradiation lifetime has been demonstrated as an effective electrical parameter for the prediction of the total-dose radiation sensitivity of MOS devices."
 "Measurements are reported in which photodepopulation and thermal bleaching techniques have been applied to the study of radiation induced trapped positive charge in the Al2O3 substrate of n-channel MOS/SOS devices. Photodepopulation data indicates an optical depth for the hole traps of 2.5 eV. Thermal bleaching studies yield a corresponding thermal depth of 0.75 eV. Some preliminary thermally stimulated current measurements which reveal additional low temperature stable traps are also reported."
"The total ionizing radiation induced charge trapping effects at the silicon-sapphire interface of SOS (silicon on sapphire) devices have been characterized as a function of type of starting sapphire, sapphire polish, pre-epi annealing, and epitaxial silicon growth condition. The starting sapphire wafers were derived from the three basic growth methods which are Czochralski, ribbon (or edge defined), and gradient furnace (Schmidt-Viechnicki). The sapphire wafers were polished by different sources, and both hydrogen and air pre-epi annealing environments were used. The epitaxial silicon was grown using the standard uniform growth rate method and the \"burst\" method. The magnitude of the radiation induced charge trapping at the silicon-sapphire interface is correlated with the various processing variables and related to the back channel leakage currents of n-channel enhancement mode MISFET's. The amount of trapped charge is dependent on the bias applied during radiation and is non-uniform under the channel region of the FET devices."
"Some of the relationships between defects and impurities in SOS starting materials and the radiation hardness of CMOS/SOS devices have been investigated. It is shown that a direct correlation exists between contaminants in the epitaxial silicon film and the radiation-induced back-channel leakage currents. Radiation-induced shifts in device threshold voltage were observed, but these shifts appeared to be more closely related to variations in device processing than to silicon film contamination."
"It is well known that processing steps strongly affect the radiation tolerance of MOS oxides. In this paper we present the effects of post oxidation anneal on the radiation hardness of steam grown oxides. Radiation hardness varies systematically with anneal time and temperature and can be controlled over a more than order of magnitude range. For each anneal temperature there is an optimum anneal time which gives the best radiation hardness. Extending the anneal time beyond the optimum tends to degrade the hardness with the square root of time. A model involving the diffusion of excess silicon into the oxide is proposed to explain the hardness degradation for extended anneals. Additional data presented show a square law dependence of radiation induced flatband shifts on oxide thickness, and the effects of low temperature hydrogen treatments and aluminum sinter steps on radiation performance."
"The primary failure mechanism of CMOS devices in an ionizing radiation environment is a threshold voltage shift in both the p-channel and the n-channel devices due to a buildup of radiation-induced fixed charge in the silicon dioxide and the creation of surface states at the silicon-silicon dioxide interface. It has been observed that many CMOS device types exhibit milliampere range post-rad n-channel leakage for doses between 104 - 105 rad (Si) even though the gate oxide threshold shift is much less than that required for inversion in the channel region. This is caused by field oxide inversion under the gate metal due to improper or a lack of guardbanding of the n-channel device for a radiation environment. The solution to this problem in hardening CMOS devices involves guardbanding the n-channel devices and extending the gate oxide under the gate metallization over the guardband. Experimental results on devices which utilize this technique has shown it to be an effective solution to the problem. Data on several types of CMOS devices are presented to illustrate the n-channel leakage problem and the solution. Special guardbanding problems encountered with silicon gate on bulk Silicon devices are also described and possible solutions to these problems are discussed."
"This paper reports the results of extending previously reported radiation hardening methods to a self-aligned CMOS/SOS process. Over 20 lots of CMOS/SOS circuits have been fabricated with this process. Threshold shifts, after 1 Mrad (Si) Co60 irradiation are ≤ 1.2V for the n-channel devices and ≤ 2.7V for the p-channel devices under worst case bias conditions. Several lots of devices have been fabricated with μ 0.7V n-channel shifts and ≤ 1.2V p-channel shifts under the above radiation and bias conditions. Post-irradiation n-channel back leakage is in the range of .05 to 5 μA per mil of channel width, the specific value dependent to a considerable extent on quality of the starting SOS material. Electrical parameters and life-test stability are excellent and equal to those obtained with similar, non-radiation-hard processes."
"The recently developed technology for building radiation-hardened CMOS/SOS devices has now been applied to the fabrication of LSI circuits. This paper describes and presents results on three different circuits: an 8-bit adder/subtractor (Al gate), a 256-bit shift register (Si gate), and a polycode generator (Al gate). The 256-bit shift register shows very little degradation after 1X106 rads (Si), with an increase from l.9V to 2.9V in minimum operating voltage, a decrease of about 20% in maximum frequency, and little or no change in quiescent current. The p-channel thresholds increase from -0.9V to -1.3V, while the n-channel thresholds decrease from +1.05V to +0.23V, and the n-channel leakage remains below lnA/mil. Excellent hardening results were also obtained on the polycode generator circuit. Ten circuits were irradiated to 1X106 rads (Si), and all continued to function well, with an increase in minimum power supply voltage from 2.85V to 5.85V and an increase in quiescent current by a factor of about 2. Similar hardening results were obtained on the 8-bit adder, with the minimum power supply voltage increasing from 2.2V to 4.6V and the add time increasing from 270 to 350 nsec after 1X106 rads (Si). These results show that large CMOS/SOS circuits can be hardened to above 1X106 rads (Si) with either the Si gate or Al gate technology. The paper also discusses the relative advantages of the Si gate versus the Al gate technology."
"This paper presents the results obtained from total dose and transient radiation tests on a CMOS/SOS/Al-Gate D/A converter and on-chip diagnostic transistors. Samples were irradiated by Cobalt-60 gamma rays under worst-case conditions, and by 10-MeV electron pulses of 50-ns and 4.4-ps duration. Devices were fabricated with three different insulators; the two discussed here are standard wet oxide and a pyrogenic oxide. Test transistors on the D/A chips made it possible to diagnose the failure modes of the converter and to evaluate some special designs. These consisted of standard edge p- and n-channel transistors, edgeless units, edgeless tetrode transistors, and an edgeless type transmission gate with a diode clamp from substrate to gate. The total dose results indicate that the pyrogenic oxide increased the failure dose of the operational amplifier portion of the converter from 103 rads (Si) to 2×l06 rads (Si); however, the sample and hold failed after exposure to a low level of 103 rads (Si). Test devices indicated this to be due to the radiation-induced leakage current of the transmission gate which discharges the sample and hold capacitor. The diode clamp decreased the threshold voltage shifts and the leakage currents. The edgeless devices improved the device performance because of a more abrupt turn-on. Narrow-pulse test data indicated that the edgeless units produced less photocurrent than the edge units by about a factor of three to four. Converter upset levels are <109 rads/s due to precision requirements which make a few millivolt transients untenable."
"The radiation induced damage and the subsequent short term annealing in CMOS/SOS devices have been experimentally investigated. Transient threshold voltage shifts were measured after exposure to prompt ionization pulses. The measurements concentrated on early annealing, within 100 microseconds after the ionization pulse. Longer term annealing, up to 100 seconds after the ionization, was also characterized. The effects of prompt dose-rate, temperature, gate oxide thickness, and the electric field in the gate oxide during the ionization and during the annealing period were examined. The data demonstrate that the threshold shift is independent of dose-rate for prompt (less than 30 nanosecond) ionization. The annealing rate is shown to be a strong function of temperature with no annealing occurring at -195°C and an enhanced annealing rate at +125°C. The data demonstrate that, at room temperature and for zero field in the gate oxide, there is no significant annealing occurring before one microsecond after a prompt pulse. Threshold shift is shown to be proportional to the square of the gate oxide thickness. Threshold shift and annealing rate are shown to be dependent on the magnitude and polarity of the field in the gate oxide. The bias dependence results for p-channel transistors are consistent with those predicted by a stochastic thermal charge-hopping transport model."
"Today's precision oscillators and clocks are discussed. They include cesium standards, rubidium standards, hydrogen masers, and quartz crystal oscillators. A brief review of their basic design philosophy and performance characteristics is given. Block diagrams of schematics of the physics packages as well as of the electronic systems are given, and it is pointed out quantitatively (where possible) which parameter changes cause frequency shifts and/or performance deterioration. Particular attention is focused on those parameters which are likely to change under nuclear radiation."
"The response of Charge Coupled Device (CCD) linear shift registers to transient ionizing radiation has been evaluated. Dose rates from 6×104 to 1×107 rads (Si)/sec were used to deliver between .06 and 20 rads per pulse. The measurement techniques used and the response of the CCD register to these exposures is described. The recovery of the CCD to normal operation and the dependence on dose, dose rate and clock frequency is discussed with particular emphasis on the time dependence and mechanism of the device recovery. The practical limitations on CCD applications in an ionizing radiation environment are discussed."
"A process for total dose hardening of surface p-channel CCD's with overlapping polysilicon gates has been developed by optimizing the process steps associated with the gate oxides and polysilicon gates. 16-bit shift registers fabricated with this process can be operated up to 1×106 rads (Si) with threshold voltage shifts of ≤ 2V for the buried gates, and ≤ 1.5V for the surface gates on the best devices fabricated. The charge transfer efficiency for the devices with -10V gate bias during irradiation is unchanged after 1×106 rads (Si), but drops to 0.999 for the devices with OV gate bias during irradiation. The average dark current increases to only 1.75 times the initial value after 1×106 rads (Si) for devices with -10V gate bias during irradiation, and to 4 times the initial value for the devices with OV gate bias. No additional dark current spikes are observed up to 1×106 rads (Si). These results represent a very large improvement in hardness over typical CCD's."
"The total dose effects of gamma radiation on an unhardened 244 line by 188 element charge injection device (CID) imager have been investigated. Key device parameters were monitored and the primary failure mechanisms identified. The operating parameters which are compatible with the largest possible total dose tolerance were determined."
"Results are reported of an experimental study of the effects of neutron radiation on five different types of surface acoustic wave (SAW) convolver. A general model for the operation of a SAW convolver is described, and the varying effects of the neutron radiation on the five convolver types are explained in terms of this model. The diode-tapped delay line was found to be the most radiation-hard SAW convolver."
"Techniques for producing radiation hardening in GaAs light emitters by use of donor dopants and isovalent anion substitutional alloying are reported. Six different donor dopants, within the concentration range from 1 to 20 x 1017 cm-3, were added to GaAs substrates. P-N light emitters were then fabricated and exposed to gamma irradiation from a 60Co source in steps to a total absorbed dose of 108 rads(Si). Results of the study are reported in terms of the damage parameter Kγ το where Kγ is the damage coefficient and το is the preirradiated minority carrier lifetime. Selenium (Se) was the most effective dopant for hardening GaAs light emitters followed in order of decreasing effectiveness by Sn, Si (donor), Te, Ge (amphoteric), and Si (amphoteric). Two additional observations in this portion of the investigation also seemed to favor the use of Se for hardening: (1) The recovery of the emitters following isochronal annealing occurs in the sequence Se, Sn, Si, Te, and Ge, with the Se-doped samples showing the greatest annealing (to 60% of original quantum efficiency). (2) The shift of the peak emitting wavelength with irradiation (always toward shorter wavelengths) is found to be least for the Se-doped samples. The second technique for hardening involved substituting the isovalent anion phosphorus (P) into the GaAs lattice in place of As. This action resulted in a lowering of the damage coefficient, Kτ , by several orders of magnitude as the P content increased to about 50%."
 "The electrical characteristics of guarded Au- and Al-n GaAs Schottky diodes with free carrier concentration in the range of 3 x 1015 to 8 x 1016 cm -3 have been determined after neutron irradiation. Low neutron fluences producing carrier removal rates less than 20% cause a slight change in the C-V and the forward I-V characteristics but increase significantly the reverse current. Assuming Levine's model for a Schottky barrier, the slight changes in the I-V characteristics at forward bias and small reverse bias voltage have been attributed to a change in the distribution of interface states at the metal-semiconductor interface. The excess, non-thermionic reverse current observed after low fluence neutron irradiation is not due to surface leakage or classical generation-recombination but appears to be due to a high field process. Consideration of several high field effect mechanisms indicates that field emission from a deep level is the likely cause."
"A versatile computer program that includes the basic electronic and thermal processes important in second breakdown is described. Calculations of static and dynamic voltage-current characteristics showed that with increasing current density, regions of single-avalanthe, space-charge-limited, double-avalanche, and negative-differential-resistance current flow can be identified. Analytic expressions for the static characteristic in the three positive resistance regions are presented for several diodes at a few temperatures. Second breakdown voltages of more than double the first breakdown voltage have been computed."
"Aftereffects in IMPATT oscillators under transient ionizing radiation were evaluated using half watt Si and GaAs X-band IMPATT diodes in a resonant cap waveguide cavity. During the radiation testing, the RF impedance was varied by changing the length of a sliding short behind the diode and the bias impedance was varied independently by inserting lengths of coaxial cable between a fixed R-C bias network and the diode. From the experimental. results we conclude that: 1. the aftereffects are clearly related to a device-circuit interaction, which occurs in the resonant cap waveguide circuit only if the sliding short is one guide wavelength, rather than one-half guide wavelength, from the resonant cap diode structure; 2. the principal cause of the aftereffects is not improper bias circuit impedance resulting in bias circuit oscillations, although bias circuit oscillations can cause diode failure if they are allowed to occur; and 3. the GaAs Schottky diode is more prone to the aftereffects, occurring at power levels above 200 mW and dose rates above 2 x 109 rads/sec for the diode tested. The aftereffects appear to be triggered by a looping RF circuit impedance locus combined with the change in large signal IMPATT impedance with enhanced leakage current."
"This paper presents the results of an investigation of quantitative procedures for assessing the probability of failure (PF) of tactical military systems exposed to a neutron radiation environment. All assessments are made with a 90 percent confidence in the determined probability of failure. Two analytical models are developed for predicting the probability of failure of transistor circuits based on small quantity test data or manufacturer's specifications of gain (6) and gain bandwidth product (fT) . The formulation of these models incorporates the influence of circuit design margins. For circuits where the failure fluence is determined by a single device, a nomograph is presented for calculating PF as a function of fT, initial gain, fluence, and the circuit design margin. Examples are also provided for the use of the models for determining PF via Monte Carlo analyses for circuits including several transistors."
"This paper reports on an Integrated Injection Logic (I2L) radiation effects model which includes radiation effects phenomena. Twenty-five individual current components were identified for an 12L logic gate by assuming wholly vertical or wholly horizontal current flow. Equations were developed for each component in terms of basic parameters such as doping profiles, distances, and diffusion lengths, and set up on a computer for specific logic cell configurations. For neutron damage, the model shows excellent agreement with experimental data. Reactor test results on GE I2L samples showed a neutron hardness level in the range of 6 x 1012 to 3 x 1013 n/cm2 (1 MeV Eq), and Cobalt-60 tests showed a total dose hardness of 6 x 104 to greater than 1 x 106 Rads(Si) (all device types at an injection current of 50 microamps per gate). It was found that significant hardness improvements could be achieved by: a) diffusion profile variation, b) utilizing a tight N+ collar around the cell, and c) locating the collector close to the injector. Flash X-ray tests showed a transient logic upset threshold of 1 x 109 Rads(Si)/sec for a 28 ns pulse, and a survival level greater than 2 x 1012 Rads(Si)/sec."
"A technique is presented which demonstrates the feasibility of selecting junction-isolated integrated circuits (JI/ICS) for use in transient radiation environments. The procedure guarantees that all PNPN paths within the integrated circuit are identified and describes the methods used to determine whether the paths represent latchup susceptible structures. Two examples of the latchup analysis are given involving an SSI and an LSI bipolar junction-isolated integrated circuit."
 "A new multiport silicon-gate, CMOS/SOS standard cell family that achieves transient upset and total dose hardness has been designed and evaluated. This radiation hardness was achieved by design and process procedures normally not considered in conventional CMOS/SOS circuits. To evaluate the cell family a test chip and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) integrated circuits were fabricated. The cell-family performance was characterized utilizing 60ns to lμs electron pulses from the LINAC and total dose gamma irradiation from the cobalt-60 source. The results show circuit upset at levels greater than 1011 rad (Si)/s for short (60ns) irradiation pulses. Total dose irradiations to 106 rad (Si) indicate a 20 percent reduction in circuit speed and a factor of 10 increase in chip leakage. Utilizing these standard cell building blocks, radiation hard, quick-turnaround, low-cost custom LSI arrays can be fabricated using design automation techniques."
"This paper presents the results of transient radiation tests on a Carry-Look-Ahead Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), the computer simulation of the transient response of this ALU device, and a proposed transient radiation-hardened design for a Read Only Memory (ROM). Experimental results demonstrate the validity of simple SOS device predictions of failure levels for the more complex ALU devices. ALU samples were fabricated with four types of insulators; namely: Al2O3, ion-implanted SiO2, dry SiO2, and wet SiO2. These devices were specially made to investigate total dose hardness and to check the transient hardness of the fabrication on a sapphire substrate. Circuit design and sizing rules to achieve transient hardness were not utilized. Devices were exposed to 10-MeV electron pulses of 20 and 100 ns in a static and an active mode, with inputs activated by six basic test patterns. Upset failure did not occur in the 20-ns pulse tests for all exposure conditions and dose rates up to and including the maximum rate of 1.3 × 1010 rads (Si)/s. The 100-ns pulse tests indicate that the failure level is 3.5 × 1010 rads (Si)/s, whereas the pass level is 2 × 1010 rads (Si)/s. The worst-case exposure conditions are the static mode of operation with the chip outputs in a high state. In order to explain the test results, a simple circuit model of a limited part of the chip output circuit was derived for the static mode of operation and output high."
"Radiation hardening procedures have been implemented in design, analysis and fabrication of a 64-bit CMOS/SOS RAM. The resultant circuit is a moderately complex (714 transistor), dielectrically isolated integrated circuit which features high performance and high radiation tolerance. Typical electrical parameters include 120 nsec read-access time and 1μwatt/bit standby power dissipation. The SOS construction minimizes radiation-induced transient photocurrents while a hardened gate insulator provides immunity to total dose effects. Transient radiation upset levels exceed 3 × 1010 rads(Si)/sec for short (≤ 50 ns) pulses and ionizing dose hardness exceeds 106 rads(Si). A neutron fluence of 3.65 × 1014 n/cm2 had no effect on circuit operation beyond that expected from the ionizing radiation alone."
"The 4K NMOS dynamic RAM is one of the least radiation tolerant of modern semiconductor devices. Samples from seven manufacturers exhibit a uniformly high susceptibility to total dose with the failure threshold starting at 1700 rads (Si) and the parts completely dead by 3500 rads (Si). The entire circuit is dynamic including the peripheral circuitry with the sense amps detecting 200 millivolt signals. In the tested population, most failed for VGT shifts. The design will tolerate <0.2 volt change. Test transistors on the die were measured confirming this conclusion. Circuit analysis and electrical autopsy indicate the X and Y decoders are stuck in \"1\" state causing failure. Most 4K NMOS devices are processed for optimization of electrical performance, commercial reliability and yield. These processes utilize chlorine oxides for stability, ≥ 1000 Å thick gate oxides for static discharge reliability, and silicon gate techniques for threshold and speed requirements. Changes in any of these processes affect at least one of the \"optimized\" performance criteria adversely so that the devices no longer meet commercial price/performance requirements. Increased complexity NMOS devices, such as 16K RAM's and microprocessors, utilize extensions of the existing NMOS technology and will also be very susceptible to ionizing radiation."
"The applicability of commercially available microprocessors to certain systems requiring radiation survival was assessed. A microcontroller was designed and built to perform a monitor and control function of military operational ground equipment, and demonstrated to exceed the radiation hardness goal. The preparation of the microcontroller module required hardware and software design, selection of LSI and other piece part types, development of piece part and module electrical and radiation test techniques, and the performance of radiation tests on the LSI piece parts and the completed module. The microcontroller has a 16-bit central processor unit, a 4096 word read only memory, and a 256 word read-write memory. The module has circumvention circuitry, including a PIN diode radiation detector. The processor device used was the MMI 6701 T2L Schottky bipolar 4-bit slice. Electrical exerciser circuits were developed for in-situ electrical testing of microprocessors and memories during irradiation. A test program was developed for a Terradyne J283 microcircuit tester for more complete electrical characterization of the MMI 6701 microprocessor. A simple self-test algorithm was used in the microcontroller for performance testing during irradiation. For the operational demonstration of the microcontroller a TI 960A minicomputer was used to provide the required complex inputs to the module and verify the module outputs. Radiation test data was acquired on several LSI device types, including T2L, I2L, and NMOS technologies. Dose rate tests were performed on the module and proper circumvention and recovery obtained up to and including the maximum test level of 108 rad(Si)/sec."
"This paper explores the feasibility of introducing saturable magnetic cores into the circuit topology of a basic R-S latch to simultaneously decrease sensitivity to electrical transient upset and allow retention of logic state information with loss of power. Operational circuit equations are developed in detail, as are laboratory results of upset testing of an illustrated design example using standard T2L NAND gates."
"Realization of the 64-bit MNOS/SOS memory circuit demonstrates the feasibility of the design approach. Design techniques such as two-MNOS-transistors-per-bit cell, differential read circuitry and the implementation of PMOS resistive load static logic were used in the memory circuit to test their effectiveness and suitability for much larger nonvolatile radiation-hard memory arrays in SOS. We have shown that the 64-bit MNOS/SOS memory circuit can be successfully fabricated with tight uniformity uniformity of discrete device parameters. The MNOS transistors used in the circuit were processed to perform either as a RAM-type device or as an EAROM-type device. Also, discrete devices and the circuit have exhibited memory retention times in excess of three years. Additionally, we have verified that the circuit can survive total dose irradiation greater than 300K rads and maintain stored information after transient dose irradiation up to 1012 rad/sec."
"Analyses and process investigations of a 108 op amp fabrication sequence have been conducted. The analysis was initiated with a total dose characterization of 108 op amps that indicated that total-dose sensitive commercial devices could be radiation hardened by modifying their standard processing. Subsequent failure analysis identified the critical op amp failure modes as primarily the result of superbetagain loss and leakage increase. A process-flow analysis with MOS capacitors on the selected baseline fabrication sequence was followed by a study of specific processing steps on the radiation performance of 108 op amps. Amplifiers, transistor test devices and MOS capacitors were evaluated. Emphasis was placed on processing steps near the end of the process sequence. Using the defined process it was possible to fabricate 108 devices with minimal degradation at 106 rads(Si). Some relaxation of initial 108A performance is required for the hard devices."
"A potentially catastrophic environmental phenomenon was recently discovered; large discharges and arcs on spacecraft. This phenomenon, induced by magnetospheric substorm events, was probably responsible for numerous spacecraft malfunctions and at least one spacecraft failure. More often, however, the electromagnetic interference resulting from the arc is induced into various spacecraft circuits which leads to triggering of integrated circuit switches, multivibrators and one-shots. In addition, the arcing phenomenon has given rise to degradation of thermal blankets (by vaporizing the vacuum deposited aluminum [VDA] present on the blanket), contamination of surfaces by vaporization products, triggering of light sensitive devices, and anomalous functioning of scientific sensors. The general program, undertaken by the engineering and scientific community, in response to this phenomenon, includes the following major elements: 1) the development of a standard environmental specification to cover the geomagnetic substorm environment; 2) the development of general design requirements and criteria-guidelines for design of spacecraft to be resistant to the effects of geomagnetic substorms; 3) the development of analytic tools to determine and predict stress levels induced by the substorm charging environment; 4) the development of test programs to verify the immunity of spacecraft to environmental substorm charging and arcing; and 5) the requirement for housekeeping data, environmental data, and laboratory test data. The purpose of this paper is to review the charging phenomenon, its hazards and the response of the scientific and engineering community during the past few years. The similarities and differences between spacecraft charging and SGEMP will also be discussed."
"A fiber optics data link modeled after general designs discussed in satellite systems studies has been designed, built, and radiation tested. Radiation effects were considered in the link design with emphasis on permanent degradation and transient outage time performance. A design goal of 1-msec transient outage time was established. The testing was for a simulated prompt-ionization environment and a simulated trapped-electron environment, which are of principal concern in evaluating the performance of a link. In prompt-ionization testing, an outage time of 300 μsec or less, set by the detector amplifier IC recovery, exists up to a dose of 104 rad(Si). Above this dose, the recovery of absorption in the fibers rapidly becomes longer and increases link recovery time to 1 sec or more at a dose of 105 rad(Si). Thus, the fiber optics link met the design goal for doses up to 104 rad(Si). In the steady-state electron testing, it was predicted from data extrapolation that the link could survive five years or perhaps more in the natural space environment in synchronous orbit. The limit was set by the fiber absorption produced. This survival time could be increased to in excess of 20 years by relatively simple electronic changes. Thus, a fiber optics link is also viable in a natural space environment. In a pumped-up, trapped-electron environment, the high initial fluxes exist for only short periods and then decay. Link survival depends on the actual flux behavior."
 "The CMOS Radiation Effects Measurement (CREM) experiment is presently being flown on the Explorer-55. The purpose of the experiment is to evaluate device performance in the actual space radiation environment and to correlate the respective measurements to on-the-ground laboratory irradiation results. The experiment contains an assembly of CMOS and P-MOS devices shielded in front over 2π steradian by flat slabs of aluminum of 40, 80, 150, and 300 mils (1.02, 2.04, 3.81, and 7.62mm) thicknesses, and by a practically infinite shield in the back. This paper presents initial results obtained from the CREM experiment. Predictions of radiation damage to C-MOS devices are based on standard environment models and computational techniques. A comparison of the shifts in CMOS threshold potentials, that is, those measured in space to those obtained from the on-the-ground simulation experiment with Co-60, indicates that the measured space damage is smaller than predicted by about a factor of 2-3 for thin shields (t < 100 mils), but agrees well with predictions for thicker shields. It is not clear at this time how the trapped particle environment models or the computational methods should be modified in order to achieve better agreement between experimental results and predicted damage curves. A subsequent paper will present some considerations along these lines as well as an evaluation of performance of C-MOS devices located in a typical electronic subsystem box within the spacecraft."
"A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of various solar cell types exposed on both surfaces to isotropic irradiation by protons and electrons which approximate the effects of space irradiation. In addition to the normal damage mechanism of lifetime degradation in the base region, another important damage mechanism of series resistance increase was produced by the particles incident from the rear. This damage is produced in the contact region by the low-energy, or high-angle-of-incidence particles which penetrate only this far. The series resistance increase is at least as important as the lifetime degradation in causing the maximum power to degrade. An effective hardening technique is to p+-dope the back surface so that a higher fluence is required to remove enough carriers that the contact resistance increase becomes significant. On the other hand, lithium-doping of the cells hardens those irradiated from the front only by producing defects that are not as effective as the normal ones in degrading the lifetime. Therefore, it is not useful for cells irradiated from the back. This is because the lithium \"hardening\" mechanism involves additional carrier removal, which adversely affects the series resistance when significant damage is produced near the rear contract. This series resistance increase causes the lithium-doped cells, especially the float-zone ones, to degrade much more rapidly. The other findings of the study are essentially the same as results on cells irradiated from the front surface only. Lower sensitivity cells damage at a faster rate, and the spectral response shows a larger degradation in the red region. This latter point means that cells with an enhanced violet response would not degrade as rapidly as similar cells without the enhanced response."
"The performance of 10 cell types from 3 manufacturers shows non-irradiated, glass-covered cell efficiencies ranging from 10.3 to 13. 6% after prolonged photon illumination for cells having thicknesses from 215 to 370 μm. Efficiencies after irradiation by 1-MeV electrons to a fluence of 1E15 e/cm2 ranged from 8.0 to 9.2 percent. The degradation in power output as a result of 1E15 e/cm2 irradiation ranged from 31 to 32% for cells with a 2 ohm-cm base resistivity and from 28 to 30% 0 for 10 ohm-cm cells. Cells having a P+ back surface field showed the highest degradation in each resistivity group. Only a cell group using float-zone material showed significant photon degradation after electron irradiation. All other cell types showed annealing of electron irradiation damage of up to 5% after 3E15 e/cm2 irradiation. The solar absorptance for the high efficiency cells ranges from 0.78 to 0.93."
"A mathematical model has been developed which predicts the annealing kinetics of electron, proton, and neutron damage in lithium-doped silicon solar cells. The model to be presented uses the diffusion-limited reaction theory modified to account for excess lithium consumption and varying defect capture radius. Experimental data from short term radiations with 1 and 10 MeV electrons, 0.25, 1.0, and 2.0 MeV protons, and reactor neutrons are shown for comparison with calculated annealing curves. Data from a 24-month real time test in a simulated space environment of vacuum, Compton electrons, 100 keV protons, and UV radiation are also presented to illustrate the success of the model in predicting long term effects in cells where simultaneous damage introduction and annealing is occurring. These data are particularly interesting because they indicate that 1) the annealing of electron and proton damage is similar and apparently involves the same lithium-defect interactions, 2) that the annealing of neutron damage, while its annealing kinetics are similar and can be described by the same mathematical model as electron and proton damage, involves different defect-lithium interactions and the neutron annealing appears to be independent of prior cell histories in electron and proton environments, and 3) irradiations in combined environments of electrons and low-energy protons produce synergistic effects that are not predicted by any current damage models in both conventional cells and lithium doped cells."
"The electrical equilibrium of a satellite at high altitudes, representing the balance between emission and accretion of charge at the satellite surface, requires for its existence the stability of the potential and charge distributions throughout the space surrounding the satellite. In the following, we consider the stability of equilibrium states of geometrically simple satellites illuminated by solar radiation and exposed to the charging environment of the rarefied plasmas at plasmaspheric and magnetospheric altitudes. Sufficient conditions for stability are established on strictly analytical grounds and, in the case of satellites large compared to the Debye length, λD, sufficient conditions for equilibria to be unstable are given. The stability of various equilibria are investigated numerically by means of a one-dimensional particle simulation of a collisionless plasma."
 "The results of an investigation of the bleaching of radiation-induced darkening in ten Schott optical glasses is presented. Measurements were made at several temperatures from 160K to 340K for times from 5 msec to 500 hours after exposure. The theory of processes distributed in activation energies has been used to formulate a model which explains the time and temperature dependence of the bleaching. Analysis of the bleaching results in terms of this model has yielded the activation energy distributions and \"frequency factors\" which govern the bleaching for each material."
 "A statistical model is described and employed to calculate inverse mean free paths and stopping powers for electrons of energies from a few eV to 10 keV above the Fermi level in Al, Si, Ni, Cu, Ag, and Au. Brief tables of mean free paths and stopping powers for these solids are presented. In some cases graphical displays of inverse mean free paths and stopping powers are also included. The calculations based on this model are discussed and compared with previous work."
"A method of analysis is presented which reproduces well the results of electron Monte Carlo calculations of dose enhancement profiles in silicon and polyethylene adjacent to gold irradiated with 10-300 keV x-rays. A simple physical derivation of the coefficients employed in our analysis is then given. In the resulting model, only data from standard compilations of x-ray absorption coefficients and continuous electron slowing down ranges are necessary for evaluating the dose enhancement profiles. This permits estimates of dose profiles in material combinations that have not yet been studied using Monte Carlo methods. The limitations and implications of these results are discussed and potentially useful areas of future effort indicated."
 "A new method for Monte Carlo electron transport calculations has previously been outlined. Briefly, the method is as follows: the quantity of interest (e.g., x-ray photoemission angular distribution) is expanded in a complete set of orthogonal functions; the individual trajectories of the Monte Carlo sample are used to calculate the expansion coefficients; the resulting coefficients are used to evaluate a (continuous) representation of the relevant distribution. In this paper we discuss this orthogonal function expansion method at some length. A precise mathematical formulation is given to two types of expansions: expansions of the probability density of a random variable; expansions of functions defined on a stochastic process. The method as formulated is then used for several problems of practical interest. The POEM Monte Carlo electron transport code has been modified to provide expansions for the following: one- and two-dimensional x-ray photoemission angular distributions; dose enhancement profiles near high-Z/low-Z interfaces, and energy distributions for finite beams incident on an interface. A discussion is given of the applicability of the method, particularly as it relates to the specific applications. Several pathological examples are cited which indicate the discretion necessary in applying the technique. These examples serve to counterpoint the desirable properties of convergence, smoothing, and variance reduction which arise from a properly applied expansion."
"A numerical method has been developed for accurate and efficient calculations of charged particle flux-at-a-point in com& lex geometries. Accurac is obtained using the condensed history Monte Carlo technique. Efficiency is obtained by first sampling particle energy and direction at the poinlt of interest and then tracking the particle backwards (particles speed up) to the source."
"A high precision calorimetric method has been employed to measure electron energy deposition profiles in multilayer configurations for normally incident source electrons at an energy of 1.0 MeV. The results are compared with the predictions of a coupled electron/ photon Monte Carlo transport model. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for an Al/Au/Al configuration, while significant discrepancies are observed in the case of C/Au/C and Be/Au/Be configurations. Several potential problems are discussed but no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancies has been found."
"Charge deposition profiles in thin planar layers of aluminum, tin and tantalum next to various combinations of thick layers of aluminum, copper, tin and lead have been measured under cobalt 60 irradiation. The gamma ray beam is collimated and its energy spectrum is measured. The gamma intensity is accurately determined so that the absolute charge deposition can be related to the gamma beam intensity and spectrum. The geometry is one dimensional slab. Data is tabulated for 44 combinations of the various materials allowing for extensive comparison with computer calculations."
"Electron beam evaporation is often selected as a method for depositing the gate metal for metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) devices. X-rays generated by electron impact on the metal to be evaporated may produce damage in the gate oxide. Several experimenters have reported that radiation-hardened MOS devices metallized in electron-gun systems appear to degrade at a faster rate than devices fabricated identically except for the metallization technique used. In order to examine ways of minimizing the damage introduced by electron beam systems and to develop a basis for understanding the physical phenomena observed, the physics of the x-ray energy deposition during the metallization process was explored. Details of the calculational procedure, the data necessary to calculate the x-ray absorbed dose in the oxide layer due to the electron-gun deposition of aluminum and chromium, and the calculations are presented. The results of experimental measurements of the x-ray dose are included for comparison. The implications of the results including the differences in the radiation susceptibility of MOS devices prepared with different gate metals are discussed."
"Thick-target bremsstrahlung energy deposition in a thin, gold calorimeter has been measured as a function of converter foil thickness for Mo, Sn, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Ta converters at source electron energies of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 MeV. The thickness-maximized deposition is not a monotonically increasing function of converter atomic number, but instead exhibits a broad maximum near the type 4f rare-earth region. This maximum is substantially greater than the deposition from the Ta converter--Ta being a material routinely employed in flash x-ray sources. Theoretical models also predict higher deposition from La converters than from Ta converters and are used to show that this enhancement is a consequence of higher characteristic x-ray production in La. Nevertheless, there remain significant discrepancies between theoretical predictions and measured data, even when improved numerical cross sections which have just become available are employed in the calculations."
"A modelization for the calculation of the electrical response of irradiated multilayer structures is described. Almost all the general experimentally observed behaviours are reproduced with an acceptable accuracy. The code is simple enough to be used for a large number of practical situations."
"In experiments involving the exposure of targets to X-ray pulses, it commonly happens that illuminated surfaces are slanted to the incident beam, so that the arriving X rays strike the surface at an angle #x003B8; ≠ #x003B8; with respect to the surface normal. When this situation occurs, we show that there is generated an electromagnetic pulse emanating from the surface predominantly in the direction corresponding to specular reflection of the incident X rays. We present the theory of the generation of this EMP. With approximations that are valid in many experimental situations, we find that the radiated field amplitude is proportional to tane and to the normal spatial integral of the electron current density. We discuss the differences of conducting or dielectric targets, and give qualitative formulae for finite-size target corrections to our large target equations."
"Scaling laws for the nonlinear system-generated electromagnetic pulse (SGEMP) problem are defined and resulting implications for theory and experiments are explored. The scaling laws are used to present calculations in a scaled format which permits display of responses to a wide range of variations in fluence, spectrum, pulse width, and characteristic dimension. Interesting trends in the solutions as a function of these excitation parameters are noted and discussed."
"An analytical formulation for the prediction of SGEMP surface current response is presented. Only two independent dimensionless parameters are required to predict the peak magnitude and rise time of SGEMP induced surface currents. The analysis applies to limited (high fluence) emission as well as unlimited (low fluence) emission. Cause-effect relationships for SGEMP response are treated quantitatively, and yield simple power law dependencies between several physical variables. Analytical predictions for a large matrix of SGEMP cases are compared with an array of about thirty-five computer solutions of similar SGEMP problems, which were collected from three independent research groups. The theoretical solutions generally agree with the computer solutions as well as the computer solutions agree with one another. Such comparisons typically show variations less than a \"factor of two\"."
 "Perturbations introduced into the system-generated electromagnetic pulse (SGEMP) response arising from backscattered electrons are explored. Both the external response of a cylinder and the internal response of a cavity are treated. Perturbations in peak response are found to be as much as a factor of three at certain points on the structures, while perturbations up to 20% are found in the peak response at points on the structure where the response is maximum."
"This article discusses the relative merits of particle pushing versus direct differencing of Boltzmann's equation for solving space-charge-limited problems in the presence of secondary emission. Direct differencing seems preferable in two-dimensional geometries and hardvacuum environments. A set of numerical solutions are presented for the problem of a long gap 3cm wide illuminated by a 2 keV blackbody pulse carrying 1.45×10-4 cal/cm2. The gap is normally illuminated, and is presumed to be bare aluminum on one side, and mylar-coated aluminum on the other. The different emissivities of these two surfaces cause a voltage to develop across the gap. Omission of secondary-electron effects leads to predicted voltages which are a factor of two higher than those obtained with secondary-electron effects inclusion."
"A model is presented for the calculation of radiation-induced signals in multiconductor electrical cables. The model employs a Monte Carlo method for the calculation of the radiation-driven charge displacement within the cable and a Green's function to translate charge displacement into induced currents on conductors. The model, which is applicable to cables of arbitrary cross-sectional geometry and material configuration, permits consistent treatment of such effects as gaps, residual air, spatially-dependent transient conductivity arising from dose enhancement, saturation, and polarization-effects. These effects have, by improper treatment or neglect, limited the applicability and accuracy of previous models. Results are presented demonstrating the effects of gaps, residual air, dose enhancement, and dielectric liners and illustrating the distribution of signals on many-conductor cables."
"Assessment of the vulnerability of electronic systems to SGEMP requires the knowledge of currents and voltages appearing at individual interface circuits. Recent assessment practices treat coupling either as an interaction of the fields with each individual wire isolated from the remaining wires in the bundle, or as an interaction with all the wires in the bundle as a single entity. We describe here an effort to predict the coupling of the bulk current to individual wire current using both a detailed and simplified model of the cable bundle. The loads were chosen to represent a typical distribution of loads on a spacecraft, and the ability of the models to predict the coupling was investigated. Measurements of the coupling were made on two-cable bundles in the laboratory, and the results are compared to those predicted by the models. Calculations of the probability of survival of typical interface circuits show that the 10 dB accuracy to which the currents can be predicted with the simplified models requires only a modest increase in safety margin over the safety margin required with exact knowledge of the currents."
"An analytical technique is presented for predicting the individual wire currents on multiconductor cable bundles in X-ray environments, and an equivalent circuit model is developed which is applicable to low fluence environments. Analysis has been verified in tests conducted in the Simulation Physics SPI-5000 flash X-ray environment."
"An analytical technique and experimental verification are presented for the response of shielded twisted pair cables to ionizing radiation. The common mode current of three sizes of cables is found to vary from 3.6 to 3.9×10-6 Amps/m/cal/cm2-sec. The individual wire current was found to vary from 0.23 to 2.3×10-6 Amps/m/ cal/cm2-sec, over the range of loads considered. The effects of air and multiple exposures are discussed. The model developed is applied to several differential mode configurations."
"This paper extends previous studies of electrical excitation techniques for SGEMP simulation by considering simulation in terms of basic electromagnetic response parameters. Thus, fundamental properties of Maxwell's equations and basic symmetry relationships are emphasized rather than detailed computer calculations or specific experimental data."
"This paper presents an experimental and analytical description of IEMP produced with electron beams. Time-dependent measurements are reported of the radial distribution of the current transmitted across a 12-inch-diameter cylindrical cavity, as a function of air pressure within the cavity, for two types of electron pulses - a short pulse of 4 kA peak, 30-nsec FWHM, and a long pulse of 10 kA peak, 100-nsec FWHM. Measurements of the injected beam parameters are also reported, including a determination of the spectrum of the emitted electrons as a function of time, using a simple magnetic spectrometer. DYNACYL calculations of transmitted current as a function of air pressure for the short-electron-pulse case are summarized. The DYNACYL calculations give a qualitative description of the transmitted current time history, in most cases agreeing within a factor of 2 with the experimental data. Discrepancies are thought, in some instances, to be due to inaccurate specification of the injected beam parameters, as well as to the simplifications employed in the computer code."
"A possible method for generating SGEMP-like surface currents and fields about a satellite-like object has been studied. The method involves spraying electrons from an electron beam machine onto the object so as to reproduce responses which occur under photon illumination. It has been found that by spraying from a particular machine and for a particular geometrical arrangement, it is possible to obtain good reproduction of surface currents produced by photon illumination, even for many cases of severely space charge limited conditions. Electric fields normal to the body are reproduced well at significant distances from emitting or sprayed surfaces, but not so near or on such surfaces. At very low intensities of emitted photon-induced currents where space charge effects are insignificant, all fields and currents can be well-reproduced by spraying, with some electric field sign reversals near emission (or collection) surfaces."
"An alternative to utilizing laboratory photon sources, which have limited capabilities for the investigation of space-charge-limited SGEMP response, is to use large-area electron beams , which are readily available. If the experiment is analyzed by the same methods used for the analysis of a photon exposure, a validation of a major portion of the SGEMP analysis procedure is possible. An experiment is reported in which a 30-cm diameter electron pulse from one of the Simulation Physics, Inc., generators was emitted from the center of a 60-cm diameter, 2-meter long cylinder located on the axis of a 3-meter diameter, 4-meter long vacuum tank. Magnetic field measurements were made at nine locations on the cylinder, and at the outer tank wall. The characteristics of the electron beam (peak current ~3.5 kA, mean energy ~12 keV, FWHM ~2.5 nsec) were measured with the same diode setting and beam profile. Electron spectra were obtained with the SPI magnetic spectrometer at three radii. Computer calculations with the ABORC code, using the measured time-dependent electron spectrum, gave excellent agreement with the magnetic fields measured at various locations on the cylinder."
"Results from an investigation involving the experimentally measured and calculated electromagnetic response of two mathematically tractable geometries exposed to 12 MEV thick-target bremsstrahlung are presented. One geometry involving parallel plates, which can be adequately described by a one-dimensional model, was used to study the interaction of a partially ionized gas with a negatively charged conducting surface. The results indicate the existence of a boundary region, consisting of an electron depletion layer, that can effect the electrical response of systems in an ionized gas environment. A more complicated geometry involving concentric cylinders was used to check the adequacy of our calculational procedure which utilized a finite differencing solution of Maxwell's equations. The experimental results indicate that the electrical response of the more complicated geometry can be approximately described by our calculational procedure; but, the requirement for refinements (such as the inclusion of the boundary layer effects and adequate Monte Carlo transport source descriptions) may be warranted."
"When X rays illuminate a material surface they eject electrons backwards which then congregate in a relatively thin layer near the surface. We study the structure of this layer in the steady state limit in the cases in which the electron emission angular distribution is proportional to cosθ, where θ is the emission angle measured from normal, and when the electron energy distribution is either exponential or linear times exponential. These cases closely approximate the real world when the incident X-ray source has a blackbody spectrum."
"This paper examines, both experimentally and theoretically, the basic responses at the load ends of a cable harness when the cable harness is exposed to the excitation afforded by exposure to a TEM wave of a pulsed plane-wave array. The theoretical modeling involves the solutions to the appropriate time-dependent multiwire transmission-line equations using source terms reported by Taylor, Satterwhite, and Harrison. Two specific \"cable bundles\" were examined. One was a single wire harness, which provided a simple, well-defined geometry and resulted in the elimination of many uncertainties in the theoretical modeling appropriate for the experimental investigation. The other was an eight-wire, closely coupled, harness, that was representative of a typical satellite cable harness. In the case of the single-wire harness, the comparison between theory and experiment is excellent. For the case of the multiwire harness, the uncertainties associated with the important capacitance matrix, in particular the capacitance-to-ground of the various wires, effected an order-of-magnitude agreement in the theoretically predicted and experimentally observed responses at the load ends of the individual wires."
"This paper presents a time domain solution of the specialized transmission line equations found appropriate to characterize multiconductor photon-induced response. The treatment allows generalized N+1 conductor transmission lines with layered dielectrics. The series equivalent circuit takes the conventional form, but the shunt equivalent circuit is modified as described in the PEMTL development. The numerical techniques used in the coding of the problem follow those indicated by Merewether, which employ a \"centered\" finite difference methodology. This technique rapidly and accurately solves the time domain partial differential equations. Combined with a photon source code such as PEMTL, this solution provides a powerful research tool in the analysis of the photon induced response of complex multiconductor cables."
"A new flux-transfer technique has been used to measure the total neutron flux to an accuracy of 5% at the Army Pulse Radiation Facility (APRF) fast pulse reactor. Use is made of 239Pu-loaded fission chambers developed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and calibrated against a 252Cf source at NBS. Advantages of the method are that it uses a standard source for calibration, that it is independent of errors in fission foil masses and that the effects of cross-section errors are minimized by the need to use only cross-section ratios. Therefore, the method can serve as a calibration procedure that is readily amenable to interlaboratory comparison. The results show that previous dosimetry is 18% too high in the APRF in-core irradiation facilities, and 21% too high at core surface. Flux calibrations have also been made by using 237Np, several uranium isotopes, and the 32S(n,p)32P reaction. Fluxes from all measurements agree to 7%. The (>10 keV/>3 Mev) flux ratios determined for the glory holes and leakage spectra are 8.4 ± 0.6 and 7.3 ± 0.5, respectively."
"Measurements have been performed on the perturbing effect of a number of scattering materials by the 'free-field' neutron leakage spectrum from a Godiva Type Critical Assembly (White Sands Missile Range Fast Burst Reactor). The results of these measurements are interpreted in relation to some of the general parameters characterizing a neutron environment, namely, the average neutron energy >10 KeV, the spectral index and the hardness parameter. Three neutron spectrum measurements have been performed, each under different experimental configurations of scattering materials. Results from these measurements show the following with relation to the spectral index: (1) The neutron environment on the core surface and at 12-inches from the core surface (free-field) yield a spectral index of 6.8, (2) The neutron environment behind a 4.75-inch Plexiglas plate yield 4.6 for the spectral index and (3) The neutron environment behind a 2-inch aluminum plate yield 6.7 for the spectral index. With relation to the hardness parameter of a neutron environment, the respective values are 1.11, 1.22 and 1.12. Other spectral parameters are 1.54 MeV, 1.89 MeV and 1.55 MeV respectively, for the average neutron energy >10 KeV. These measurements are compared to the 'free-field' neutron leakage spectrum (measured at 20-inches from the core surface) in which the average neutron energy is 1.53 MeV, the spectral index is 6.7 and the hardness parameter is 1.12."
"An experiment was performed to assess the magnitude of the differences in neutron damage to silicon transistors under various conditions encountered in fast burst reactor testing. Transistors were subjected to free-field pulse and free-field power run exposures, and to exposures shielded by lead and by paraffin. These tests provided data to compare to damage results obtained under routine test conditions, i.e., relatively unperturbed field but with the experiment table in place. Fission foils and an activation foil were exposed with each group of transistors. The objectives of the experiment were: 1) to determine if perturbations in the reactor testing environment would produce measurable differences in the relative damage in silicon transistors--greater than the statistical variations characteristics of the test groups, and 2) to determine if the observed differences in damage could be correlated with the results of fission and activation foil neutron fluence measurements. Neutron exposures were performed at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Fast Burst Reactor (FBR). Thin fission foils were exposed adjacent to lexan plastic discs to record the resulting fission tracks. The fission foils were exposed inside cadmium shields which were placed inside 10B shields. Sulfur pellets were exposed both inside and outside the boron shields. The fission track and sulfur counter data were evaluated using techniques similar to those specified in ASTM standard procedures. Relative silicon damage measurements were obtained by exposing groups of carefully characterized transistors."
"The objective of this study was to devise wafer level AC measurement procedures as an aid to the development of production line radiation hardness assurance screens and controls for complex Integrated Circuits (ICs). This objective was met using a commercially available AC probe and associated test equipment in conjunction with removable probe pads connected to critical circuit node points. The procedure was demonstrated for the test case of 100% electrical screens for neutron effects on transistors on dielectrically isolated linear circuits. Prediction accuracies (using a damage factor obtained independently) averaged 4% with a 4% standard deviation. This test case was only a part of the more general development program which is still in progress. A number of other applications for the measurement procedure are described."
"A major disadvantage of bulk CMOS integrated circuits is that they can exhibit SCR behavior when exposed either to modest levels of ionizing radiation (· γ ≃ 108 rads (Si)/sec) or to an overvoltage (which is typically less than the substrate to p-well avalanche voltage). This paper discusses the successful application of gold-doping to CMOS integrated circuits to control substrate minority carrier lifetime, thus preventing latch-up. Data is presented showing the effects of the gold-doping upon junction integrity, oxide charge, surface state density, and radiation hardness. Junction arrays and split lots of a CMOS LSI circuit were fabricated to demonstrate that the gold-doped process does not reduce device yield. Data after bias-temperature stress-aging indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in the reliability between gold-doped and undoped CMOS circuits."
  "A silicon calorimeter dosimetry system is described which is capable of the accurate measurement of radiation doses as low as 10 rads(Si) from a single radiation pulse. This system offers a significant advantage over TLD systems in that it measures deposited dose in a material of interest by directly measuring the temperatture rise induced by the radiation rather than indirectly via measuring energy deposition in an exposed TLD material. The system utilizes a thin film thermistor to detect the radiation induced temperature rise in a small block of silicon. Because the system uses a commercially available instrumentation amplifier and silicon backed thermis-or, it can be readily constructed with available materials."
"When operational amplifiers are exposed to high levels of neutron fluence or total ionizing dose, significant changes may be observed in input voltages and currents. These changes may produce large errors at the output of direct-coupled amplifier stages. Therefore, the need exists for automatic compensation techniques. Hlowever, previously introduced techniques compensate only for errors in the main amplifier and neglect the errors induced by the compensating circuitry. In this paper, the techniques introduced compensate not only for errors in the main operational amplifier, but also for errors induced by the compensation circuitry. Included in the paper is a theoretical analysis of each compensation technique, along with advantages and disadvantages of each. Important design criteria and information necessary for proper selection of semiconductor switches will also be included. Introduced in this paper will be compensation circuitry for both resistive and capacitive feedback networks."

"Consider n processes operating asynchronously in parallel, each of wich maintains a single \"special\" variable which can be read (but not written) by the other processes. All coordination between processes is to be accomplished by means of the execution of the primitive operations of a process (1) reading another process's special variable, and (2) setting its own special variable to some value. A process may \"die\" at any time, when its special variable is (automatically) set a special \"dead\" value. A dead process may revive. Reading a special variable which is being simultaneously written returns either the old or the new value. Each process may be in a certain \"critical\" state (which it leaves if it dies). We present a coordination scheme with the following properties. (1) At most one process is ever in its critical state at a time. (2) If a process wants to enter its critical state, it may do so before any other process enters its critical state more than once. (3) The special variables are bounded in value. (4) Some process wanting to enter its critical state can always make progress to that goal. By the definition of the problem, no process can prevent another from entering its critical state by repeatedly failing and restarting. In the case of two processes, what makes our solution of particular interest is its remarkable simplicity when compared with the extant solutions to this problem. Our n-process solution uses the two-process solution as a subroutine, and is not quite as elegant as the two-process solution."
"A basic question in the area of asynchronous computation is: Given a synchronization problem, what synchronization primitives are needed for a solution? This paper is directed toward answering this question by characterizing the \"behavior\" of synchronization systems incorporating PV, PV multiple, PV chunk and PV general synchronization primitives."
 "The Folklore is replete with stories of \"secure\" protection systems being compromised in a matter of hours. This is quite astounding since one is not likely to claim that a system is secure without some sort of proof to support the claim. In practice, proof is not provided and one reason for this is clear: although the protection primitives are apparently quite simple, they may potentially interact in extremely complex ways. Vague and informal arguments, therefore, often overlook subtleties that an adversary can exploit. Precision is not merely desirable for protection systems, it is mandatory."
"Program structure is defined in terms of a simple graph grammar, the \"semi-structured flow graph grammar,\" which admits many of the control structure extensions suggested for \"structured programming.\" The grammar defines a set of graph reductions which are shown to have the \"Finite Church-Rosser (FCR)\" property; i.e., when applied in any order to a graph, the limit (when no further reductions are possible) is unique. In particular, if a given graph is generated by the grammar, repeated application of the reductions will result in a single node regardless of the order in which they are applied. This property gives rise to an algorithm that parses a given program flow graph in time linear in the size of the graph. The resulting parse is used in a global data flow analysis algorithm which requires a number of bit-vector steps which is also linear in the size of the given graph."
"Straight line programs in which array elements can be referenced and set are considered. Two programs are equivalent if they compute the same expression as a function of the inputs. Testing the equivalence of programs with arrays is shown to be NP-complete, while programs without arrays can be tested for equivalence in linear time. Equivalence testing takes polynomial time when programs have either no references or no assignments to array elements."
"There are languages which can be recognized by a deterministic (k + 1)-headed oneway finite automaton but which cannot be recognized by a k-headed one-way (deterministic or non-deterministic) finite automaton. Furthermore, there is a language accepted by a 2-headed nondeterministic finite automaton which is accepted by no k-headed deterministic finite automaton."
"Some of the questions posed by Baker, Gill, and Solovay [1] are here answered. The principal result is that there exists a recursive oracle for which the relativized polynomial hierarchy exists through the second level; that is, there is a recursive set B such that Σ2P,B ≠ π2P,B. It follows that Σ2P,B ⊂≠ Σ3P,B."
"In this paper we investigate the structure of sets which are complete for various classes. We show, for example, that sets complete for deterministic time classes contain infinite polynomial time recognizable subsets, thus showing that they are not complex almost everywhere. We show by a related technique that any set complete for NEXP_TIME contains an infinite subset in DEXP_TIME, thereby showing that these sets do not require the use of non-determinism almost everywhere. Furthermore, we show that complete sets for deterministic time classes have effective I.O. speed-up to a polynomial; this strengthens a result of Stockmeyer."
 "A model of parallel computation based on a generalization of nondeterminism in Turing machines is introduced. Complexity classes //T(n)-TIME, //L(n)-SPACE, //LOGSPACE, //PTIME, etc. are defined for these machines in a way analogous to T(n)-TIME, L(n)-SPACE, LOGSPACE, PTIME, etc. for deterministic machines. It is shown that, given appropriate honesty conditions, L(n)-SPACE ⊆ //L(n)2-TIME T(n)-TIME ⊆ //log T(n)-SPACE //L(n)-SPACE ⊆ exp L(n)-TIME //T(n)-TIME ⊆ T(n)2-SPACE thus · · //EXPTIME = EXPSPACE //PSPACE = EXPTIME //PTIME = PSPACE //LOGSPACE = PTIME ? = LOGSPACE That is, the deterministic hierarchy LOGSPACE ⊆ PTIME ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME ⊆ ... shifts by exactly one level when parallelism is introduced. We give a natural characterization of the polynomial time hierarchy of Stockmeyer and Meyer in terms of parallel machines. Analogous space hierarchies are defined and explored, and a generalization of Saviten's result NONDET-L(n)-SPACE ⊆ L(n)2-SPACE is given. Parallel finite automata are defined, and it is shown that, although they accept only regular sets, in general 22k states are necessary and sufficient to simulate a k-state parallel finite automaton deterministically."
"We define alternating Turing Machines which are like nondeterministic Turing Machines, except that existential and universal quantifiers alternate. Alternation links up time and space complexities rather well, in that alternating polynomial time equals deterministic polynomial space, and alternating linear space equals deterministic exponential time. Such considerations lead to a two-person game complete in polynomial time, and other games complete in exponential time. We also find that computability on a parallel processing machine is a rather rugged notion, and present two parallel processing models that are polynomially equivalent in their running times. We also show that while n-state alternating finite automata accept only regular sets that can be accepted by 22n-O(logn) state deterministic automata, alternating pushdown automata accept all languages accepted by Turing machines in deterministic exponential time."
"This paper deals with logics of programs. The objective is to formalize a notion of program description, and to give both plausible (semantic) and effective (syntactic) criteria for the notion of truth of a description. A novel feature of this treatment is the development of the mathematics underlying Floyd-Hoare axiom systems independently of such systems. Other directions that such research might take are also considered. This paper grew out of, and is intended to be usable as, class notes [27] for an introductory semantics course. The three sections of the paper are: 1. A framework for the logic of programs. Programs and their partial correctness theories are treated as binary relations on states and formulae respectively. Truth-values are assigned to partial correctness assertions in a plausible (Tarskian) but not directly usable way. 2. Particular Programs. Effective criteria for truth are established for some programs using the Tarskian criteria as a benchmark. This leads directly to a sound, complete, effective axiom system for the theories of these programs. The difficulties involved in finding such effective criteria for other programs are explored. The reader's attention is drawn to Theorems 4, 16, 18 and 22-24, as worthy of mention even out of the context in which they now appear. 3. Variations and extensions of the framework. Alternatives to binary relations for both programs and theories are speculated on, and their possible roles in semantics are considered. We discuss a hierarchy of varieties of programs and the importance of this hierarchy to the issues of definability and describability. Modal logic is considered as a first-order alternative to Floyd-Hoare logic. We give an appropriate axiom system which is complete for loop-free programs and also puts conventional predicate calculus in a different light by lumping quantifiers with non-logical assignments rather than treating them as logical concepts. Proofs of all theorems are relegated to an appendix."
 "This paper presents a formulation, within the framework of initial algebra semantics, of Knuthian semantic systems (K-systems) which contain both synthesized and inherited attributes. This formulation permits a precise definition of K-systems, and combines their intuitive appeal with the theoretical power of algebraic methods. The basic approach consists of algebraically specifying the semantic portion of a given K-system, converting this K-system into another equivalent one which contains only synthesized attributes, and then defining the new equivalent K-system by means of an algebraic formulation. The practical implications of the algebraic definition of K-systems are discussed, and the combined use of Knuth's original formulation and the algebraic approach for the development of semantic definitions is advocated."
"To each family C of interpretations corresponds an equivalence relation among program schemes, namely the equivalence of the program schemes for all interpretation of C. A family C is algebraic if any two programs are C-equivalent iff every partial finite computation of one of them is C-equivalent to some partial finite computation of the other. Our main theorem states that a family C is algebraic iff it is represented with respect to the equivalence of programs by a single interpretation (a C-Herbrand interpretation) which is algebraic (in Scott's sense, roughly speaking). We give examples of algebraic and non algebraic families."
"In a wide variety of situations, computer science has found it convenient to define complex object as (fixed-point) solutions of certain equations. This has been done in both algebraic and order-theoretic settings, and has often been contrasted with other approaches. This paper shows how to formulate such solutions in a setting which encompasses both algebraic and order-theoretic aspects, so that the advantages of both worlds are available. Moreover, we try to show how this is consistent with other approaches to defining complex objects, through a number of applications, including: languages defined by context-free grammars; flow charts and their interpretations; and monadic recursive program schemes. The main mathematical results concern free rational theories and quotients of rational theories. However, the main goal has been to open up what we believe to be a beautiful and powerful new approach to the syntax and semantics of complex recursive specifications."
"A context-free language is said to be simple if it is accepted by a single-state deterministic push-down store acceptor that operates in real-time and accepts by empty store. While the problem remains open of deciding whether or not the language accepted by a deterministic pushdown store acceptor is simple, it is shown that this problem is equivalent to another problem in schemata theory. This question is that of determining whether or not a monadic recursion scheme has a strongly equivalent free scheme."
"We consider heuristics which attempt to maintain a binary search tree in a near optimal form, assuming that elements are requested with fixed, but unknown, independent probabilities. A \"move to root\" heuristic is shown to yield an expected search time within a constant factor of that of an optimal static binary search tree. On the other hand, a closely related \"simple exchange\" technique is shown not to have this property. The rate of convergence of the \"move to root\" heuristic is discussed. We also consider the more general case in which elements not in the tree may have non-zero probability of being requested."
  "In this paper we investigate the performance of hashing algorithms that begin the search into the table with k independent random probes."
"Trie structures are a convenient way of indexing files in which keys are specified by values of attributes. Records correspond to leaves in the trie. Retrieval proceeds by following a path from the root to a leaf, the choice of edges being determined by attribute values. The size of a trie for a file depends on the order in which attributes are tested. We show that determining minimal size tries is an NP-complete problem for several variants of tries. For tries in which leaf chains are deleted we show that determining the trie for which average access time is minimal is also an NP-complete problem. Our results hold even for files in which attribute values are chosen from a binary or ternary alphabet."
"We develop optimal algorithms for forming the intersection of geometric objects in the plane and apply them to such diverse problems as linear programming, hidden-line elimination, and wire layout. Given N line segments in the plane, finding all intersecting pairs requires O(N2) time. We give an O(N log N) algorithm to determine whether any two intersect and use it to detect whether two simple plane polygons intersect. We employ an O(N log N) algorithm for finding the common intersection of N half-planes to show that the Simplex method is not optimal. The emphasis throughout is on obtaining upper and lower bounds and relating these results to other problems in computational geometry."
"Several polynomial time approximation algorithms for some NP-complete routing problems are presented, and the worst-case ratios of the cost of the obtained route to that of an optimal are determined. A mixed-strategy heuristic with a bound of 9/5 is presented for the Stacker-Crane problem (a modified Traveling Salesman problem). A tour-splitting heuristic is given for k-person variants of the Traveling Salesman problem, the Chinese Postman problem, and the Stacker-Crane problem, for which a minimax solution is sought. This heuristic has a bound of e + 1 - 1/k, where e is the bound for the corresponding 1-person algorithm."
"Motivated by an elementary programming system for formal language generation, we propose a generalized a pushdown acceptor which uses both a checking stack and a pushdown store in original manner. In the analysis of the machine-model parallel rewriting appears to be a fundamental tool for breaking the implicit recursion-structure. Variations of the machine-model (in the sense of Cook) lead to a natural hierarchy of machines defining DLOG, NLOG, P, NP, and PSPACE, showing different ways in which one class may be considered a restriction of another (as anticipated also in Galil's work on hierarchies of complete problems). Various applications in language theory and in the study of complexity classes are discussed."
"Let P1 = {w ε Σ*:w = wR, |w| ≫ 1} be the set of all nontrivial palindromes over Σ. In Part I, we present a linear-time on-line recognition algorithm for P1* (\"palstar\") on a random-access machine with addition and uniform cost criterion. We also present a lineartime on-line recognition algorithm for P12 on a multitape Turing machine and a recognition algorithm for P12 on a two-way deterministic pushdown automaton. The correctness of these algorithms is based on new \"cancellation lemmas\" for the languages P1* and P12. In Part II, we present real-time recognition algorithms for the languages {wxyxz ε Σ*: |w|=r|x|, |y|=s|x|, |z|=t|x|} and {wxyxRz ε Σ*: |w|=r|x|, |y|=s|x|, |z|=t|x|} on multitape Turing machines, for arbitrary fixed r, s, and t."
  "In an earlier paper [1], the author showed that certain problems involving sparse polynomials and integers are NP-hard. In this paper we show that many related problems are also NP-hard. In addition, we exhibit some new NP-complete problems. Most of the new results concern problems in which the nondeterminism is \"hidden\". That is, the problems are not explicitly stated in terms of one of a number of possibilities being true. Furthermore, most of these problems are in the areas of number theory or the theory of functions of a complex variable. Thus there is a rich mathematical theory that can be brought to bear. These results therefore introduce a class of NP-hard and NP-complete problems different from those known previously."
"We employ elementary results from the theory of several complex variables to obtain a quadratic lower bound on the complexity of computing the mean distance between points in the plane. This problem has 2N inputs and a single output and we show that exactly N(N-1)/2 square roots must be computed by any program over +, -, ×, ÷,) √, log and comparisons, even allowing an arbitrary field of constants. The argument is based on counting the total number of sheets of the Riemann surface of the analytic continuation to the complex domain of the (real) function computed by any algorithm which solves the problem. While finding an exact answer requires O(N2) operations, we show that an ε-approximate solution can be obtained in O(N) time for any ε ≫ 0, even if no square roots are permitted."

 "A tensor technique is described for dealing efficiently with the time-varying topology of a 3-phase SCR convertor during a digital computer solution. A significant feature of the technique is that once a basic analysis has been performed, the equations for any particular topology are automatically assembled by the program. Theoretical results are shown to be in close agreement with experimental measurements."
"The alpha beta heuristic has been used extensively as a means for reducing the tree-searching effort in computer game-playing programs. It is well known that if the number of terminal nodes in a tree is N, then under optimal circumstances the alpha beta heuristic reduces the actual number of nodes examined to about 2N½. This is a substantial reduction in the case that N is on the order of ten thousand to a million. Unfortunately these optimal conditions are equivalent, in the case of game playing, to having immediate knowledge for every position in the tree as to which alternative is the best one; and this amount of foreknowledge would make tree searching unnecessary in the first place! This paper explores quantitively the performance of the alpha beta heuristic under a wide variety of conditions other than the optimal one, including several situations occurring in actual game-playing programs."
"The progress of semiconductor technology has been a dominant factor on the use of cellular arrays in digital computer design. When a subsystem is implemented in the form of a cellular array, it is important that the subsystem can be tested at the array terminals for the presence of a faulty cell in the array. In this paper some sufficient conditions for the testability of two-dimensional sequential cellular arrays are derived. These can be either unilaterally interconnected or bilaterally interconnected arrays where each cell has some storage elements and logic circuits."
"Lee's algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm, which is often used in computer-aided design systems to route wires on printed circuit boards. This paper discusses some variations of Lee's algorithm which can be used in certain contexts to improve its efficiency. First, it is shown that, by storing frontier cells in an array of stacks rather than a single list, costly searching operations can be eliminated without significantly increasing storage requirements. Second, it is shown that if each path's cost is the sum of the weights of its cells then retrace codes can be assigned to cells as soon as they are reached rather than when they are expanded. Third, it is shown that if the additional restriction is made that each cell's weight is not a function of the state of any nonneighbor cell, then an encoding scheme requiring only two bits/cell can be used for both rectangular and hexagonal grids."
"Memory has always been a major factor in determining the cost of a computer system. Many schemes have been proposed for reducing memory cost without degrading system performance or increasing system cost or complexity significantly. This paper presents a particular data type that may have been used occasionally by programmers who have had to simulate floating-point hardware by software. This new data type is useful in large scientific problems and may be able to serve as a replacement for floating-point data type on special-purpose processors. Its hardware implementation on orthogonal and pipeline processors is discussed in detail and the implications of these implementations for a programming language (APL) (Iverson's language) are examined."
"A software interpolator which is comprised of linear and circular interpolations is compared with its hardware counterpart and with other circular interpolation methods. The software interpolator and the feed-rate control are contained in the numerical control (NC) program of a computer numerical control (CNC) system and enable a contouring control of the machine tool in any required feed-rate."
"A minicomputer has been interfaced with keyboards, visual display projectors, and vending devices, forming a 24 hour/day teaching instrumentation system for linguistic studies with a chimpanzee. Employing visual, geometric word-symbols with a 12-element construction (9 elements and 3 colors) a 4 year old female chimpanzee over a 2 year period has learned 70-80 words which she uses productively in numerous sentences to gain most of her sustenance, entertainment, and companionship (human). The computer evaluates her inputs for proper syntax and mediates in conversations between her and the experimenters. All interchanges are recorded."
"This paper deals with the problem of identifying multiple stuck-type hardware failures in combinational switching networks. Our work is an extension of that of Poage, and Bossen and Hong, and we employ the cause-effect equation for representing faulty circuit behavior. We introduce the concept of solving simultaneous equations over check point variables. These check point solutions are studied in detail. From the solutions one can calculate the function realized by a faulty circuit. We outline an on-line testing procedure for constructing a test set for identifying a specific fault in a circuit to within an equivalence class. This procedure eliminates the need for precalculating a fault dictionary, which, in many instances, can be quite advantageous. We also outline how to apply these techniques to the following problems: 1) identifying redundancy; 2) determining the set of faults not detected by an arbitrary test set; and 3) constructing a complete fault dictionary."
"In this paper, a control mechanism for a shuffle-exchange interconnection network of N cells is proposed. With this network it is possible to realize some important permutations in log2 N shuffle-exchange steps. In the control mechanism presented, the control variables at step k are determined by a Boolean operation of the control variables at step k - 1. The Boolean operation is very simple so that little additional hardware is required for this computation. This control scheme requires only one bit per cell instead of a destination tag of log2 N bits required by a control mechanism presented previously. The network can be used for the interconnection of memory modules and processors in an array computer, and for the accessing of blocks of consecutive data in large dynamic memories. It is also shown that the shuffle-exchange interconnection network permits the efficient partitioning of an array computer into subarrays to allow for the simultaneous computation of several identical problems."
"This paper considers the problem of detecting the local similarity between templates in a given class and a given image using a hierarchically ordered sequential decision rule. When the given set consists of a large number of templates and the number of locations in the image matching any of the templates is small, it is wasteful to examine each of the templates at every location in the image for a match. Instead, it is proposed that the set of templates be partitioned and a ``representative template'' be defined for each of the partitions. Several levels of partitioning are defined. Elimination of mismatching locations and termination of computation can take place at each, level of detection. Each level of testing is over a more restrictive subset of the template class than the previous level. The paper presents a general formulation of this approach and gives criteria for selecting representative templates, the ordering of components of a template vector for error evaluation, and the threshold sequences to be used in deciding about a ``match.'' Suboptimal solutions are given satisfying these criteria. Illustrative examples are provided showing recognition of linear features in test patterns and photographs obtained by aerial and spaceborne sensors."
"The Boolean difference expansion of Boolean algebra is generalized to finite (Galois) fields. A systematic method is provided for calculating the coefficients of this type of multivariable polynomial expansion. It is applied then to the synthesis functions. Applications include multivalued logics as well as binary-valued logics."
"Height-balanced binary trees with height unbalances up to Δ are investigated, and the asymptotic value of the height h of such trees is studied for an increasing number of nodes N. It is shown that, in the worst case, the asymptotic value of h is a logarithmic function of N: [h = K log N]n→∞. Specifically, an upper bound for h can be posed as: h ≤ K1 log (N+2) - K2 for Δ ≤ 3; and h ≤ K1 log (N+K2) - K3 for Δ = 4. Less strict bounds are posed for Δ > 4."

"We describe and assess computer programs for measuring pneumoconiosis in chest X-rays. The 36 films studied had been read by 11 skilled human observers and a radiological score of pneumoconiotic severity was therefore available for each film. The computer assigns to each square grid of side 3.6 mm a measure which reflects the ``unevenness'' of the density distribution in that grid. The computed score is defined as the mean diversity over all relevant grids in both lung fields. On the set of 36 films the correlation between radiological score and computed score was 0.88. By contrast the correlation between the score assigned by a single observer and the average of the scores assigned by the other 10 was in the range 0.95 to 0.99. The program can use the computed score to classify a film to one of the four major UICC categories, the success rate of this process being 80 percent as compared to those quoted by other workers in the range 45 percent-65 percent. If the films used in this study are typical then the program described may form the basis of an automatic method for measuring pneumoconiosis in epidemiological work."

 "In multiple digital recording peripheral systems, the errors which are encountered are burst-type errors which may occur in several tracks or channels. This paper discusses methods and implementation procedures for correcting a series of errors or erasures of arbitrary length in any one or two tracks of a multi-channel system. We have shown that such errors in multiple tracks may be detected and corrected using a two-redundant Hamming code over a Galois field mathematical structure in conjunction with error track pointers. The detection/correction scheme considered here can correct N-bit blocks, thereby correcting an error burst of arbitrary length in any single or pair of tracks. The error-correction (EC) scheme is shown to be applicable to two types of data formats or arrays. Additional error detection is provided to check the validity of error correction to enhance reliability above that of double error correction. Implementation methods pertaining to the above EC scheme are discussed. Examples of single and double error corrections for two types of data formats or arrays are included."
"Various switch designs for the hybrid redundancy scheme are studied. A reliability model for the switch is developed and the switch is shown to be a significant factor in the overall system reliability. A hybrid redundancy scheme with a triple-modular redundant (TMR) core may have a maximum attainable reliability for only a spare or two. Adding spares complicates the switch enough to cause the system reliability to actually decrease. There exist conditions under which the switch becomes so complex that simple TMR would yield a better solution. Models for fault-tolerant switch designs are also obtained. Finally, various designs are compared via their reliability models."
"This paper deals with an anomalous behavior of input synchronizers which results in the occurrence of random errors in asynchronously interfaced synchronous digital systems. The errors are caused by the undefined response time of a flip-flop as it recovers from its metastable state. To obtain their frequency, the timing diagram of the flip-flops has been analyzed and the probability distribution of the anomalous response times has been measured. As an example, maximum response time of SN74S74 is estimated on the basis of a set of statistical measurements. The measurement technique presented may be used for any type of input synchronizer. Two well-known methods of reducing failure probability for SN74S74 are evaluated. Two fundamental solutions of the metastable-state problem in the clocked systems are described."
"This paper is intended as a tutorial review of certain digital image processing transform techniques utilizing the notion of outer product expansions. Examples from Fourier, Walsh, Haar, and other well known transforms are reviewed in the notation of matrix-vector outer products; and implementation of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of large sized images is presented. The use of the SVD as an aid in image restoration utilizing the pseudoinverses is presented. Conditions on the point spread matrix are investigated in the light of singular value decomposition, Kronecker products, and general imaging conditions."
"The discriminating content addressable memory (DCAM) is a modified content addressable memory (CAM). After the ``similar to'' search performed by the CAM, the modified memory searches in parallel for the highest value in a particular field across all words of the memory. Applications of DCAM can greatly speed up queue searches and scheduling processes in operating systems. Worst case DCAM query time for 1000 words is 2 μs. The number of extra gates required by a DCAM increases linearly with memory size."
"The optimum capacity of a cache memory with given access time is determined analytically based upon a model of linear storage hierarchies wherein both the hit ratio function and the device technology-cost function are assumed to be power functions. Explicit formulas for the capacities and access times of the storage levels in the matching hierarchy of required capacity and allowable cost are derived. The optimal number of storage levels in a hierarchy is shown to increase linearly with the logarithm of the ratio of the required hierarchy capacity and the cache capacity."
"Let W be an N-dimensional vector space and let the signal locus V be a K-dimensional topological hypersurface in W. The intrinsic dimensionality problem can be stated as follows. Given M randomly selected points (signals) vi, vi ϵ V, estimate K, which is the dimensionality of V and is called the intrinsic dimensionality of the points vi. A statistical method, which is developed from geometric considerations, is used to estimate the dimensionality. This ad hoc statistical method avoids the approximations and assumptions required by the maximum likelihood solution. The problem of estimating dimensionality in the presence of additive white noise is also considered. A pseudo, signal-to-noise ratio, which has meaning with respect to estimating the dimensionality of a noisy signal collection, is defined. A filtering method, based on this ratio, is used to estimate the dimensionality of a noisy signal collection. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by estimating the dimensionality of a collection of pulsed signals which have four free parameters."
"In this paper we propose a new method for correcting garbled words based on Levenshtein distance and weighted Levenshtein distance. We can correct not only substitution errors, but also insertion errors and deletion errors by this method. According to the results of simulation on nearly 1000 high occurrence English words, higher error correcting rates can be achieved by this method than any other method tried to date. Hardware realization of the method is possible, though it is rather complicated."
"In two-class pattern classification problems, the use of piecewise linear discriminant functions (PLDF's) is often encountered. Following a consideration of the relative advantages of a PLDF above an optimal-high degree-discriminant function, a new procedure to compute a concave PLDF is presented. The characteristic property of this procedure is that the number of linear functions necessary for adequate results of the PLDF is determined adaptively during the procedure. The linear functions are computed with Chebyshev polynominals."
"This paper reports some results on the use of parallel-structured computers to detect and describe concavities in simply connected planar regions (``domains'' or ``blobs''). We show, in particular, how these concavities may be obtained by a parallel filling-in process-somewhat like pouring liquid into several cups simultaneously. It has been shown that the concavities and concavity tree of a regular cellular blob (i.e., a digitized simply connected planar region) can be obtained by the use of a sequential algorithm that finds the minimum-perimeter polygon (MPP) passing through the boundary cells of the cellular blob. In this paper we show how any such MPP may be computed by a sequence of simultaneous local operations in a parallel-structured computer. We also show that the ratio of computation times for sequential algorithms to those for parallel algorithms operating on the cellular image of a large circular blob is approximately proportional to the square root of the blob's perimeter, assuming the size of the vertex-detecting window is fixed and large enough to detect one or more vertices of the MPP. We also show that filling in the concavities by a sequence of parallel local operations terminates to an approximation of the cellular hull (i.e., the digitization of the convex hull of the original blob) in a finite time, and that this approximation is a subset of the cellular hull."
"This correspondence presents results concerning the display of interpolated images for cosmetically pleasing effects. Replication, bilinear interpolation, and various cubic spline function interpolators are investigated as to numeric computational difficulty and psychovisually pleasing results. A degree of freedom analysis is provided to demonstrate the fact that apparent image improvement does not necessarily increase the inherent quantitative information within an image."
"This correspondence proposes a new algorithm for deriving all pairs of compatible and incompatible states of any incompletely or completely specified sequential machine. The method needs a single step in checking the contents of the closure classes with respect to each pair of distinct states. A working example is given for illustrating the method by hand computation. The algorithm is implemented by a PL/I program and executed by using the incomplete machine of the example as input data on an IBM system 370/Model 158. These demonstrations assure that the algorithm is feasible and efficient for both hand computation and computer execution."

  "A quantitative and systematic design procedure for multiple function-unit (MFU) processors and microprocessors is presented in this paper. The MFU organization employs a set of function units such as adders, multipliers, etc. to concurrently execute instructions from a single instruction stream. A set of parameters describing this processor organization and the programs it executes are presented. The instruction execution rate is used as the measure of performance. This can be defined as the number of instructions executed per unit time. An analytic model is presented which relates the performance of a processor to the parameters describing it. A general problem is formulated: ``Construct a processor that is optimal with respect to a certain design criterion.'' Two design criteria, which specify two design problems, are presented. The minimum cost (MC) problem specifies an optimal processor as one with a minimum cost while maintaining a minimal acceptable performance level. The maximum performance-to-cost ratio (MPCR) problem requires that the performance-to-cost ratio be maximized for the optimal processor. The design problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming problem. The branch and bound technique and other considerations are introduced to reduce the extent and amount of enumerations required. Illustrative examples are provided."
"An improved simulation of pulse propagation between integrated digital circuits is presented. Two novel improvements associated with the inverse Laplace transform used are presented; 1) the introduction of two-dimensional weight factors σn,m and 2) the use of a shifting parameter a. The algorithm proposed is very fast and saves considerably on computer memory. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques are also employed. The computed results agree well with the experimental observations using TTL gates. The technique deals with arbitrary input waveforms, lossy lines, aperiodic tap-off loads, and is extended to large large-scale integrated (LSI) digital systems and crosstalk prediction."
"This paper is concerned with automatic fault diagnosis for digital systems with multiple faults. Three problems are treated: 1) Probabilistic fault diagnosis is presented using the graph-theoretic model of Preparata et al. The necessary and sufficient conditions to correctly diagnose any fault set whose probability of occurrence is greater than t have been developed. Some simple sufficient conditions are also discussed. 2) A general model that contains as special cases both the graph-theoretic and the Russell-Kime models is developed. Conditions for T-fault diagnosability are given, thus settling some open problems introduced by Russell and Kime. 3) Finally, sequential T-fault diagnosability is considered. Existence of a class of systems requiring as little as n + T - 1 tests is shown. This improves significantly upon the previously best known class of systems that required n + 2T - 2 tests for sequential T-fault diagnosability."
"A family of multiple-valued (MV) electronic memory elements, referred to herein as flip-flops, is presented along with a system of MV algebra upon which they are based. These MV flip-flops are compared to binary flip-flops. MV asynchronous set-clear flip-flops and synchronous set-clear, D-type, JK, and modulo N counter flip-flops are presented, their next-state equations are derived, and they are shown to have desirable properties for use in MV sequential circuits. Experimental results and schematic diagrams are presented for a level restoring three-valued logic gate, the clocked set-clear flip-flop, and an example synchronous sequential circuit."
"This paper is concerned with the realization of logic functions by using two-input magnetic bubble logic elements. A magnetic bubble logic element is the multiple-output logic element whose number of ``1'' 's of the output is equal to that of corresponding input, and fanout of each output terminal of the element is restricted to one. In order to realize some functions, it is necessary to use the generators which correspond to constant-supplying elements. First, the number of generators which are necessary and sufficient to realize an arbitrary functions is obtained for a given set of elements. In particular, it is shown that an arbitrary function can be realized by using IB elements and at most two generators. Since the IB element is a universal element in the above sense and is considered to be rather easily realized by magnetic bubble interactions, the IB logic circuits are mainly discussed. The IB minimum circuit defined here is a circuit which consists of minimum number of generators and minimum number of IB elements. In the last half of this paper, it is shown that the minimum circuits of most functions have the characteristic circuit structure called ``1-4 form.''"
"In this paper two recent models of basic operations in magnetic bubble memories are discussed. The accessing of an item and the generation of arbitrary permutations in these models are studied. It is shown that the two methods of accessing an item as described in this paper for the two models are optimal in terms of the number of operations. For each model, lower bounds for the number of operations needed to generate arbitrary permutations are derived for both the worst case and the average case. Consequently, the methods proposed in this paper for both models are shown to be optimal as far as the order of magnitude of the number of operations is concerned. The results obtained in this paper may be helpful for deciding upon the relative merits of these two models."
"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a syntactic approach and, in particular, a tree system may be used to represent and classify fingerprint patterns. The fingerprint impressions are subdivided into sampling squares which are preprocessed and postprocessed for feature extraction. A set of regular tree languages is used to describe the fingerprint patterns and a set of tree automata is used to recognize the coded patterns. In order to infer the structural configuration of the encoded fingerprints, a grammatical inference system is developed. This system utilizes a simple procedure to infer the numerous substructures and relies on a reachability matrix and a man-machine interactive technique for the inference of complex structures. The 92 fingerprint impressions were used to test the proposed approach. A set of 193 tree grammars was inferred from each sampling square of the 4 × 4 sampling matrix which is capable of generating about 2 × 1034 classes for the fingerprint patterns."
"Error correction of programming languages has been effected in a heuristic fashion; error correction in the information-theoretic sense is very precise. The missing link is provided through probabilistic grammars. This paper provides the theoretical foundation for the precise construction of an error correcting compiler. The concept of code distance is extended to account for syntax in language. Grammar modifications are demonstrated so that a probabilistic parsing algorithm corrects various kinds of linguistic errors using an ideal observer rule. A generalized error correcting algorithm is described."
"The spectral analysis of a long time series is often hampered by the limited capacity of the Fourier analyzer. The ideal frequency resolution of the analysis of N sample points cannot be realized if the analyzer cannot handle N points simultaneously. This paper examines some of the aspects of the zoom transform, which provides for partial recovery of the ideal resolution on an analyzer of limited capcity by concentrating the analysis on selected frequency bands."
"A self-synchronization model is developed. It is based on a general clock function which depends only on the state variables. This function is associated with the flip-flop type to be used and is independent of the flow table. A modular implementation which uses integrated circuits is obtained. With this technique, the synthesis procedures for synchronous machines can be directly applicable to asynchronous circuits without taking care of the critical races and essential hazards."
"Synchronous counters composed entirely of J-K flip-flops can be systematically designed to fit given specifications. However, known design methods do not provide useful counters for many specifications of interest. We prove that some plausible counters are impossible to construct. For example, we prove that there is no self-starting, gateless, synchronous J-K flip-flop counter with N J-K flip-flops, N ≫ 2, and a period of 2N - 1. Known design methods do not trivially generate many desirable counters, but nonexistence theorems do not show that these counters are impossible. Searching among all possible configurations of J-K flip-flops is an attractive notion, but the number of possibilities is so large that it renders such search infeasible on current general-purpose digital computers. A special-purpose digital device was designed, implemented, and operated to perform an exhaustive search of all configurations of five or fewer J-K flip-flops. Some of the discovered counters are listed in the Appendix."
"This correspondence is a modification of the basic SHR-optimal1 state assignment procedure for the D flip-flop. Under the minimum sum-of-products (MSOP) constraint, a sequential machine with n D flip-flops has 2n times as many distinct state assignments and twice as many distinct state assignment columns as the other flip-flop types. This correspondence shows that even though the D flip-flop machine has 2nN total distinct state assignments, the costs of these assignments can be uniquely determined by examination of only N of these assignments. Integration of this concept into the basic SHR-optimal algorithm produces a computational saving on the order of 2n-1 times."

A clear understanding of the proposed changes is important to anyone involved in advancing technologies where the protection of developments can be a vital ingredient for commercial success"
 "The proposal that marginal costs should be used as a basis for pricing is not new. Over the years many eminent economists have argued convincingly for and against the proposal, which has done little to advance its cause. Since the theoretical arguments of the welfare economist are not part of an already overfull engineering curriculum, and because of the obvious impracticability of the views expressed by extremist economists, most electrical rate engineers continue to use traditional tariff structures, leaving economists to argue about the merits of marginal cost pricing. This article argues the case that marginal costs can, and should, play an important role in the pricing of electricity"
"Air-source electric heat pumps can double the heat input to the home, but they are optimised for US summer conditions: British houses need a smaller, quieter, heating only unit. Although significant design improvements on the US heat pump are possible to make them more suitable, there is a competing technology that has a more immediate effect, a lower call on resources and therefore the higher priority"
 "Brushless a.c. machines have an inherent advantage compared with motors that have commutators, particularly in situations where the atmosphere is very dirty, where flameproof motors are required, or where high rotor speeds are needed. They can also be operated efficiently over their entire speed range. It is only recently, however, that the invertor-fed a.c. system has offered a serious challenge to alternative drive schemes for general industrial applications. This is most noticeable in the range from 1 to 20 kVA. Larger units are becoming increasingly competitive as full use is made of advances in power semiconductors and control techniques. Two methods of producing variable-frequency supplies from a static invertor are described, together with specific examples of equipment. The motorsupply requirements of the static supply are defined to allow the best invertor/motor combination to be produced. Applications are discussed which illustrate the unique features of the invertor fed induction motor"
"The introduction, in 1974, of Pt. 11 of BS 5000 brought into use new descriptive terminology, that of the small power motor. The new standard superseded BS 170, which covered the electrical performance of fractional horsepower motors, and new description of the range under consideration was evolved to be meaningful and to be easily translated into other languages"
"In an attempt to make the subject manageable, I intend to present three 'snapshots', so to speak, of the electricity supply industry at different points in time rather than attempt to cover the entire continuum. In the 'yesterday' section, I shall try to set the scene with a description of what the supply industry was like in the late 1930s, a period which coincides with the start of my career. This can be compared with the supply industry today, and I shall pick out the important and interesting developments and changes that have taken place. Finally, in the 'tomorrow' section, I shall attempt to give an impression of what the industry might be like in the future with special consideration to the problems it is likely to face"

Such projects cost between £100 million and £1000 million, and the economic pressure to reduce first costs and improve thermal efficiency and manpower utilisation has led to power stations becoming very large and extremely complex with many of their design features at the very limit of current technology. As their lead times are invariably longer than the rate of change of technology, commitment to technological advances has often to be made before significant operating experience has been obtained. This is not wrong in itself but it means that very sophisticated management is required to produce reliable plant"

"Electron beams are being used to make new generations of solid-state devices with critical dimensions that are less than 1 μm. Using the technique, device designers are able to overcome many of the performance limits that have been set by the conventional methods of fabrication where ultraviolet light is shone through a mask to define a pattern on photosensitive resist. The minimum practical dimension in light-exposure systems is usually greater than 1 μm although the fundamental limit set by the diffraction of light is somewhat less. In comparison the limit using electron-beam techniques is much less than 1 μm, so that one can expect substantial improvements in the specifications of surface-acoustic-wave devices, microwave transistors, narrow-gate field-effect transistor and high-density large-scale-integration devices once the techniques of electron-beam lithography are fully established"
"The role of the electronics engineer has been changing with each new development of semiconductor technology, and the microprocessor has started yet another revolution. If engineers are to keep pace with developments, they have to learn how to use this new tool and adapt their skills to it"
"There are many factors that govern the number of functions that can be realised on a single silicon chip. Limits have been reached for some of these factors with present-day technology, but, for others, further development work will lead to better i.c. performance and give the designer not only more and more on less and less, but also more and more for less and less"
"In the last decade, microwave semiconductor devices have advanced from the fundamental study of their physical phenomenon to become an accepted building block in microwave systems. Simultaneous developments in circuit technology and techniques for design and measurement have permitted the new devices to be fully exploited; for instance, solid-state amplifiers can now be used to replace travelling-wave tubes in many low-noise and medium-power applications"
            "In the heavy chemical industry, electrical drives are used up to the largest practicable size, say 10-15 MW, because of their reliability and apparent simplicity compared with steam-turbine drivers. Every drive must have a starter of some sort, and this must match the drive reliability, particularly when required to operate for up to two years without maintenance. This article points to some of the starter problems that occur in use, and to the means of minimising these to achieve reliability"
                           "Electromagnetism embraces the physical interpretation, analysis, and synthesis of electric and magnetic phenomena. To study it is to explore fundamental concepts of electrical engineering. Now concepts may seem academic and far removed from engineering requirements. The applications found in the technical papers of proceedings and transactions of learned societies belie this, and the broad interest is evident from the correspondence columns of the house journals of these societies. Another measure of the interest shown is afforded by the reception of Prof. Hammond's paper1 on the teaching of fundamentals to students. It is over 20 years since that paper was published: the content has not been changed by the passage of time, but new disciplines have emerged to change the emphasis in the subject matter taught to students. And practical calculations are now more feasible with the advent of, and continuing improvements in, digital computers. Prof. Rawcliffe's comment to the discussion of, that paper, `. . . it is desirable that, from time to time, our profession shall be led to reflect on these fundamentals', provides a pretext for the present article should one be needed"
"The bulk transmission of electrical energy in large amounts, i.e. above 1 GW, becomes essential as the demand in urban and industrial centres increases. Although at the present time increase in consumption has largely ceased, there would seem little doubt that, in the long term, electricity will become increasingly the major energy type as resources of oil and gas become depleted. Even with a much smaller rate of increase than the doubling every ten years that has prevailed, it may still be expected that the quantities of energy to be transferred will become very large. Generation will be concentrated in increasingly large units, usually remote from load centres, and implying (certainly in North America) power transfers in the range 10ߝ20 GW by the year 2000. These vast powers can only be carried economically by the use of very high voltages into the u.h.v. range, i.e. above 765kV"
"Although radar first emerged as a tool for studying the atmosphere, it soon became clear that weather radar had a useful operational role to play in detecting and tracking storm systems. Today this operational aspect is becoming more important with economic solutions to problems of radar data processing and distribution, and with the realisation that radar can be used to measure rainfall amounts, acting in effect as a distributed rainguage system with substantial coverage"
"The task facing the clinician when trying to analyse an electroencephalogram (brainwave) is a daunting one. He is often dealing with a 16-channel recording (sometimes more), and he has to examine several each day. Each neurophysiological or psychiatric department takes e.e.g.s of their patients, in the same way as a patient in a general ward has an electrocardiogram taken. Diagnosis from an electrocardiogram is relatively straight-forward, but diagnosis from an e.e.g. takes a well trained eye, and this has led to a large amount of computer-analysis work, aimed at helping the clinician in this task. This article is the first of two which review this work"
"Since the turn of the century, contactors have been used for the remote control of electric motors, and other loads. They are particularly suitable for applications requiring a relatively high frequency of switching, including the switching of operational overload currents.

"The true essence of worth in any component (electrical, mechanical or solid state) can be illustrated by the length of time the particular device has been in use.

"Following the first practical demonstration of laser action in 1960, engineers and scientists began to consider seriously the possibility of developing long-distance, high-capacity optical communication systems. The first practical systems for the civil telecommunication network are expected to be demonstrated under field conditions in Britain and elsewhere by 1977. Throughout the intervening 16 years, the development of system expertise has been closely linked with the growing capability of the optical source, and the future progress will undoubtedly depend on the advances in source performance that show promise of achievement in the next five years"
"Most measurement and mechanical inspection procedures in industry today rely on the human eye to detect flaws in materials and components, or to take readings from meters, micrometers, gauges etc. Optoelectronics can provide the engineer with the means to eliminate the human error from many such inspection procedures in the form of the line-scanning camera"
"The National Research Development Corporation was set up 27 years ago by the British Government to promote practical technology by sponsoring the development of new inventions and innovations from public and private sources. For this purpose it can borrow up to £50 million from the Treasury, of which only one-half has been taken up so far. This means that ample resources are still available to invest with industry and university to launch or accelerate new inventive projects, taking them, if necessary, through to their production and marketing phases. The NRDC is very active in the electrical and electronics industry, and this article describes some of this work"
"Switchgear has almost 100 years of development history. It has become a total concept of power-system capability in growth, operation, security of supply and in safety. Switchgear techniques have been many and varied, but rationalisation and economic factors have caused preferred arrangements to emerge and become accepted standards. This process has been pursued in British Standards and in the closely aligned International Standards. With the Treaty of Rome and the more recent entry of the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community, the harmonisation of national standards will increasingly influence our engineering in the future"

         "It is unlikely that, on putting his `idle pole' to work in probing gas discharges, William Crookes could have realised, in the latter half of the last century, that he was studying the commonest form of matter in the Universe. It is equally improbable that, in proposing electric currents in the upper atmosphere as the cause of the daily magnetic variations, Balfour Stewart would have thought of plasmas surrounding stars or even galaxies. Indeed the concept of a galaxy other than our Milky Way was yet to come, and Irving Langmuir was yet to apply the term plasma to the subtle glowing gas of the low-pressure arc. Today, however plasma is sometimes referred to as the fourth state of matter; its technological importance is great and astrophysicists recognise that by far the greater part of the Universe exists in this highly ionised condition"
"Even the bravest engineer sometimes has cause to shudder at the complexities of modern control theory. But all is not lost; Henry Power takes us by the hand and leads us gently and lightheartedly (and with help from his friend, the Mad Matrician) through the weird world of state space, observers and the enigmatic eigenvalue"
"The predominant feature of the possible future development of cable enclosures is vitality of design. The limitations of tube are fairly easily recognised, but the potentialities of trunking have yet to be investigated"
"In the past, the primary influence on British electrical installation practice has been the IEE Wiring Regulations, even though the regulations, in the main, have not been mandatory. The situation in the future is likely to change owing to the combined effects of international standardisation work, of Britain's membership of the EEC, and of certain statutory regulations being promulgated under various Acts of Parliament. This article analyses the likely long-term effects on British electrical-installation practice and standards of these various factors"
    "Scrambling of speech information has been in existence for many years, but new techniques in circuit design and the associated growth of digital communication are causing significant changes to be made"
           "After the invention of the telephone in 1876, telephony developed rapidly, more rapidly in the USA than elsewhere. Telephone exchanges were introduced from 1878, interurban links coming into use as the density of exchanges grew. Technical difficulties, commercial rivalries, and, outside the USA, governmental policies, held back the development of long-distance or trunk lines until the middle 1880s. In 1891 Britain scored a notable success in providing telephony between London and Paris, although there was no effective internal long-distance system until 1896"
"One of the most fruitful inventions in telephony took place at Bolton Percy, Yorkshire. A country curate discovered that crushed coke made a very good material for a variable-resistance microphone. That was in 1878. By 1957, the microphone and earphone that are used in almost all British Post Office telephone sets today were developed"
"In one hundred years, the art of telephony has developed from a single connection between two telephones under the same roof to the almost universal availability of connection between any of 300 million telephones in all parts of the world. This article reviews the major developments of British telephone systems since 1912"
"The practical limits of the advance of telecommunication technology and its applications may be determined, increasingly, not by engineering problems, but by the economic, legal, sociological and other constraints that society will impose"
             "Modern electronic circuitry is so compact, that it is often a designer's biggest problem to fit all the necessary control buttons on an instrument front panel. This design study illustrates one elegant solution to the problem"
"It was hardly to be expected that the semiconductor revolution would also revolutionise power engineering. Yet the humble semiconductor can now control and switch megawatts to considerable advantage"
"Fuses were first introduced in the 1880s and were used for the protection of lighting installations. They were located adjacent to the lamps and were to protect the latter from excess currents caused by source-voltage fluctuations. One of the forerunners of the modern cartridge fuse was patented in 1893 by Mordey. Fuses are still widely used in distribution circuits and for the protection of equipment, and they have evolved to cover a wide range of protection requirements from low-voltage electronic circuits to high-voltage power applications"
"The international activity on fuse standards reflects the progress that is being made, but the extent of this progress is not obvious from reading the standards. This article reviews the changes in standards that have recently been introduced, and discusses the developments that lie behind them"
"The contactor is probably still the most important switching device in industry. As yet there is no indication that the solid-state switch is ready to take the place of the less expensive, well proven contactors"
"About one-half of the faults in a.c. motors are caused by burnouts or single phasing, which indicates that many motors are insufficiently or ineffectively protected. Better motor protection is needed, and it could be provided by the use of microprocessor protection systems when the price becomes right"
"Microwaves can be defined as the happy hunting ground of microwave engineers. Microwave engineers form a community even when they branch out and make contributions, for example, in optical or acoustic waveguides. Such developments are reported in microwave publications, at least until they separate out or attach themselves to other disciplines. Thus, technology transfer takes place. However, the majority of applications to be reviewed depend on radiation at frequencies in the true microwave range, that is, at frequencies generally around 1000 to 10 000 million cycles per second (1 to 10 GHz)"
             "One of the final stages in refining copper is the removal of impurities by electrolysis-an important stage because a minimal impurity greatly reduces the conductivity of the metal. Removing impurities by electrolysis has been done commercially since the latter half of the 19th century, but modern advances in high-current-rectifier equipment have greatly raised production levels"
       "The use of magnetic materials in all forms of electrical and electronic engineering means that there is a continuous research and development interest in improving the method of utilisation and expanding the applications of existing materials. There is also never ending work, generally industrially based, on improving the methods of manufacturing existing magnetic materials and the techniques of fabricating these materials into devices. In contrast, the successful development of a new magnetic material occurs less regularly, but often has a larger impact on the commercial applications of magnetic materials than any programme of work on existing materials"
         "With the recent developments in the technology of gallium arsenide, it is likely that a greater use of this semiconductor material will emerge than at present. An important reason for this is the new understanding of ohmic-contact formation by a thin-film epitaxy process, which could possibly even find other wider applications in device manufacture now, and lead to the manufacture of normally-off m.o.s.f.e.t.s. The latter device is particularly suitable for high-speed integration and monolithic interfacing with optical devices because of its small standby power dissipation"
  "Should professional engineers join trade unions, and, if so, what factors should govern their choice? This widely debated issue is likely to have even more attention devoted to it in the coming months"
        "The dividing line between pattern recognition and artificial intelligence is very slim. Consequently, the pattern-recognition ability of the random-access memory can be utilised in implementing networks of high `intelligence'"
                                 "Although there has been a downturn in the demand for energy in the past year, the past decade has seen an unprecedented increase in electrical load growth. This has been reflected in the rapid development of large turbine generators and strategic auxiliary high-voltage motors. One important factor of the successful operation of these large units is the condition of the stator insulation; and this article deals briefly with the complete stator-insulation system from initial construction to final on-site testing and subsequent appraisal on a routine basis during overhaul periods"
"Ever since the early days of the Nickelodeons and Bioscopes, most cinema audiences have been unaware of the continually changing and developing technology at work behind the porthole in the `projection room'. The original single projector became two machines, and more recently back to one again as larger spools and their associated film-handling systems have come into use. The xenon lamp is now an alternative to the proven carbon arc as a light source. Silent films gave way to sound and Dolby systems are beginning to be used in the search for better sound quality. Automation has helped in the struggle for better presentation, and is essential in today's multiauditorium cinemas. Indeed it is the excellence of presentation by many conscientious projectionists that prevents the mechanics of the cinema from intruding into the patrons' enjoyment of the films"
"Today the benefits of electricity are usually taken for granted but the history of the electricity power supply industry forms part of the human struggle for knowledge and resources"
 "Electrical plant maintenance, particularly in continuous process industries, has never been more important than at present. The impact of rising costs, loss of revenue through outages, and shortage of skilled labour can have effects on profitability undreamed of even five years ago"
"In electronics design, the possiblity of integrating large amounts of circuit into a monolithic piece of silicon may be changing the concept and the influence of electronics in many fields. In telecommunication, the lower prices that result from the technology of large-scale integration and the effect on system architcture will be revolutionary, especially as designers realise that the freedom of optimum design is available and apllicable in practice now"
                              "If you are over ten years old, you probably have had at least one original thought. But original thoughts are useless unless you know they are original and know where to apply them"
"Prof. Sir Charles Wheatstone was one of the first to join the Society of Telegraph Engineers when it was founded in 1871. He died one hundred years ago in 1875, before the Society had become the Institution of Electrical Engineers. Despite his short period of membership he is probably the early member whose name is best known to every member of the Institution today"
"Most of the heavy electrical equipment in service today is based on designs that have been developed and refined over many years. Generally the source of materials is reasonably stable, the design bases are known and the general factory machinery and layout are established. Consequently when a component needs to be designed for a particular job, a series of standardised processes is initiated involving different groups of people and calling in supplies from outside as required. Each successful organisation will have developed a way of completing this process effectively and some of the processes adopted have been described, for example, by Hawley1. But what about the development of design principles for something that differs perhaps in only a few, but crucial, ways from the standard component? Is it possible that there is a general philosophy that can be applied?"
"The cause of the safety problems experienced by users of power-supply units in recent years is the mania for miniaturisation, a demand generated by the customer, but exploited by the manufacturers. How has this demand affected the safety of power supplies?"
"Up to the Second World War, mechanical devices and inventions were concerned in the main with increasing man's physical power. They stopped short at mechanised muscle and did not ever contemplate the mechanised mind. Today this frontier is being crossed and we have entered what I am colloquially calling the `press-button age'; we are designing and constructing machines that are capable of performing the kind of operations that have hitherto been regarded as the exclusive work of the human brain"

   "This paper presents a new algorithm for symbolic system reliability analysis. The method is applicable to system graphs with unreliable branches or nodes. Each branch is directed or undirected. Element probabilities need not be equal, but their failures are assumed to be s-independent. The new method makes no attempt to generate mutually exclusive events from the set of paths or cutsets but uses a technique to reduce greatly the number of terms in the reliability expression. Actual programming results show that the new method can efficiently handle systems having fewer than 20 paths or cutsets between the input-output node pair."
 "s-Confidence and `A' and `B' allowable factors for sample sizes 2-30, obtained by Monte Carlo techniques, for populations whose property measurements can be represented by a 2-parameter Weibull distribution are developed. The factors for the Weibull case are presented here in graphical form which allows practical engineering application and readily shows sample size effects. A numerical example illustrates the use of the factors."
"This paper presents a simple chart that provides approximate large-sample s-confidence limits for the percentiles of a Weibull life distribution estimated by maximum likelihood from singly censored data. The chart also helps determine the appropriate sample size and length of a life test. The methods are illustrated with life data on a locomotive control."
"Existing results are reviewed for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the parameters of a 2-parameter Weibull life distribution for the case where the data are censored by failures due to an arbitrary number of independent 2-parameter Weibull failure modes. For the case where all distributions have a common but unknown shape parameter the joint ML estimators are derived for i) a general percentile of the j-th distribution, ii) the common shape parameter, and iii) the proportion of failures due to failure mode j. Exact interval estimates of the common shape parameter are constructable in terms of the ML estimates obtained by using i) the data without regard to failure mode, and ii) existing tables of the percentage points of a certain pivotal function. Exact interval estimates for a general percentile of failure-mode-j distribution are calculable when the failure proportion due to failure-mode-j is known; otherwise a joint s-confidence region for the percentile and failure proportion is calculable. It is shown that sudden death endurance test results can be analyzed as a special case of competing-mode censoring. Tabular values for the construction of interval estimates for the 10-th percentile of the failure-mode-j distribution are given for 17 combinations of sample size (from 5 to 30) and number of failures."
 "Some age replacement policies are investigated and conditions for the unique existence of an optimum policy are derived. The optimum policy is the one which minimizes the expected cost per unit time over an infinite time span or maximizes the proportion of time during which the system is in operation. Losses have been expressed through increasing operating cost, if the objective is to minimize the expected total cost per unit time and through increasing renewal times if the objective is to maximize the availability of the system."
 "A system with a special operating unit is considered. We determine when the spare unit should be delivered and replaced for the original one, where the delivery time is considered. Four models are introduced and the delivery policy for each model is found which maximizes the s-expected net earning rate (with no discount) or the total s-expected net earnings (with discount)."
 "We have studied the operational behaviour of a complex system consisting of two classes of units (with standby redundancy in one class) under two repair disciplines, viz., preemptive-resume and preemptive-repeat. Units have constant failure rate, while repair follows general probability distributions. Supplementary variable and Laplace transform techniques have been used to obtain the transient state probabilities for such a system. From these, steady state behaviour of the complex system has been examined."
 "s-Confidence limits are established for the Availability of a standby redundant system (1-out-of-N:G system) for both hot and cold spares consisting of several identical units and repair facilities. The failure and repair rates of the units are s-independent, constant, and estimated from test data."
"Assuming constant failure rate and general repair distribution, this paper treats the availability of the 2-out-of-n:F system by identifying an imbedded Markov renewal process."
 "Failure of products due to the combined processes of nucleation and growth of deleterious phases is discussed and categorized. Reliability predictions are made for both catastrophic and progressive failure. The technique is very general and relates the thermodynamic and kinetic data of the failure mechanism to product lifetime. Measurements of nucleation and growth rates might result in savings of product test-time and money."
"A reliability growth model is an analytic tool that accounts for changes in reliability due to design modifications and other corrective actions taken during the develpment, production, and use of a new piece of equipment. This paper describes a simulation study, and its conclusions, comparing four general reliability growth models that have been proposed in the reliability literature. Details of the simulation results are available in a separate Supplement."

"Current switching in power control devices sometimes has serious noise difficulties. This paper presents a method of testing and measuring noise immunity. The noise immunity of a thyristor with magnetic core or unijunction transistor is analyzed and measured. The experiment agrees well with the theory."
"When the reliability of an electric power system is evaluated by the Loss-of-Load Probability (LOLP) method, it is customary to take into account the uncertainty in load forecasts by associating a peak-load distribution (as a parameter expressing the uncertainty) with the assumed daily peak-load duration curve, then to compute the unconditional LOLP as an average of the conditional LOLP weighted by the parameter distribution. In this note it is shown that an alternate and simpler procedure results when first the daily peak-load curve is modified so that the uncertainty is incorporated in it, then the usual LOLP method is applied."
 "Recurrent expressions are given for point and interval unavailability of a renewable system subjected to periodic checking/repair. The expressions are generalizations of the basic relations in the theory of discrete renewal processes. The asymptotic limits for long times follow simply from a general theorem of this theory. The connection to previous expressions is established."

   "A many-state Markov model has been developed for the purpose of providing performance criteria for computer software. The model provides estimates and closed form predictions of the availability and of the most probable number of errors that will have been corrected at a given time in the operation of a large software package. The model is based on constant rates for error-occurrence λ and error correction μ. An interesting application case is when λ and μ are functions of the state of debugging achieved. This case is discussed and solved numerically. Extensions and modifications of the basic model are briefly discussed."
"Members of IEEE Reliability Group and ASQC Electronics Division can receive the following publications free of extra charge."
"This paper reports the results of an experiment whose objectives were to: 1. Develop and utilize a set of terms for describing possible types of errors, their nature, and their frequency; 2. Perform a pilot study to determine if data of the type reported in this paper could be collected; 3. Investigate the error density and its correspondence to predictions from previous data reported; and 4. Develop data on how resources are expended in debugging. A program of approximately 4k machine instructions was chosen. Programmers were asked to fill out for each error, in addition to the regular Trouble Report (TR)/Correction Report (CR) form, a special Supplementary TR/CR form for the purposes of this experiment. Both the regular and the Supplementary forms were divided into two sections. Each form consisted of a single sheet; the upper half of each form was the Trouble Report (TR), and the lower half of each form was the Correction Report (CR). Sixty-three regular and Supplementary TR/CR forms were completed during the Test and Integration phase of the program; these forms represented a little over 1.5% of the total number of machine instructions of the program (in good agreement with the 1% to 2% range noted in previous studies). A large fraction of the errors was found by hand processing (without the aid of a computer), which was much cheaper than machine testing."
"The calculation of the probability that communication between two nodes in a given network is disrupted is difficult when the number of channels is large or when the network configuration is complex. This paper presents an efficient method, formalized as an algorithm, for calculating this probability using subnetworks that are smaller than the original one. This algorithm should prove useful in practice since it permits the possibility of choosing the subnetwork decomposition that one considers best suited for a specific problem."
"Advertisement of available employment opportunities."
"For a nonoriented network, Bayesian decomposition is straightforward and well known. A keystone element is assumed perfect (shorted), then failed (open) and the reliabilities of the two subnetworks are calculated. But for an oriented network, when the keystone element is assumed perfect, it cannot always be shorted (the 2 nodes brought together), because even a perfect element still retains its orientation. A technique for choosing keystone elements is proposed."
 "In order to design an available network efficiently, a parameter characterizing the network availability is needed. The global availability is suggested and algorithms are given for its exact or approximate evaluation. The design of minimum cost networks with a given availability is discussed for different models of the cost-availability function in the links. Some example network optimizations are reported."
  "In reliability engineering and practice an important role is played by those units whose life characteristics change with time. The case is herewith considered where change underlies a nonhomogeneous Markov model. Simple repair processes then deal with a 2-state alternating policy resulting from the superposition of failure and restoration, both showing a continuous aging with time. Availability can be expressed through linear differential equations or by means of integral equations; the approaches are equivalent. A computer code is then described which calculates (i) availability, and (ii) transition densities for any continuous time dependence of failure and restoration rates. Numerical results are shown for a few examples."
 "General formulae for minimum variance unbiased estimators of a broad class of functions of the parameters of the Gaussian and gamma distributions are given. The formulae are easy to employ and are applied here to several examples familiar to the reliability engineer."

"MIL-STD-781B gives sampling plans (sequential and fixed length) for reliability tests under the assumption of a constant failure rate. Using Monte Carlo techniques, the authors compare s-expected time to a decision and producer and consumer risks for some of these plans. It is shown that plans which assume an exponential distribution are not robust to departures from that assumption. A simple modification of these plans for use when life has a Weibull distribution with known shape parameter not equal to one, and an adaptive test procedure for use when life has a Weibull distribution with unknown shape parameter are proposed. The modified plans for a Weibull distribution with known shape parameter have the same designated producer and consumer risks, but different s-expected time to a decision than the corresponding exponential plans. Using Monte Carlo techniques, the authors determine s-expected time to a decision and producer and consumer risks for various forms of the adaptive procedure."
"Three models are presented for a 2-unit standby system, Models 1 and 2 deal with a 2-unit warm-standby system with and without preventive maintenance (pm) to standby unit. Model 3 is a 2-unit cold-standby system with pm to operative unit. An income structure has been superimposed on the semi-Markov processes generated by the systems to obtain s-expected profit. For models 2 and 3, s-expected profit is suggested as the measure of maintenance effectiveness. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the results."
"The system has three subsystems: A, B, C. A has several non-identical units in series. B has 2 identical units in parallel. C has 2 identical units in standby (cold) redundancy. Switching is perfect. Unit failure rates are constant, repair rates need not be constant. The system fails if A or B fails; C is useful, but not essential. The supplementary variable technique is used to find Laplace transforms of system state probabilities."
"This tutorial paper considers a 1-unit repairable system which operates at discrete times. Some appropriate results for the system are rewritten as discrete time processes. After introducing costs this paper discusses optimum preventive maintenance policies which minimize the s-expected cost."
"A cumulative damage model with n different components is considered. The joint distribution of the total amounts of damage to n components, the distribution of the time to failure, and the failure rate are derived. The noncumulative damage model is also discussed."
 "This paper presents general algorithms for solving redundancy optimization problem for non series-parallel networks. Using closed form expressions for star-delta and delta-star conversions, the exact system reliability expression (objective function) is written down in a straightforward manner. The Box method has been employed to get the optimal continuous solution. The integer solution is obtained by a modified Box method and Branch and bound technique. The scheme is illustrated with an example. The parametric method is used throughout"
"Exact, closed-form expressions for star-delta and delta-star conversions of reliability networks are presented."
 "Two reliability models for a 2-unit cold-standby intermittently available system, whose units are subject to repair and preventive maintenance, have been studied. In Model I, the Laplace Transform of the pdf of `Disappointment time' and in Model II, the Laplace Transform of the `Interference time' are derived. Disappointment time and the interference time definitions include the demand pattern."

    "This article discusses certain key considerations in using event trees and fault trees for risk analyses, as applied in the Reactor Safety Study. The discussions emphasize applications and practical modeling implementation."
 "After discussing the general need for and advantages of risk analysis, including a summary of the previous application of risk concepts to reactor systems, descriptions are given of the existing and planned programs funded by the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration for use in advanced nuclear reactor systems. Some of the results from existing programs are given, and future efforts are described."
 "This paper describes the types of reliability and probabilistic safety studies which have been performed in the commercial nuclear power industry. The role of current and future probabilistic risk evaluations is examined in light of the overall objectives and trends within the industry. The purpose of this examination is to identify the objectives which reliability and safety studies of nuclear systems should have in order to support the objectives of the nuclear industry as a whole. Recommendations are made for the types of developments and applications which should be performed to support these objectives."
 "The threat to nuclear power as the cornerstone of energy independence has reached an unsettling high. Never has the need been greater to tell the public the nuclear story and tell it convincingly. We believe that when the facts are presented in a comprehendible manner, the public will make the right decision about nuclear power-and, to be sure, it is their decision. We further believe that reliability technology is key to telling this story. The Reactor Safety Study (WASH-1400) is a start and must be followed with an even broader application of probability methods. In this connection some ideas are presented on a unified approach, addressing not only risks but also costs, benefits, and environmental impacts. A broader look at the use of probability methods in the power field reveals considerable history and activity in planning, safety, and availability work. A backlog of ideas, techniques, and experience is building, and a strong basis for widespread use of probabilistic methods now exists."
"Prospective authors are requested to submit new, unpublished manuscripts for inclusion in the upcoming event described in this call for papers."
"This article organizes and classifies various types of quantitative analyses that can be performed on component reliability data gathered within the Nuclear Power Industry. The analyses are keyed to the form of the available data and to the purpose of the analysis."
"The qualitative evaluation of system logic models is described as it pertains to assessing the reliability and safety characteristics of nuclear systems. Qualitative analysis of system logic models, i.e., models couched in an event (Boolean) algebra, is defined, and the advantages inherent in qualitative analysis are explained. Certain qualitative procedures that were developed as a part of fault-tree analysis are presented for illustration. Five fault-tree analysis computer-programs that contain a qualitative procedure for determining minimal cut sets are surveyed. For each program (SETS, MOCUS, PREP, MICSUP, ELRAFT), the minimal cut-set algorithm and limitations on its use are described. The recently developed common-cause analysis for studying the effect of common-causes of failure on system behavior is explained. This qualitative procedure does not require altering the fault tree, but does use minimal cut sets from the fault tree as part of its input. The method is applied using two different computer programs, COMCAN and SETS."
 "Probabilistic safety analyses of the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor are being performed by the General Atomic Company. The project is sponsored by the Energy Research and Development Administration and is known as Accident Initiation and Progression Analysis. Probabilistic methods are used to estimate the probability of failure of the HTGR cooling systems."
"This essay treats aspects of quantitative evaluation of nuclear system reliability and safety. The implications extend to analysis in other industries. The article reflects an attitude stemming from experience in analyzing systems containing highly reliable hardware. The factors that contribute to the unavailability of standby safety systems at nuclear power plants are identified and are illustrated by a tutorial example. Pitfalls of quantitative analysis are discussed."
 "Battelle-Northwest (BNW) is conducting safety studies of the following nuclear fuel cycle operations: reprocessing, transportation of radioactive material, decommissioning of facilities, and waste management. Various methods and depths of analysis are used in these studies, but all involve safety quantification in terms of risk, relating probabilities and consequences of potential accidents. This paper describes the methods used for these safety studies. Highlighted are areas in which BNW contributions have extended the analytic methods: 1) a risk-based fault-tree analytic method for identification, preliminary evaluation, and screening of potential release sequences; 2) improved treatment of deposition and resuspension in airborne transport of radionuclides; and 3) groundwater transport models of radionuclide chains in soil columns, including the effects of convection, difusion, sorption, and generation and decay. Areas needing additional development are identified."
 "The Reliability Program for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Plant (CRBRP, a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor) is an integral part of the overall CRBRP design philosophy of safety in depth. The purpose of this program is to assure that the likelihood of exceeding Nuclear Regulatory Commission dose guidelines at the plant site boundaries is less than 10-6 per operating reactor year. This goal is conservatively interpreted for the purpose of a design objective as the requirement not to exceed loss of coolable core geometry to the same maximum likelihood of 10-6 per reactor year. This requirement is allocated among shutdown systems, post-shutdown heat removal systems, and other systems whose failure could result in loss of coolable geometry, a potential initiating cause of dose limit violations. Assuring that the goal will be attained in the plant is based on reliability analysis, the redundancy and diversity inherent in the design, and the verification test program."
 "This paper is an expository survey of some recent academic research in the theory of system reliability and safety, applicable in the analysis of large complex systems such as nuclear reactors, computers, and space vehicles. The survey emphasizes new approaches in reliability theory, many nonparametric, rather than standard parametric approaches."

"This paper considers a 2-unit warm-standby redundant system with repair. The repair of a failed unit is constrained as follows: Associated with each failure of a unit is a random variable termed the Maximum-Repair-Time (MRT) of the failure. If the repair of a failed unit is not completed within the MRT, the unit is rejected for further use. Two types of failure stituations for the system are considered: 1) No allowed down time, and 2) Some allowed down time. Expressions for the Cdf of the Time to System Failure (TSF) and the mean TSF are derived by using Markov renewal processes."
"This paper analyses the reliability of a 2-unit standby redundant system consisting of two dissimilar units. Unit 1 performs the desired system function whenever available for use. Unit 2 operates only during those periods when unit 1 is undergoing repair. Unit 1 can be repaired at most N times. Expressions for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the Time to System Failure (TSF) and the mean TSF are derived."
 "The reliability of 3 models is investigated. The system is not down unless it is failed when there is a demand. Model 1 is a 2-unit parallel system. Model 2 is similar to model 1 except that if there are 2 users, the system is used as two 1-unit systems, one for each user. Model 3 consists of two model 2 systems in series."
"A device is said to have three states if it has one good state and two mutually exclusive failure modes; e.g., in one failure mode, it operates when it shouldn't, in the other it doesn't operate when it should. Some examples of such devices include a fluid flow valve, an automatic machine, and an explosive. A Markov model is developed to obtain the availability function of such a device."
"Expressions for various reliability measures are given for competing failure modes, mixtures of s-independent populations and the stochastic combination of the two cases."
 "This paper employs the Mellin transform to derive the exact posterior pdf and Cdf of the reliability of a system consisting of s-independent units in parallel, based on pass-fail data obtained from testing the units. From a tabulation of the posterior Cdf, arbitrary Bayesian limits can be obtained for the reliability of the parallel system. A computer program for determining the requisite posterior pdf and Cdf is operational."
 "This paper provides a detailed synthesis and analysis of a cost effective, ultrareliable, high speed, semiconductor memory system. The memory system has the capability of detecting and correcting over 99% of all single faults. The memory cycle time of 250 ns is not compromised unless a fault is encountered. The increase in circuitry for the fault-tolerent system, over the simplex system, is less than 20%. These results have been achieved through the use of special coding implementations, virtual codes, and selective redundance."

The algorithm is based on Boolean algebra and set theory, and contains many important improvements. The four most important features are 1. only one set of topological input data is required to evaluate the minimal cuts and reliability indices of every output node; 2. a mix of undirectional, bidirectional and multi ended components can be included very simply; 3. any number of input nodes may be specified; 4. a new concept of overall system reliability permits different, large, and complex systems to be compared. The computational efficiency of the algorithm is clearly indicated by the fact that the time required to analyse Example 1 on a CDC7600 was 0.7 sec. The storage required with the appropriate arrays dimensioned for a system having 100 components and up to 125 minimal cut sets per output node is 15 k-words. These times and storage include the overall system reliability analysis."
 "The effects of maximum allowable uses and mission losses on space shuttle reusable-item inventory are analyzed. The approach was applied to preliminary trade-off studies of the solid rocket booster reusable components. Reuse reduces considerably the quantity of items required for 445 launches over an 11-year period. The effect of maximum allowable uses on the total number of items to be manufactured is highly nonlinear. The effect of mission cycle reliability is approximately linear. The trade-off analysis is illustrated by the example of rocket-motor case cylinder segments. The analysis is applicable to any reusable booster component."
 "The effectiveness of an actual combat tank system is analyzed. A measure of effectiveness (called pseudo-reliability) which is the reliability of a system weighted by the relative-performance is introduced. It appears to be a more practical measure of the system effectiveness than reliability whenever the level of performance is of primary concern as is the case for the combat tank system. A model is used to optimize the design of the system in which the system pseudo-reliability is maximized subject to a cost constraint. This model involves nonlinear programming and is solved by the sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT). A numerical example with actual data from the test evaluation of five combat tanks illustrates the model."
"The Avionics Logistics Effects (ALE) model was developed in 1973 in response to a US Navy requirement to evaluate potential benefits of reliability and maintainability improvements that might be incorporated into the AWG-9 weapon control system on the F-14 aircraft and AWM-23 ground support equipment. The model simulates the entire F-14 aircraft (avionics and non-avionics) in terms of squadron flight operations, maintenance, and support aboard an aircraft carrier. Its major application is to determine the impact of avionics system design and maintenance changes on aircraft availability. Several studies have been performed with the ALE model, and one in particular is discussed in this paper. In this case, Hughes recommended 27 separate reliability and maintainability improvements to the AWG-9/AWM-23 systems. The contribution of these improvements to F-14 availability is discussed, with particular emphasis on achieved crisis-flight rate."
"The maximum Fusing Voltage (FV) (for 0.1-10 μs pulses) of Mo/Si, Ni/Cr, and Si/Cr resistors formed on oxidized Si substrates has been experimentally shown to be essentially independent of the following parameters: 1) resistive film material, 2) passivation film material (but a crack-free film is important for Ni/Cr resistors) and 3) the thickness of the oxide fim between the resistor and silicon substrate (0.5-1.5 μm). The FV depends on the resistor geometry, substrate material, and post fabrication annealing of the resistors. The most commonly used resistor geometry is adequate for use on ICs. The most dramatic change in FV obtained in the study was for resistors formed on glass substrates. The FV was reduced by almost a factor of 2 for 0.1 μs pulses over that of resistors on Si substrates. Post fabrication annealing resulted in marked increases in FV for each material for the 0.1 μs pulses but had diminishing effects for 1.0 and 10 μs. Annealing for times greater than 60 minutes or temperatures greater than 470° didn't result in important further increases."
"Analytic determination of reliability of general systems becomes increasingly difficult as the system complexity increases. Inclusion of s-dependent components and/or allowing repair of failed components makes such analysis virtually impossible. This paper extends the Monte Carlo simulation procedure of Kamat and Riley to estimate the reliability of such systems. A computer program finds all minimal tie-sets from a coded reliability flow graph and performs the simulation. In each replication, the s-dependency of failures and/or repair of failed components is incorporated in the generation of pseudorandom time-to-failure through modification of the failure rate for each affected component. A search through the minimal tie-sets identifies the success or failure of the system at each value of required time of operation. The computer program estimates the system reliability as a function of time with approximate individual (for each time point) 95 percent symmetric s-confidence limits."
"Taking into account the real characteristics of redundant digital structures leads to neglect of failures occuring during the repair instants. The formal definition of the corresponding hypotheses leads to a simplified Markov model which a) is homogenous and b) has instantaneous repairs. At last, the paper describes the way by which the validity of the hypotheses can be judged."
 "We consider a component with a random number of defects which can be discovered and corrected during the course of a burn-in program. The failure rate after burn-in is constant (in time) and depends on the number of remaining defects. A sufficient condition is given for a burn-in program to lead to increased mean time to failure; it is given in terms of the prior distribution of the number of defects and the failure rates."
"Advertisement of available employment opportunities."
"Equipment mean time between failures (MTBF) is assumed to be a frequency random variable. The goodness of fit of the uniform prior as a probability model for the MTBF is compared to the goodness of fit of the inverted gamma prior for actual failure data. These distributions can both be adequately fitted to the same failure data when the method of moments is used to fit the distributions. A comparison of posterior producer and consumer risks in a Bayesian reliability demonstration test is made using the fitted inverted gamma and uniform distributions as the priors. There can be rather large differences in the values of the posterior risks even when the two priors fit the data equally well or equally poorly."
 "Two solutions are proposed for estimating s-confidence intervals for reliability of a repairable series system comprised of non-constant failure rate components: 1) the system is treated as a sum of renewal processes with the mean and variance of total number of system failures being computed from the moments of failure times of the components; and 2) a pseudo-Bayesian solution is derived for the mean and variance of the log-reliability of a system of Weibull components. In both solution approaches, the central limit theorem is invoked for a sum of component random variables determined from test data such as number of failures or log-reliabilities. s-Confidence limits are then approximated using Gaussian probability tables. The intervals derived yield close-to-exact frequency limits, depending on such variables as number of test failures, number of components, and component parameters."
 "Although the literature on reliability theory is filled with methods for optimally designing multi-component systems subject to various constraints, very little is available in the literature on methods for optimally testing such systems. Both capabilities are needed, because after a system is assembled, periodic testing is required to insure against degradation of component reliabilities. Some components in the system should be tested more than others, because of their reliability, cost of testing, or placement in the system. This paper provides Bayesian decision rules for testing components sequentially to minimize the sum of the cost of testing and the cost of misestimation."
"The paper is in 2 parts. In all models the failure rates are constant, but repair rates need not be constant. The method of supplementary variables is used for solving the models. Part I considers the effect of priorities on reliability and availability for 4 basic models; 1) priority in both repair and operation; 2) priority in repair; 3) priority in operation; 4) no priority. Models 1 and 2 treat 2 repair disciplines: a) preemptive-repeat, b) preemptive-resume. We obtain 1) Laplace transforms of availability and reliability and 2) explicit expressions for steady state availability and for mean time to system failure. The effect of priority assignment to maximize steady state availability is discussed. Part II considers the effect of having different repair rates, depending on whether the failure was from standby or from operation. We obtain 1) Laplace transforms of availability and reliability and 2) explicit expressions for mean time to system failure."
"In this paper, the availability and the reliability of two 1-server systems with redundancy have been obtained. System 1 consists of n subsystems in series; each subsystem consists of two redundant i.i.d. components in `parallel' (cold standby) and one server. The times to failure of the components are exponentially distributed; their repair time distributions are arbitrary and different. System 2 consists of n dissimilar units and one server. The times to failure of the units are arbitrarily distributed; the repair rates are constant but all different. Explicit expressions for the Laplace transform of the mean down-time of the system in (0, t) and for the mean time to system failure have been obtained. A few particular cases are discussed."
 "A device which is exposed to the cumulative damage process due to the occurrence of shocks is considered. The life distribution of the device is obtained here. Damages occur to the device when the worker is not alert or the device is weak. Known results in counter theory are used to obtain results."

    "Formation characteristics of an aluminum oxide grown by an ``aluminum + water reaction'' method are reviewed and its etching rates in some solutions are reported. The aluminum oxide protects the A1 against some chemicals, and serves, by covering the A1 surface with the aluminum oxide, to reduce the frequency of integrated circuit (IC) failures due to aluminum corrosion. Application to epoxy-encapsulated ICs shows that it greatly reduces the frequency of failures in a steam pressure test. Another application to IC chips with gold bumps shows that it drastically reduces the incidence of A1 corrosion which otherwise occurs during bump formation. This method is simple, requires no change in conventional processing, and gave satisfactory results in spite of the presence of glass defects."
 "Because of apparent anomalies noted on data recorded in tests conducted on PEDs (plastic encapsulated device) a re-examination of the influence of voltage biasing in temperature-humidity-bias testing has been conducted. Applied bias can have an important influence on the reliability of plastic encapsulated transistors, depending on how it is applied. The analysis presented in this paper on the role of bias influence on PED failure rate explains some of the discrepancies that have been noted in the past by the author and other investigators."
 "This paper reviews the highlights of some previous work in the field of Incipient Failure Detection and proposes development of general methodology for furthering the state-of-the-art. Examples are presented as early application of the technique."
 "Field failure data collected over a span of 7 years for airborne air turbine starters (ATS), which are used to start jet engines in aircraft, offer an opportunity for analysis and determination of reliability parameters. This paper presents; a) Changes in ATS equipment MTBF by year, b) Breakdown of removal causes by year, and c) Cdf of failure times."

"This paper presents the results achieved by applying Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) techniques to communication systems over the period 1968-1972. The objective of this program was to guide development of Ground Communication systems and evaluation after deployment. These systems, after field deployment, went through the normal debugging activity. By detection and proper recognition of potential problem areas, corrective action was taken to achieve the most needed improvements for least cost. The US Army Satellite Communications Agency (USASATCOMA) is the Army's focal point for a whole class of materials that are related to satellite communications. Once developed, these equipments become a part of a larger entity that must itself undergo a degree of development and testing prior to operational use as a DOD Joint Service System. The performance of the communication ground subsystem was assessed as part of the larger system, and ground subsystem availability was evaluated. The USASAT-COMA received field data from 14 AN/MSC-46 terminals and 12 AN/TSC-54 terminals over this period. The reporting system was jointly developed to get field data for these assessments. A prime consideration in gathering data was to keep the reporting system simple so that field personnel would be required only to perform minimum clerical work and make minimum interpretations of data. This paper considers the design objectives of both the AN/MSC-46 and the AN/MSC-46 and the AN/TSC-54 ground terminals and the assessment and growth of these systems in availability achievement after being deployed."
"Estimators for failure-law parameters are derived for the components of a series system under an attribute life test situation where the parameters of the failure laws are unequal. Exponential, Rayleigh, mixed exponential and Rayleigh, and a special case of the Weibull failure models are treated. An example uses simulated data for a 10-component system."
"It is often desirable to construct s-confidence limits for system reliability on the basis of data obtained from `pass-fail' tests on the components of the system. This paper presents a general method for sequentially testing the components that provides data from which these s-confidence limits can be easily derived. The method is applicable to any s-coherent system for which the reliability function is known. It is a generalization of a scheme given by Winterbottom and Verrall for systems composed of units arranged either in series or parallel."
 "Preventive maintenance and repair during a mission have an important effect on the dependability of ships' systems. Space and weight limitations mean that not all repairs can be carried out during the mission and this limits the dependability which can be achieved. Using a simple diesel generator arrangement as an example, this paper discusses the relationships between dependability, downtime for preventive maintenance, proportion of failures repairable at sea, and equipment failure rate."
"An exact and an approximate method for calculating the probability of occurrence of the output event from priority-AND (sequential) failure logic is given. The approximate method can be used during fault-tree analysis without modification to existing quantitative evaluation techniques. Assumptions made include s-independent, exponentially distributed, non-repairable basic events as input to the priority-AND failure logic."
 "This paper compares two approximation procedures with the implicit enumeration technique for solving reliability optimization problems. The integer nature of the problem is stressed and suggestions are made for evaluating future efforts to solve the problem."
  "An algorithm for optimum allocation of redundancies in a general system is presented. The method is applicable to problems having any number of constraints which need not be linear. For selecting the subsystem where redundancy is to be added, a heuristic criterion is introduced which takes into account the relative increment in reliability versus increments in constraints. The method is applicable for any system configuration where subsystems are composed of identical parallel elements. The algorithm is simple, requires little computation effort, and is easily programmed for a computer. An example of a nonseries system illustrates the procedure."
"Members of IEEE Reliability Group and ASQC Electronics Division can receive the following publications free of extra charge."
"This paper presents a mathematical model for computing the reliability of a system with redundant components in a tree configuration. This model is quite general and can be applied to any system representable by the appropriate tree. A typical example is cited. A computer program that computes reliability of a system with a tree configuration up to n stages is also presented in the Appendix."
 "This paper presents an algorithm for computing the reliability of a reducible network, viz., a network, which can be reduced by series or parallel calculations only. The network is successively reduced. The method minimizes computer storage and is fast, therefore it can handle large systems."
 "This paper extends Gnedenko's F (ratio) test for exponentiality to the 2-parameter Weibull distribution. When the shape parameter is known, a Weibull distribution can be reduced to an exponential by a suitable transformation, and then one can test the hypothesis that a given sample could have come from the specific Weibull population using the F procedure. However, when the true values of the parameters are not known, a technique for estimating these values must be selected before any goodness-of-fit test can be performed. We have selected various estimators for the shape, transformed accordingly, and then derived and tabulated critical values for Gnedenko's ratio statistic in each case. The key result is that the convergence-in-distribution of the test statistic to the F distribution is most rapid when the Menon estimator is used."
"An age replacement problem is considered taking account of costs for stock and system down. The stochastic behavior of this model is analyzed and the optimum age replacement policies are discussed."
 "One occasionally assumes that the mean duration of a hidden, i.e., not immediately self-reporting, fault is approximately half the time between consecutive checks. The precision of this approximation is investigated."
 "The axiomatic relationship between component quality control and reliability is explored analytically in this paper for a particular Quality Control procedure, and the effects on reliability of different versions of the procedure are quantified with the aid of simple examples. Theoretical relationships could similarly be developed for other quality control procedures. This could lead to an increased understanding of the relationship between quality control procedures and component reliability. These relationships could provide a theoretical basis for comparing different procedures, although the absolute values obtained may have no practical importance due to the well known difficulty involved in identifying probability distributions for component parameters."

"The theme of effective programming, begun in the previous issue, continues herein with three papers describing code inspections, composite design, and program dynamics."
"We can summarize the discussion of design and code inspections and process control in developing programs as follows: 1. Describe the program development process in terms of operations, and define exit criteria which must be satisfied for completion of each operation. 2. Separate the objectives of the inspection process operations to keep the inspection team focused on one objective at a time: Operation Overview Preparation Inspection Rework Follow-up Objective Communications/education Education Find errors Fix errors Ensure all fixes are applied correctly 3. Classify errors by type, and rank frequency of occurrence of types. Identify which types to spend most time looking for in the inspection. 4. Describe how to look for presence of error types. 5. Analyze inspection results and use for constant process improvement (until process averages are reached and then use for process control)."
"A summary and comparison of language attributes is given in Table 1. Of the six languages surveyed, PL/I and FORTRAN are best suited to composite design. COBOL is also well suited, provided that modules are represented as subprograms, and not as performed paragraphs. Composite design can be used with APL, although the APL problems discussed often cause undesirable compromises to be made. Composite design does not lend itself well to the design of RPG and ALGOL program: both lack the concept of a module, and RPG lacks the concept of arguments and parameters."
"Currently, the process of large-scale program development and maintenance appears to be unpredictable; its costs are high and its output is a fragile product. Clearly, one should try to reach beyond understanding and attempt to change the process for the better."
"In general, it can be said that there exists a large body of technical literature that covers a wide spectrum of problems related to the new and very important field of data base systems. There is no doubt that the relational data base approach provides a scientific foundation and a sound engineering discipline. In addition, it provides a theory for data analysis and data structuringa s well as a badly needed formalism in this highly significant area of computer science. A considerable literature has been generated by the very fact that the relational approach provides a scientific discipline in a field that has been governed by a haphazard approach for a long time. However, too many papers present concepts that may never go beyond the realm of academic interest. Despite the existence of some small-scale (experimental) implementations, additional evidence is needed to indicate the practicality and feasibility of such an approach in a large-scale data base environment."
 "We remain enthusiastic about the potential of virtual machine concepts and strongly recommend this approach. VM technology coupled with other technologies, namely, interactive data base systems and hierarchical system structuring have distinct comparative advantages for a broad class of problems, especially in decision support systems."
  "The papers in this issue describe four separate topics: a relational data-base system, the interactive modeling of computer systems, a method of monitoring service levels provided by a computer center, and a technique for using microcode to execute APL statements on a System/370 computer."
"A high-level data-base system, the Peterlee Relational Test Vehicle (PRTV), provides flexible, interactive data-base support and functional extensibility. The user sees the system primarily through a programming language called ISBL, which is designed for manipulating bulk data held in relations. PRTV is not a full-fledged data-base system, but rather an evolving prototype which is expected to aid in solving some of the problems that have been encountered in using relational data bases. PRTV embodies research both in data-base language design and in efficient implementation techniques."
"This paper provides a nontechnical introduction to queuing network concepts, a short introduction to results of research into analytical modeling methodology, and a set of simple but typical examples that illustrate the application of that methodology to problems of computer performance."
"Service levels represent an important concept that can be applied toward the solution of difficult problems surrounding communications between users and providers of data processing services. In this paper, this concept is described in terms of the architecture, which defines the scope and structure of service information. The paper further translates the architecture into data processing terminology by presenting the data-base structure and data elements related to service levels. The paper also addresses the post-processing of the data base, a step essential to properly communicating service-level information."
"Emulation of an APL machine on a System/370 is exemplified by the APL Assist, a microprogram that enables APL expressions and defined functions to be executed at the hardware level. This paper discusses what the APL Assist does, how it works, and the way it interacts with System/370 software. Execution times for APL programs with and without the Assist are compared."
   "Systems Network Architecture (SNA) provides a framework for combining hardware and software components into an efficient, coherent teleprocessing system. To put this architecture into an historical perspective, the first paper in this issue, by McFadyen, is an overview in which the functional layers of SNA are defined as follows: Transmission management controls the actual flow of traffic through the network; functional management controlts the format of information sent to and from the application layers; application consists of user application programs in the host computer and equivalent functions in other nodes."
"By relieving the user of network management concerns, Systems Network Architecture provides a flexible and extendible structure enabling multiple applications to share a single network. The SNA concepts encourage the distribution of information processing from computers to control units by establishing an environment that is independent of the physical configuration. In geographically dispersed networks, application programs and data bases can be moved from the host to another node closer to the terminal operator. Programmable control units can be optimized to allow persons with little or no data-processing training to utilize computers. The communication system formats and protocols enhance the exchange of information among a diverse group of operators, application programs, and devices. Application programs and devices designed to sNA specifications solve specific problems rather than being involved in the entire communications process. Network users can concentrate their resources on specific applications without understanding the increasingly complex information-processing systems that assist them in their work. CITED"
"In the data processing world of the future, communications requirements will become more complex and will involve many new application areas. These new applications will need to jointly use the system's communication resources (CPUs , teleprocessing facilities, and terminals) while the management of these resources will grow more complex. SNA provides the management of the communication system so that the end user of the system can develop and use applications, ignoring the system's complexity and sharing its resources with the other end users. SNA also provides the system structure that allows both conceptual and physical growth of the network in the future."
"The role of NCP/VS in an SNA environment has been examined from a vantage point within the network looking outward toward the host application programs and the terminal facilities. Data link control, path control, and connection point management work together to oversee the network traffic while maintaining separation of the SNA functional layers. The NCP physical unit services component cooperates with the system services control point in the host to govern operation of the physical resources associated with the NCP, as well as to oversee sophisticated testing and statistics recording. Thus, network functions are distributed amongst the host computer and the communications controllers throughout the network."
"Even before the advent of the Systems Network Architecture, there were strong motivations for a new teleprocessing access method. The introduction of VTAM provided both sharing of network resources and direct control of communications. VTAM also represented an optimization for the recent enhancements in CPU technology, e.g., dynamic address translation and multiprocessing. In conjunction with the queued control capabilities of TCAM, VTAM formed a base for consolidation and further enhancement of IBM'S communications facilities."
"This paper describes a system that demonstrates the feasibility and practicality of a hierarchical set of computers for real-time event-driven applications. The system currently is operational in a wide variety of environments and has been generally well received. When new functions are required, they have proved easy to include."
"The virtual machine architecture embodied in wm/370 greatly simplifies an operating system in most areas and hence increases the probability of correct implementation and resistance to penetration. The control program is not concerned with user files or multiple access methods. It simulates a machine with a fixed number of buttons and instructions that require interpretation. The choice of System/370 Principles of Operation as a user interface provides a well understood and well documented interface. The result is a system that is smaller and simpler, with fewer opportunities for error. The simplicity enhances the probability of obtaining security. The exception area is the support of input/output."
  "The transmission links between devices in a computer network may introduce significant errors because the links are analog, whereas computing devices are digital. Moreover, the design error rates for transmission links are often much higher than those tolerated for digital computing devices. Computer hardware and software have been designed to provide recovery when errors occur on communication lines. In the first paper in this issue, Bryant takes this process one step further by continuously monitoring the telephone lines used for data transmission. Line quality monitoring improves network availability by locating line problems before they become critical and by recording the causes of intermittent errors. Experiments at one installation show that use of this method greatly increased circuit availability."
"Data being carried by transmission links in computer networks are often subject to transmission errors resulting from various phenomena occurring on the transmission lines. This paper describes an experimental system for monitoring the quality of data transmission over common carrier leased lines and gives examples of how the information obtained from the system may be used in the daily operations of a computer center. The experiments have been carried out at several locations within IBM."
"The improvement of the system development process requires innovation in two areas: the development of a discipline that involves a set of structured techniques, and an understanding of the theories on which that discipline is based."
"The McDonnell Douglas Automation Company (MCAUTO™), which is a division of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, provides data processing services to the other divisions within the corporation as well as nationwide commercial data-processing services. Each division of McDonnell Douglas has its own systems analysts for business applications. The systems analysts determine user requirements and develop appropriate application system designs. Specifications for the system designs usually include a prose overview, descriptions of input and output files, screen layouts, report layouts, and logic specifications, MCAUTO personnel may assist the divisional analysis with the specifications or may develop the system designs. In either case, MCAUTO personnel are responsible for refining the system deisgn, program design as necessary, coding, testing, and writing documentation necessary for the operation and maintenance of the systems. Thus programmers in MCAUTO are presented with system specifications of varying levels of detail, in which any two systems may be defined at different levels of detail, especially with reference to program logic."
    "Impedance distance relaying for fault-protection of a plurality of high-voltage lines has not been accomplished with a minicomputer because of the burden of time placed upon these computers. A new method for computing impedance from data samples is proposed, which would employ only the computer operations of Add, Subtract, and Shift. This is valuable because these operations are one to two orders of magnitude faster on present day minicomputers than the operations of Multiply, Divide, Square, and Square Root. The new method is based upon the use of Walsh functions. When compared with the best competitive method, this new method shows superiority in speed and an accuracy that meets proposed objectives."
"Equilibrium behavior of a store-and-forward network node with finite buffer capacity is studied via a network-of-queues model. The positive acknowledgment protocol is explicitly modeled and consumes part of the buffer pool. The principal results are the buffer overflow probability, the mean delays, and the distribution of queue lengths as functions of the buffer capacity and traffic levels."
"The scheduling of a set of tasks, with precedence constraints and known execution times, into a set of identical processors is considered. Optimal scheduling of these tasks implies utilizing a minimum number of processors to satisfy a deadline, or finishing in minimal time using a fixed number of processors. This process can be seen as a transformation of the original graph into another graph, whose precedences do not violate the optimality constraints and has a unique basic schedule. Analysis of this transformation provides insight into the scheduling process and also into the determination of lower bounds on the number of processors and on time for optimal schedules."
"Sequel 2 is a relational data language that provides a consistent, English keyword-oriented set of facilities for query, data definition, data manipulation, and data control. Sequel 2 may be used either as a stand-alone interface for nonspecialists in data processing or as a data sublanguage embedded in a host programming language for use by application programmers and data base administrators. This paper describes SEQUEL 2 and the means by which it is coupled to a host language."
"In this paper, we discuss several aspects of data organization in the framework of a recently developed magnetic bubble memory technology known as a bubble lattice file. A dynamic ordering scheme, different from those implemented in conventional T-I bar bubble memories, is proposed. This ordering is particularly suited for bubble lattices. Some performance figures are included for comparison."
"A system of PL/I procedures has been written that permits geometric objects to be described hierarchically. The objects are themselves represented as PL/I procedures, allowing very general use of variables. By effectively intercepting subprogram calls, the system provides a means of modifying the semantics associated with any object without modifying the object's procedural description."
"A method is presented for determining the three-dimensional convex hull of a real object that is approximated in computer storage by a polyhedron. Essentially, this technique tests all point pairs of the polyhedron for convex edges of the convex hull and then assembles the edges into the polygonal boundaries of each of the faces of the convex hull. Various techniques for optimizing this process are discussed. A computer program has been written, and typical output shapes are illustrated. Finding the three-dimensional convex hull is approximately the same computer burden as eliminating hidden lines."

    "This paper describes and compares four research projects whose goal is to develop an automatic programming system that can carry on a natural language dialogue with a user about his requirements and then produce an appropriate program. It also discusses some of the important issues in this research area."
"Some of the arguments that have been given both for and against the use of natural languages in question-answering and programming systems are discussed. Several natural language based computer systems are considered in assessing the current level of system development. Finally, certain pervasive difficulties that have arisen in developing natural language based systems are identified, and the approach taken to overcome them in the REQUEST (Restricted English QUESTion-Answering) System is described."
"Request is an experimental Restricted English QUESTion-answering system that can analyze and answer a variety of English questions, spanning a significant range of syntactic complexity, with respect to a small Fortune-500-type data base. The long-range objective of this work is to explore the possibility of providing nonprogrammers with a convenient and powerful means of accessing information in formatted data bases without having to learn a formal query language. To address the somewhat conflicting requirements of understandability for the machine and maximum naturalness for the user, request uses a language processing approach featuring: 1) the use of restricted English; 2) a two-phase, complier-like organization; and 3) linguistic analysis based on a transformational grammar. The present paper explores the motivation for this approach in some detail and also describes the organization, operation, and current status of the system."
"A data base system that supports natural language queries is not really natural if it requires the user to know how the data are represented. This paper defines a formalism, called conceptual graphs, that can describe data according to the user's view and access data according to the system's view. In addition, the graphs can represent functional dependencies in the data base and support inferences and computations that are not explicit in the initial query."
"Parametric bicubic patch surfaces have been used for some time in manufacture and design. It is convenient to have such surfaces available as standard numerical control surfaces using the APT programming language. A major drawback is that they are costly to use for data processing of numerical control programs. If, however, nonparametric bicubics are used, computer time, and hence cost, can be reduced dramatically. This paper details a strategy and algorithms for this purpose. Experimental data suggest that computer costs are comparable to, or somewhat lower than, the costs for processing tabulated cylinder surfaces."
"The use of a regular array, or lattice, of magnetic bubbles for the storage of information requires two kinds of functions: the read-write functions involving the generation and discrimination of bubbles with different wall structures, and the access functions involving the insertion and removal of bubbles at selected locations in the lattice. In a column-accessed bubble lattice device, accessing is accomplished by first translating the lattice to position the desired column of bubbles in an input-output access channel and then translating this column along the channel to a detector area outside of the lattice while simultaneously introducing new bubbles from a generator area at the other end of the channel. An analysis of the influence of device design parameters on access rate indicates that the most important parameters are the column translation rate and lattice capacity. A device is described that was designed to study the translation of a lattice of bubbles and of a single column of bubbles within the lattice. Quasistatic operating margins and dynamic measurements of this test device indicate that the column-access configuration provides feasible means for the rapid access of bubbles from a lattice."
"A high-resolution technique is described for the experimental fabrication of Permalloy patterns for magnetic bubble circuits having linewidths as small as 3000 Å The system includes a computer-controlled electron beam, automatic registration, a modified field-stitching method, and exposure control to compensate for proximity effects. Patterns are formed either by electroplating or by evaporation. The system can be used either for directly writing on bubble wafers or for fabricating masks for x-ray or conformable-mask printing."
"An integral disk enclosure that incorporates a novel head-positioning actuator concept is used in the IBM System/32 and in recently announced terminal controllers, such as the Retail Store Controller and the Communication Controller. Based on a swinging arm rather than the conventional linear carriage, the actuator presented the designers with opportunities to create a simplified mechanism and to gain advantages in reliability and cost. This paper describes the geometrical, structural, and electromechanical basis of the design."
"The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be applied to circular arrays receiving wideband sonar radiation. As with conventional beamforming, the FFT serves in the first stage to divide the spectrum into narrow frequency bands. Then the array element responses of each band are analyzed in a second stage of FFTs for the Fourier components (modes) of the array excitation function for the respective band. Application of weights of the mode responses, to simulate the radiation efficiency of the modes for any given element radiation pattern and to control the array pattern, yields the Fourier components of the beam pattern. To integrate these Fourier components, inverse FFTs follow which yield as many beam pattern samples as there are array elements."
"It is found that the structure of amorphous Gd-Co films, as revealed by x-ray diffraction, is correlated with the magnitude of bias voltage present during the sputter deposition. Films sputter deposited with zero bias voltage typically show one broad peak in an x-ray diffraction spectrum, and films sputter deposited with −100 volts bias show two broad peaks with a shoulder between them. These structural differences appear to be related to the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in these films."

   "A generalization of cubic spline interpolation with vertical slopes at some knots is proposed. An existence theorem including an algorithm for constructing such generalized splines is proved. The resulting splines are obtained in closed form and they are partition invariant."
"This paper is concerned with the stochastic modeling of processor scheduling and of queuing due to contention for resources in data base management systems. The processing services rendered in searching the data base and retrieving and processing information are modeled explicitly, as is the algorithm used to schedule these services on the processor. The scheduling of the processor is based on a total priority ordering of a set of queues for processing service. A queuing model incorporating the processor scheduling algorithm for IMS (Information Management System) is formulated in order to illustrate the modeling ideas. The model is analyzed under rather general distributional assumptions, based on the observation that certain stochastic processes in the model are cumulative processes defined over the same embedded semi-Markov process. The model is not used in a performance study of IMS, nor is it proposed that the model developed here is one upon which a performance study of IMS should be undertaken. The model should be viewed as illustrative of stochastic models which can be constructed to incorporate algorithms for processor scheduling."
"An exploratory approach is taken to analyze a vast quantity of data recorded during the running of the data base management system IMS (Information Management System). The collection of data analyzed is a sequence of access path lengths for a day-long period. The number of segments accessed by IMS when searching a data base in order to retrieve a specified segment for a user is called an access path length. Part of the motivation for the analysis is to suggest reasonable stochastic models for the access path length sequence that can be conveniently utilized as input models for a stimulation model of an IMS installation. The exploratory approach taken to the data involves the use of graphical displays and simple numerical summaries to reveal characteristics of, and patterns in, the data. Some simple ways are presented in which the structure of the data revealed by the analysis can be incorporated into an input model for a system simulation."
"Central problems in the performance evaluation of computer systems are the description of the behavior of the system and characterization of the workload. One approach to these problems comprises the interactive combination of data-analytic procedures with probability modeling. This paper describes methods, both old and new, for the statistical analysis of non-stationary univariate stochastic point processes and sequences of positive random variables. Such processes are frequently encountered in computer systems. As an illustration of the methodology an analysis is given of the stochastic point process of transactions initiated in a running data base system. On the basis of the statistical analysis, a non-homogeneous Poisson process model for the transaction initiation process is postulated for periods of high system activity and found to be an adequate characterization of the data. For periods of lower system activity, the transaction initiation process has a complex structure, with more clustering evident. Overall models of this type have application to the validation of proposed data base subsystem models."
"This paper presents a methodology and a model for data conversion or translation. The model assumes that both source and target systems are available and that conversion interfaces may be required to interact between these systems and the conversion system. To achieve data conversion or translation using this approach, two languages are needed: 1) a language to describe the data structures, and 2) a language to specify the mapping between source and target data. This paper describes these two languages, DEFINE and CONVERT and gives numerous examples to show the capabilities of these languages and how they can be used in data conversion and restructuring. Both languages are high level and nonprocedural and have the power to deal with most situations encountered in data conversion processes. In addition, the paper also describes some of the facilities in the languages specifically designed for data checking in a data conversion process."
"Complex Mersenne Transforms are defined in a ring of integers modulo a Mersenne or pseudo-Mersenne number and can be computed without multiplications. It is shown that under certain conditions, these transforms can be computed by means of fast transform algorithms and permit the evaluation of digital convolutions with better efficiency and accuracy than does the Fast Fourier Transform."
"An access stream is the sequence of storage accesses made by an executing program; a merged stream results from the multi-programming of a number of individual access streams. Assuming that LRU (least recently used) miss ratio functions for individual streams are known, we consider the problem of predicting the LRU miss ratio function for merged streams. Each access stream is modeled as a sequence of independent, identically distributed LRU stack distances which evolves in time as a Poisson process and the merged stream is taken to be the superposition of these processes. For an arbitrary number of such streams, a closed form expression for the expected miss ratio function is obtained."
"Storage buffers are often used to hold temporary results or data that may be re-referenced in the near future. If these buffers are pagable, searching the buffer may cause a high number of page exceptions. A model of this phenomenon is postulated, and compared with experimental data."

   "Lorentz microscopy is used to study amorphous thin films of Gd-Co-Au and Gd-Co-Mo having a range of Q values. Stripe and bubble formation are shown as a function of perpendicular bias fields and pulsed or rotating in-plane fields. In the presence of an in-plane field, stripes contain a pair of Bloch lines and break into rows of Bloch-line containing bubbles. A unichiral stripe, however, forms a unichiral bubble that is stable to higher perpendicular bias fields than are Bloch-line bubbles. Bloch-line rotation in bubble walls in the presence of external rotating fields is demonstrated, and Bloch-line motion due to sweeping in-plane walls is shown. The rare occurrence of four Bloch lines in a 0.2-µm bubble is observed, as is the pearl-like accumulation of multiple Bloch lines in walls of irregularly shaped domains."
"We observe that periodic variations of bias field can couple to a close-packed lattice of magnetic bubbles to produce a steady rotation of the bubble lattice (RBL). Pulsed fields excite various other many-body phases as well. The physical motions of such bubble arrays can be described by “lattice melting,” “evaporation,” and “rotating galaxies.” The RBL phase is stable over wide ranges of pulse width and amplitude when the film is thick and the lattice is confined either by a circular ion-milled groove or by radially symmetric inhomogeneous fields from the excitation coil itself. Microsecond pulsed fields of −0.05 × 4πMs applied to a lattice of five-µm bubbles produce a net displacement of up to 1.5 µm/pulse at the rim of a lattice 23 bubbles across and 250 µm in diameter. Sinusoidal bias modulation in the range 1 to 30 MHz produces a spectrum of lattice rotational velocities vs frequency having both signs. At frequencies near the low end of the spectrum both the magnitude and the sign of the rotation are sensitive to drive amplitude. A tentative theory attributes lattice rotation to nonlinearities involving the bubble-deflection effect. The mechanism is strong enough to account for the observed magnitude of rotational frequency and can explain its resonant peaks and sign changes."
"A new storage structure, called a uniform ladder, consists of a linear array of equal shift-register loops, each holding one record and linked by flow-steering switches. Data exchange across a loop boundary is mandatory if the controlling switch is on and forbidden if off. For MRU (Most Recently Used) storage management, the most important operation is the climbing of data to the top of the ladder from a depth of D loops, which takes only (D + 1)/2 record periods in the uniform ladder. Program switching is enhanced by efficient schemes for partial environmental exchanges and also by internal block transfers. A pushdown stack can be efficiently implemented by a change in the record storing technique."
"Forces on a magnetic bubble due to abrupt asymmetric changes in the surface configuration of the magnetic film are investigated theoretically and experimentally. A model is derived for calculating the forces on a bubble as it is being moved by conductor propagation through a thickness gradient in the film. An experiment is described in which the forces necessary to move a bubble through this transition region are measured and compared with predicted values computed from the model. Results are presented for a 20° gradient with a cut 0.62 µm deep in a garnet film, nominally 3.8 µm thick, prepared by liquid phase epitaxy."
"Various authors (especially Scott, Egli, and Constable) have introduced concepts of “basis” for various classes of partially ordered sets (posets). This paper studies a basis concept directly analogous to the concept of a basis for a vector space. The new basis concept includes that of Egli and Constable as a special case, and one of their theorems is a corollary of our results. This paper also summarizes some previously reported but little known results of wide utility. For example, if every linearly ordered subset (chain) in a poset has a least upper bound (supremum), so does every directed subset. Given posets P and Q, it is often useful to construct maps g:P → Q that are chain-continuous: supremums of nonempty chains are preserved. Chain-continuity is analogous to topological continuity and is generally much more difficult to verify than isotonicity: the preservation of the order relation. This paper introduces the concept of an extension basis: a subset B of P such that any isotone f:B → Q has a unique chain-continuous extension g:P → Q Two characterizations of the chain-complete posets that have extension bases are obtained. These results are then applied to the problem of constructing an extension basis for the poset [P → Q] of chain-continuous maps from P to Q, given extension bases for P and Q. This is not always possible, but it becomes possible when a mild (and independently motivated) restriction is imposed on either P or Q. A lattice structure is not needed."
"Using a one-dimensional model, the author studied drop formation using a boundary value perturbation, rather than a spatially periodic one as considered by Rayleigh. The Rayleigh solution becomes the high jet velocity approximation to this linear analysis. At lower velocities the analysis shows that the medium becomes dispersive, and drop formation characteristics are quite different from that predicted by Rayleigh. In an appendix, the gross momentum balance and flow rate conservation are used to consider drop formation from a stream."
"A model for storage in procedural languages is presented. Its fundamental notion is to strictly distinguish values from storage objects. Several difficulties in current languages are resolved in this model, e. g., the problem of flexible locations and the meaning of the term type. In the light of the storage object/value dichotomy, several notions are found to be covered by the term type. The implications of the model are explored with respect to the more conventional data constructs of procedural languages as well as to sets and how they might be provided. Finally, data extension mechanisms are considered. Whereas the treatment here is not complete, the template concept introduced in the model does suggest a useful framework for providing the much talked of but seldom realized benefits of data extensibility."
"This paper addresses the problem of efficient forward error correction on differentially encoded, quadriphase-shift-keying (DQPSK) channels. The approach is to design codes to correct the most probable error patterns. First the probability distribution of error patterns is derived. Then a class of convolutional codes that correct any single two-bit error is described. Finally a threshold decodable code that corrects all single, and many double, two-bit errors is presented."
"This paper deals with the motor, the inertia ratio, and the power input requirements for moving an inertial load over a specified distance in a specified time. A linear speed-torque relationship is assumed, and selected motor parameters are normalized to the load to establish generally applicable solutions and characteristic curves. Emphasis is placed on the velocity-time diagrams and the relationship among the inertia ratio, the rated motor power, and the electrical input power. It is shown that optimization is possible for input power at stall, input power immediately following torque reversal, and average input power. Computer generated curves are presented for these three cases, and their relationships are discussed. Finally, it is shown that the motor time constant has a great influence on power requirements."

  "Algorithms for encoding and decoding finite strings over a finite alphabet are described. The coding operations are arithmetic involving rational numbers li as parameters such that ∑i2−li≤2−ε. This coding technique requires no blocking, and the per-symbol length of the encoded string approaches the associated entropy within ε. The coding speed is comparable to that of conventional coding methods."
"An analysis of the Berlekamp-Massey Linear Feedback Shift-Register (LFSR) Synthesis Algorithm is provided which shows that an input string of length n requires O(n2) multiplication/addition operations in the underlying field of definition. We also derive the length distribution for digit strings of length n. Results show that, on the average, the encoded length is no greater than n + 1 Furthermore, we exhibit a connection between step 1 of the Ling-Palermo algorithm and the LFSR Algorithm, and the LFSR Algorithm turns out to be computationally superior."
"The techniques of deep-ultraviolet (UV) conformable-contact photolithography are described and some preliminary work reported on their application to the fabrication of high-density bubble memory circuits by single-level masking. A quantitative analysis of tolerance requirements for linewidth, mask-to-wafer gap, and exposure is made for printing with conventional UV and deep-UV, for feature sizes in the range 2.5 µm to 0.1 µm. A new type of mask-to-wafer holder is described, utilizing a diaphragm to achieve contact. The holder can be used for either a conformable wafer or a conformable mask, or for both conformable wafer and mask, and for the liquid gap technique. Developmental bubble memory circuits on amorphous and garnet materials have been fabricated using deep-UV conformable-contact photolithography, electroplating, liftoff, and ion milling."
"Phonon dispersion curves, elastic constants, and the pV isotherms are calculated for solid Xe and Kr at 0 K using quasiharmonic lattice dynamics derived from multiparameter pair potentials. The computations account for the Axilrod-Teller-Muto three-body triple-dipole forces that arise in third-order perturbation theory. Approximate allowance is also made for anharmonic effects and, in the case of Xe, for three-body, third-order, dipole-quadrupole interactions and the three-body dipole interactions that arise in fourth-order perturbation theory. The over-all agreement with experimental phonon data is good except, in the case of xenon, for the lowest-energy phonons in the [110] direction. This has the consequence that the shear elastic constant (C11 − C12)/2 and the zero temperature Debye theta are somewhat lower than current experimental values."
"This paper describes an analytical technique for quantifying and modeling the frequency of occurrence of integrated circuit failures. The method is based on the analysis of random and clustered defects on wafers with defect monitors. Results from pilot line data of photolithographic defects, insulator short circuits, and leaky pn junctions are presented to support the practicality of the approach. It is shown that, although part of the yield losses are due to the clustering of defects, most product loss is from random failures. The yield model shows good agreement with actual product yields."
"An efficient method for control of stepping motor speed and position, the delayed closed-loop (DCL) mode, is described. The new technique permits control of high-speed motor motion by means of a programmed speed-displacement characteristic. The method combines the static-speed control characteristic of the open-loop mode with the stable dynamic behavior of the closed-loop mode. Unlike other schemes for delayed closed-loop control, the present configuration features an extension of delay time to more than one step duration, significantly improving the velocity control. The phase angle can also be varied to ±180°, permitting adequate control of deceleration as well as acceleration. A stability analysis is made of the DCL control method. In an illustrative example, the technique is applied to control of the carriage drive on an experimental high-speed line printer."
"This paper examines optimization within a relational data base system. It considers the optimization of a single query defined by an expression of the relational algebra. The expression is transformed into an equivalent expression or sequence of expressions that cost less to evaluate. Alternative transformations, and combinations of several transformations, are analyzed. Measurements on an experimental data base showed improvements, especially in cases where the original expression would be impracticably slow in its execution. A small overhead was incurred, which would be negligible for large data bases."
"Measurements of jet velocity, separation length, and stream stability (freedom from random fluctuations in drop position) were made for several fluids, including two inks. The data were then compared with modified fluid flow and jet stability equations. In one case velocity is related to applied pressure drop through a flow equation that depends primarily on the shape and size of the nozzle and on fluid viscosity. In the other case Weber's equation is modified to include forced oscillation, so that separation length is related to the voltage applied to a piezoelectric crystal, to disturbance growth rate, and to velocity. These two equations were applicable to “normal” liquids (those having good stream stability) having viscosities between 0.9 and 4.3 grams/(second · meter) and dynamic surface tensions between 20 and 60 grams/s2, but not to dilute solutions of a high molecular weight polymer, owing to their viscoelastic character. Furthermore, the stream stability of the polymer solutions was poor and depended inversely on concentration and molecular weight."
"A review and critique is made of those material and processing issues that pertain to the implementation of micrometer and submicrometer bubble devices on amorphous films. Adequate reproducibility and uniformity have been achieved in ternary amorphous films prepared by rf sputtering and their magnetic characteristics are very similar to those of analogous garnet films. Factors that may limit application to the amorphous films include defects and dielectric breakdown in insulating layers, sensitivity to annealing, and larger, but not prohibitive, coercivities. A salient problem common to both garnet and amorphous materials is attainment of sufficiently large values of Q to ensure stable device operation."
"An approach is described for computing complex convolutions modulo a Fermat number. It is shown that this technique is particularly efficient when the complex convolution is computed by means of Fermat Number Transforms and leads to improved implementation of complex digital filters."
"An optical facility is described for the study of the vibrational behavior of engineering test pieces. Time-average holography and electronic speckle pattern methods of analysis are combined into one system. The speckle pattern method is used for the identification of resonances, frequency tuning, and object alignment, thereby optimizing the number of holographic exposures. An evaluation is made of the electronic speckle pattern method for the detection of vibration modes of three-dimensional objects. The method is shown to detect resonant vibration readily on object faces inclined at angles up to 60° to the viewing direction."
"The examples shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of [1] illustrate the existence of simple cycles in the data model between the department and the manager of each case. Such relations, which are cyclic on a one-to-one basis, are frequent, both in the conceptual construction of data models by users and in the implementation of a data base for multi-file systems. To indicate this simple equivalency, the relation (D, M) can be replaced by an equivalent single domain, say X . Because of the frequency of occurrence of binary one-to-one relations, I have termed such relations a lexicon [2]. On applying this simplification, the result of the analysis for minimum cover given in [1] is a single set of relations as follows: R1(E, X, JC) R2 (X, CT) X(D, M)."

    "The successful completion of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) in July 1975 marked the end of NASA's Saturn program and the closing of a period in which the interaction between man and technology has contributed to some of the most spectacular achievements in modem history. It would be difficult to attach a figure of merit to the contribution of digital data processing to the total space program; however, there is no doubt that its role was significant over a broad spectrum of activities."
"Since the earliest days of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the American space program has been dependent on the data processing industry. Without the computer, there would have been no space program and, likewise, without the space program the main technological forces driving the computer industry forward would have been missing."
"This paper describes the functions, characteristics, requirements, and design approaches of the on-board computers for seven space vehicles—Saturn I, Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, Gemini, Saturn IB, Saturn V, Skylab, and Space Shuttle. The data contained in this paper represent an encapsulation of sixteen years of space-borne-computer development. In addition, the evolution of computer characteristics such as size, weight, power consumption, computing speed, memory capacity, technology, architectural features, software, and fault-tolerant capabilities, is summarized and analyzed to point out the design trends and the motivating causes. The evolution in utilization of the on-board computers; their interface with sensors, displays, and controls; and their interaction with operators are summarized and analyzed to show the increasing role played by computers in the overall space-vehicle system."
"This paper describes how a set of off-the-shelf general purpose digital computers is being managed in a redundant avionic configuration while performing flight-critical functions for the Space Shuttle. The description covers the architecture of the redundant computer set, associated redundancy design requirements, and the technique used to detect a failed computer and to identify this failure on-board to the crew. Significant redundancy management requirements consist of imposing a total failure coverage on all flight-critical functions, when more than two redundant computers are operating in flight, and a maximum failure coverage for limited storage and processing time, when only two are operating. The basic design technique consists of using dedicated redundancy management hardware and software to allow each computer to judge the “health” of the others by comparing computer outputs and to “vote” on the judgments. In formulating the design, hardware simplicity, operational flexibility, and minimum computer resource utilization were used as criteria."
"A technique is presented for constructing a mathematical model of an Earth resources remote sensor. The technique combines established models of electronic and optical components with formulated models of scan and vibration effects, and it includes a model of the radiation effects of the Earth's atmosphere. The resulting composite model is useful for predicting in-flight sensor performance, and a descriptive set of performance parameters is derived in terms of the model. A method is outlined for validating the model for each sensor of interest. The validation for one airborne infrared scanning system is accomplished in part by a satisfactory comparison of predicted response with laboratory data for that sensor."
"This paper describes digital image processing techniques that were developed to precisely correct Landsat multispectral Earth observation data and gives illustrations of the results achieved, e.g., geometric corrections with an error of less than one picture element, a relative error of one-fourth picture element, and no radiometric error effect. Techniques for enhancing the sensor data, digitally mosaicking multiple scenes, and extracting information are also illustrated."
 "The attitude stabilization and control system for Skylab evolved from an analog controller into a fully digital processing system. Features of this system include a software-determined attitude reference to provide general maneuvering ability, an in-orbit programming capability, the use of large control moment gyros for attitude control, and the use of vehicle maneuvers to desaturate gyro momentum. The objectives, requirements, and implementations of the control system software are described, along with the rationales for certain design decisions and discussion of some system dynamics and actual performance."
"The Large Space Telescope, which is scheduled to be put into orbit above the Earth's atmosphere by NASA in the early 1980s, is a large, multipurpose optical instrument that is being designed to provide an increase in observational capability of nearly 100×. with respect to brightness, 10× in resolving power, and a substantial bandwidth improvement over ground-based facilities. This paper describes, from a functional performance viewpoint, the LST system and, in greater detail, the on-board Data Management and Pointing Control Systems."
"This paper presents a functional description of the Launch Processing System, which provides automatic ground checkout and control of the Space Shuttle launch site and airborne systems, with emphasis placed on the Checkout, Control, and Monitor Subsystem. Hardware and software modular design concepts for the distributed computer system are reviewed relative to performing system tests, launch operations control, and status monitoring during ground operations. The communication network design, which uses a Common Data Buffer interface to all computers to allow computer-to-computer communication, is discussed in detail."
"This paper describes a real-time abort guidance algorithm which determines the time sequence of the powered maneuvers and the orientation of the thrust vector throughout an abort-mission action initiated during the orbiter ascent phase. It involves guiding a heavily loaded Space Shuttle vehicle, passing through severe environmental conditions, back to a designated landing area. A graphical example and estimates of the computer requirements are included."

  "Long-range research and development (R&D) planning must evaluate and compare programs with diverse objectives and uncertain outcomes, yielding multidimensional benefits and costs over many years. The relevance of several approaches in system theory to these considerations is discussed. Among those approaches are multiattribute utility analysis, decision analysis, time and state dependent preference analysis, portfolio selection, Paretian analysis, and interpretive structural modeling. A tentative procedure is outlined that integrates most of these approaches into one comprehensive methodology for R&D planning. National energy R&D strategic planning is taken as an example. In this methodology, a stochastic model of each R&D program is used to project its consequences in terms of improved future technology, as evaluated on several dimensions. A key feature of the approach is the evaluation of each new technology within the economic and technological context of the years of its deployment and use. Some aspects of implementation of the methodology are considered."
"The problem of interconnecting two multilevel subsystem models defined by binary matrices A and B and a common, transitive, contextual relation to form a system model defined by matrix M is solved. The entries of the unknown interconnection matrices X and Y are shown to form a multilevel implication structure. A method for finding this structure is given. The implication matrix that defines the structure furnishes a simple means of determining the inference opportunity of any unknown in X or Y at any point in the development of these matrices. Transitive bordering of A corresponds to the special case B = 1. When the system has many elements, it may be advisable to form a matrix A for a subset and then use transitive bordering iteratively to complete the structuring process."
"Limit-cycle oscillations of two models of the triceps surae muscle stretch reflex system are analyzed, using previously derived criteria for single sign integral pulse frequency modulated (SSIPFM) control systems. The muscle spindle (MS) is assumed to function as an SSIPFM encoder. The system's stability and error correction ability are studied using the SSIPFM model together with published physiological data. It is shown that the loop gain, which in the model represents the decerebrate preparation, is close to the instability value, despite its relatively small magnitude. This observation and the steady-state error of the model concur with physiological phenomena of decerebrate preparations. In accordance with the adaptive control systems model in which the parameters can be modified, a simple pole is added at the origin of the forward transfer function for improved system performance. The new model is analyzed, and it is shown that higher gains are attainable without limit cycle oscillations and with improved steady-state error. A sensitivity study of the influence of system parameter variation on stability is carried out for both systems."
"A method of data analysis which aims at the detection of the significant periodicities as well as of the irregular high frequency oscillations (perturbations) in biological time series (TS) is proposed. The significant frequency modes are detected by application of a statistical significance criterion on the periodogram derived from the given TS; they are used to construct the significant periodic series. The latter is then subtracted from the original TS in order to obtain the detrended TS defined as the perturbation series which is considered as the outcome of a stochastic process. Under the assumption of Gaussian characteristics for the stochastic process, evidence of which is available, a probabilistic basis for both univariate and bivariate analysis is provided. A ``surprisal'' measure defined as the reciprocal of the probability for an outcome of a stochastic process (or a pair of correlated porcesses) is introduced to account for both the average as well as the localized perturbation of the TS (or the correlation between the pair of TS). A dependence tree configuration that maximizes the overall mutual information or dependence among branches is proposed as an optimal representation of a multivariate system. Lag-correlation analysis and cospectrum tests are adopted for validation and modification of the configuration generated. Simulated systems are employed to test the extent of linear approximation of various nonlinear functions as well as the sensitivity of the proposed method when the simulated system is subject to disturbances of varied type and degree."
"The convergence of statistical (random) search for the minimization of an arbitrary multimodal functional Q(w) is dealt with by using the theorems of convergence of random processes of Braverman and Rozonoer. It is shown that random search can be regarded as a gradient algorithm in the Q-domain. Using this gradient to define the minimum of the functional, the convergence to this minimum is discussed at length. The theorems proved in this paper apply as well to discrete as to continuous optimization problems and as such, the developed technique is competitive with stochastic automata with a variable structure. The optimality of the scheme follows from the convergence in probability of the average performance to the minimum. The freedom in the organization of the search within the boundaries outlined by the conditions of convergence is emphasized. Finally, it is pointed out how various mixed random search and hierarchical search systems fall into the domain of application of the theorems."
"It is argued that a principle of casuality is fundamental to human thinking, and it has been observed experimentally that this assumption leads to complex hypothesis formation by human subjects attempting to solve comparatively simple problems involving acausal randomly generated events. This correspondence provides an automatatheoretic explanation of this phenomenon by analyzing the performance of an optimal modeler observing the behavior of a system and forming a minimal-state model of it."

"The ``pairing function'' concept applied to digital area correlation is described. One standard and three synthesized correlation functions are expressed in terms of the pairing functions Nij. The Nij are also random variables with easily calculated expected values Nij. The Nij are used to calculate ``background levels'' and detection thresholds, and using signal-to-noise ratios as the criteria, the three synthesized correlation functions yield better results than the standard one."

 "A method is developed for providing the optimal feedback gain matrix for high-order linear quadratic problems by a decentralized computational procedure. All the calculations in this approach are done off-line. The resulting gains are optimal for all initial conditions so that the eventual on-line computation is minimal. The method is applicable to both the regulator and the servomechanism problems and is particularly attractive to use for the infinite time case where even the off-line computation is small. A 22nd-order numerical example is used to illustrate the approach. The system here is the practical one of river pollution control based on some data from the river Cam near Cambridge, England. For this case, the optimal feedback matrix is calculated using the new approach."
"The structure of n-dimensional information theory is well adapted to the study of complex systems of many parts interacting in a nonsimple way, since it allows quantifications of the degree to which the parts are interdependent, i.e., are in communication with each other. It is particularly well suited to hierarchical systems. Even when calculations are impossible, informal interpretations of informational equations shed interesting light on the behavior of systems. These informal interpretations are emphasized. It is shown that the requirements on a system for selection of appropriate information (and therefore blockage of irrelevant information), internal coordination of parts, and throughput are essentially additive and therefore compete for the computational resources of the system. This observation has implications for system architecture. It is shown that under certain assumptions (valid, for example, for networks of parallel processors) systems are constraintlosing as well as information-losing. The importance and usefulness of the loss of information by a system is discussed briefly."
"Multiclass pattern recognition systems based on independently designed subrecognition systems (MURISS) are presented. Each subrecognition system is essentially a dichotomizer. As the models of MURISS we discuss MURIDDS (Multiclass pattern recognition system based on independently designed dual class recognition systems) and MURICS (Multiclass pattern recognition system based on independent classwise recognition systems). The performance of these systems is specified with respect to the total error and the rejection probabilities. For these probabilities we derive upper bounds which are composed of the error probabilities of subrecognition systems. These upper bounds yield a theoretical validity of MURIDDS and MURICS since the minimization of subsystem error probabilities will minimize the upper bound for the sum of the total error and the rejection probabilities. In order to illustrate the importance of MURIDDS and MURICS, we present several examples and the results of computer simulation."
"Three standard approaches to automatic texture classification make use of features based on the Fourier power spectrum, on second-order gray level statistics, and on first-order statistics of gray level differences, respectively. Feature sets of these types, all designed analogously, were used to classify two sets of terrain samples. It was found that the Fourier features generally performed more poorly, while the other feature sets all performned comparably."
"Real-time performance data was collected during a pick-up task carried out with a Rancho master-slave manipulator using a minicomputer-based data taker. Motions on all seven master and all seven slave joints as well as instantaneous electrical power consumed were continuously monitored. In addition to the usual task-time measurements, computer algorithms to integrate the energy consumed and to count and time the number of moves were implemented. In addition to these measures, several derived measures such as the fraction of time moving (MRATIO) and mean time per move (MBAR) were obtained in an off-line analysis. A major goal of these experiments is to compare the seven different measures of performance to determine which are best for evaluating particular experimental conditions. Preliminary results of the time delay experiment indicate that two new measures, MRATIO and MBAR, are almost an order of magnitude more sensitive than task time, the conventional measure, in determining performances changes with transmission delays in the range from 0.0 to 1.0s. Taking advantage of the operator's move-and-wait strategy, we also show how the energy consumed in carrying out a task can be reduced by a factor of three in the one-second transmission-delay case."
"Generalized nonlinear dynamic models of bistate ecological processes and the feasibility of obtaining closed-form analytical solutions to their governing differential equations represent the topic of this study. The model considered here permits arbitrary nonlinearities within certain very broad limitations, and consequently the study can be of value in modeling and analysis of bistate processes with complex inherent non-linearities in their behavior. The methodology is illustrated by considering as an example a class of these processes wherein the populations of both the species are in the same mode of growth or decay at any given instant. Exact closed-form solutions for the dynamics of a particular process belonging to this class are derived analytically. The resulting responses are discussed to bring out the behavior of the process in all its complexity and thereby demonstrate the value of this technique as an analytical tool in the study of a wide spectrum of nonlinear, bistate, socioecological processes. Also, it is shown that the scope of this study can be enlarged further to cover classes of processes with time-dependent properties as well."
"A method of solving a version of the two-dimensional cutting-stock problem is presented. In this version of the problem one is given a number of rectangular sheets and an order for a specified number of each of certain types of rectangular shapes. The goal is to cut the shapes out of the sheets in such a way as to minimize the waste. However, in many practical applications computation time is also an important economic consideration. For such applications the goal may be to obtain the best solution possible without using excessive amounts of computation time. The method of solution described here avoids exhaustive search procedures by employing an approach utilizing a constrained dynamic programming algorithm to lay out groups of rectangles called strips. This paper also describes the results obtained when the algorithm was tested with some typical rectangular layout problems."
"Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in systems design. This paper presents a unified simulation approach to the evaluation of two telephone switchboard systems using such techniques. Since technical competence and user satisfaction are equally important for an overall system success, this approach not only provides system designers with a means to obtain an insight into the expected efficiency of a new system, but it also helps to identify some potential human factors parameters that need to be carefully investigated early in the design stage. Hence, it does appear that further development and application of these techniques would serve to aid human factors studies in complex systems design. On a cost-effectiveness basis, programming effort and computer cost for this study are relatively insignificant."
"An alternative solution to the problem of the selection of the best strategy in a random environment is presented by using a probabilistic search procedure. The asymptotic optimality of the technique is proved, and a brief comparison with stochastic automata with variable structures is made. A specific organization of the optimal search procedure is developed based on continued learning of some statistics of the random environment, and it is shown to be fast-converging, powerful in high noise random environments, and insensitive to search parameter selection."
"Internal migration tables can be employed to ascertain functional migration regions-collections of geographic units with relatively large intraregional flows and relatively small interregional movements. A two-stage algorithm that has been utilized to study tables for various nations is applied here to a 21 × 21 French matrix. In the first step, the square table is adjusted to possess uniform marginal (row and column) sums. The doubly standardized table obtained can be regarded as an asymmetric similarity matrix. It serves, in the second stage, as input to a hierarchical clustering procedure, based on the concep of the strong components of a directed graph. Région Parisienne and Centre are shown to have the broadest migration bases. Well-defined southern and northwestern regions are found."
"Among the simplest and most intuitively appealing classes of nonprobabilistic classification procedures are those that weight the evidence of nearby sample observations most heavily. More specifically, one might wish to weight the evidence of a neighbor close to an unclassified observation more heavily than the evidence of another neighbor which is at a greater distance from the unclassified observation. One such classification rule is described which makes use of a neighbor weighting function for the purpose of assigning a class to an unclassified sample. The admissibility of such a rule is also considered."

 "An interdisciplinary research program of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, has investigated the potential impact of substituting telecommunications and computer technology for certain forms of urban transportation [1]. Emphasis has been placed upon the use of these technologies to alleviate the massive twice-daily peak commuting loads imposed upon most major American cities. The primary means by which these technologies will be used is to allow \"information industry\" workers to perform their jobs at work centers scattered throughout each city, close to their homes, rather than commuting long distances to work. A basic premise is made that this reorientation of urban work patterns will not occur unless the technological substitutes can be shown to be both economical and effective. The results of a study of a major insurance firm located in the Los Angeles central business district are presented. The study evaluated the present transportation patterns, population distribution, and business contact requirements of a major administrative division of this firm. These commuting and communicating patterns were then used as the basis for assessing the feasibility of the use of various levels of telecommunications and computer technology for allowing the substitution for commuting by \"telecommuting.\" Alternative telecommuting network designs were formulated and evaluated with respect to their ability to facilitate current work functions. Costs of network installation and operation were compared with the present costs of commuting. It is concluded that present communications and computer technology, in terms of \"off-the-shelf\" hardware and services, can offer an economical substitute for commuting."
"A model for the human observer in failure detection tasks is proposed which consists of two stages: a linear estimator and a decision mechanism. The estimator is a Kalman filter, and the decision mechanism, which is based on Wald's sequential analysis, leads to a decision function which is the integration of the filter residuals. The final result is a simple detection system which depends on only three parameters, and the sensitivity of the model to these parameters is analyzed. The results of an experiment designed to test the validity of the model are reported. The question of open and closed decision intervals as well as the generalization of the model to more complicated cases is discussed."
"A systems model is proposed to relate a profile of athletic performance to a profile of training. The general model assumes that performance has four components: endurance, strength, skill, and psychological factors. Each of these factors is discussed and ascribed a transfer function. A major problem is the quantification of both training and performance. The case of a swimmer is studied in detail. It is shown that if a time series of training impulses is used as input, his performance in 100 m criterion performances can be modeled rather well with a simple linear system. The major conclusion is that performance appears to be related to the difference between fitness and fatigue functions. The fitness function is related to training by a first-order system with time constant 50 days, whereas the fatigue function is related to training by a similar system with time constant 15 days. An appendix is provided to show how these systems can be simulated on a simple electronic calculator. The relationship of these relatively short-term efects on the individual performer (six months) to longer term effects on the same indiviudal is also discussed."
"Frequency response of standing humans subjected to sinusoidal vibration is presented. The vibratory input was a vertical displacement to the feet, and the output was the corresponding vertical response of the head. Twelve subjects (eight male and four female) were tested in the frequency range of 1-50 Hertz (Hz) with small input amplitudes (0.003 to 0.02 in). The twelve experimentally obtained frequency response plots were averaged and a sixteen-mass linear lumped-parameter model was developed to match the average response in both magnitude and phase angle. This proposed matching model is analogous to human anatomy. Parametric values of mass distribution and joint stiffnesses available in the literature were incorporated in the model. Damping parameters for various joints in the human body were indirectly determined from this study."
"A pattern recognition system is described which is capable of identifying human faces from their full profile silhouettes. Each silhouette is preprocessed to remove noise, smooth edges, and extract the front edge. The processed silhouettes are then represented by a 12-dimensional feature vector, the components of which are obtained by a circular autocorrelation function. Using a weighted k-nearest neighbor decision rule it is shown that a recognition accuracy of 90 percent is attainable in a ten-class problem. An adaptive training procedure is also described which is used for setting up the authority files. This training procedure appears to identify those feature vectors representing a class which are either most important, from an information content point of view, or are observed most often. Finally, a comparison is made between the recognition accuracy obtained using circular autocorrelation features and moment invariant features. It is shown that the former outperforms, in this problem, the latter. The system is also compared to human observers with the result that the system performs no worse than the human observers."
"A modification of the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) rule is presented in which classification is made not according to the ``majority vote'' but rather an integer threshold k1 (k1-NN rule). It is shown that while k-NN approximates the minimum expected error rule, k1-NN approximates the minimum expected risk rule with a threshold t. The relationship between t and values of k and k1 is derived. Several practical methods of using k1-NN for minimum expected risk classification and for classification with a reject option are described and illustrated with examples."
"Several models for line detection in noise are discussed, based on models for the ``simple'' and ``complex'' cells that have been found in the visual cortex. The possibility of obtaining experimental evidence for deciding among the models is briefly considered."
"A terminal/time share system for operator interactive left ventricular volume estimation is described. The system concept could provide a cost effective alternative to comparable minicomputer based methods and a potential for software resource sharing among several geographically remote users."
"Computer image processing techniques have been applied to particle counting and sizing in electron microscope images. Distributions of particle sizes were computed for several images and compared to manually computed distributions. The results of these experiments indicate that automatic particle counting within a reasonable error and computer processing time is feasible. The significance of the results is that the tedious task of manually counting a large number of particles can be eliminated while still providing the scientist with accurate results."
"Some experiments on the recognition of handwritten numerals are reported. A device affording real-time recognition, independent of the constraints usually required of the writer, has been used. The procedure implemented is also described."
"An algorithm for automatic recognition of handwritten capital letters is described in terms of formal grammars. The formalism is used for a priori computer time and memory optimization. Moreover, the syntactic recognition scheme is extended by introducing the concept of fuzzy sets instead of the usual probabilistic approach."
"CADSYS is an interactive computer-aided decision support system which interfaces a designer with a mathematical, rather than graphic, model of a design problem. Multiple design goals can be imposed in the form of equality and inequality constraints, whose levels can be manipulated. A numerical search is used to find designs which meet the constraints. CADSYS has now been applied to two real and current design problems: the hydraulic system of a novel inertial navigation unit and the financial, technical, and logistical problem of liquified natural gas tanker design and operation. Both of these studies returned new understanding of the problems themselves and of the capabilities of CADSYS."

  "Two strategies for regional development are analyzed: one with an emphasis on public investment in the region's infrastructure and the other with an emphasis on public investment in education and training, A growth model is presented which includes the effects of these public investment policy variables on productivity, private investment, and migration. Alternative public investment strategies are evaluated using a social welfare function. Optimization results indicate that a heavy emphasis on education and training is a better strategy, at least for the specific problem considered. The sensitivity of the policy variables is investigated with respect to model parameter values, the region's initial state, the tradeoff weights in the social welfare function, and the assumption that key model parameters are nonrandom. Assuming that a parameter is random implies the result that public investment in infrastructure should be slightly increased from a low nominal level."
"The methodology of discrete time, extended Kalman filtering is applied to the problem of identifying parameters of a macroscopic freeway traffic model. Macroscopic models provide a representation of traffic flow in terms of its gross properties, i.e., volume, density, and speed. The local identifiability of a parameterization of macroscopic model at nominal values of the unknown parameters is checked before any identification is attempted. It is shown that the parameterization is locally identifiable. Two parameters of the model (reaction time and sensitivity to changing density) were identified through the use of this methodology. The data base for studies to date was generated from a microscopic simulation of freeway traffic, which involves following all individual vehicle movements. Techniques for extending the methodology to employ real freeway traffic data, especially as can be obtained from automated surveillance systems, are discussed."
"Significant advances have been made over the past decade in the development of powerful function minimization methods. Although the essential structure of each of these methods is fixed, several auxiliary features invariably remain to be selected by the user in any actual implementation. The effectiveness of the methods can, furthermore, be greatly influenced by the choice made by the user in this regard. The sensitivity of a variety of different methods to three of these features is examined through a series of computational experiments. These features are 1) the type of gradient information used (exact or approximated), 2) the precision requested in the solution of the line search subproblem, and 3) the superposition, on the basic algorithm, of a policy of periodic reinitialization."
"A control theoretic model of an automobile driver's performance while negotiating a rural intersection is discussed. The model parameterizes vehicle response data in a manner which can be used to aid in categorizing variations in response observed across intersections. The data so obtained can be interpreted as being influenced by roadway geometrics and the driver's objectives. Results obtained using data collected with test drivers in an instrumented vehicle in actual driving situations are discussed."
"The validity of the criterion considered by Burns and Malone in applying optimization techniques to the Forrester model of the world is questioned. An alternative approach is suggested."
"The utility of optimizing models of social systems is examined, using Forrester's world model as an example. One ``optimal'' policy set was tested for its sensitivity to uncertainties in the formulation of both the model assumptions and an assumed long-term objective function. It is shown that the normal uncertainties associated with social system modeling make the search for an optimal policy unwarranted. The inaccuracies inherent in the assumptions of long-term social system models allow the modeler to explore with confidence only the general dynamic characteristics of the modeled system."
"It is argued that deterministic models of social values are just as valid as deterministic models of social processes. The appropriateness of using deterministic optimization techniques in conjunction with deterministic models of social values and processes is defended on the basis of its expediency as an analytic tool which contributes to an understanding of 1) the model and 2) strategies for controlling that model. The entire process of building models of social processes and using them to test the implications of operations approximations of various value systems is perceived as a supplement to, not a replacement for, more conventional intuitive or hueristic approaches for dealing with social systems."
"Six airline pilots participated in a fixed-base simulator experiment designed to study the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating a simple horizontal flight path predictor on both fixed and rotating electronic CRT map displays. The pilots were asked to fly a modified ``figure eight'' ground track (similar to right and left procedure turns in sequence) while attempting to maintain constant altitude. The dynamics were representative of a transport aircraft. All flight information was displayed on one 17-in (43-cm) CRT monitor. The controlled variables were 1) map orientation, 2) pilots, 3) presence or absence of crosswinds, 4) presence or absence of wind gusts, and 5) presence or absence of predictor. Error scores were recorded as deviations from the commanded ground track and altitude. Pilot comments and ratings were also obtained. No interaction in performance scores was found between the predictor and the two different map display orientations. It was found that the predictor reduced deviations from the commanded ground track, narrowed performance differences among pilots, narrowed the error differences found with and without crosswinds, and decreased pilot workload."
"In this correspondence, we are concerned with an algorithm used to find the set of all inexact prime implicants of an inexact switching function as defined with the help of fuzzy algebra. The principal advantage claimed over existing methods is that it is suitable for an efficient computer implementation. The steps are easy to apply and well adapted to being programmed without any heuristic methods."
"Four subjects solved problems on line with the Lincoln Laboratory Reckoner. Controlled delays were interposed between output commands and the resulting outputs, which were via typewriter, cathoderay tube (CRT), or line printer; other commands were executed promptly and without reply. The mean delay was 1, 4, 16, or 64 s, with individual delays varying widely and unpredictably about the mean. Data on nine problems per delay per subject showed that at longer delays the rate at which commands were given decreased, especially the rate of output commands, and that the problems were solved with fewer outputs in about the same time. With two subjects, there was a marked effect of delay on the relative frequency of use of the three output devices."
"A class of nonlinear learning algorithms for the Q-and S-model stochastic automaton-random environment setup are described. Necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute expediency of these algorithms are derived. Various algorithms that are so far reported in literature can be obtained as special cases of the general algorithm given in this correspondence."

"One of the main reasons for developing MOSFET technologies in the sixties has been the relative simplicity of the process leading to a lower cost per gate and allowing entrance to the medium scale level of integration (MSI). The first technology to enter high volume production has been the aluminium gate P channel MOSFET technology followed by the silicon gate process.."
"Recent advance in silicon on sapphire technology (SOS) is quite significant, and several applications of SOS devices have been already practically realized as a 1024 bit CMOS/SOS random access memory, a programmable logic array, a nonvolatile memory etc. The primary difficulties of the SOS structure, such as obtaining the epitaxial silicon films with acceptable electrical characteristics and with reasonably good crystal perfection, seem to be solved from the practical point of view for fabrication of MOS transistors on SOS wafer. Basic superiority of. the SOS structure compared with the bulk silicon structure has been confirmed through the high density CMOS LSI without any parasitic bipolar transistor effects between n-channel and p-channel transistors, and n-channel MOS LSI with higher speed due to decrease in parasitic capacitance of interconnections of both diffused layers and aluminum and/or polycrystal silicon layers. However, there still remain a number of phenomena which should be revealed prior to development of more advanced version of SOS LSIs. This paper will review the present state of the art, and discuss feasibility of SOS technology, looking at the following matters of interest."
"With the advent of integrated circuits, regular structures appeared more reasonable in cost, and many different approaches to doing logic with arrays were investigated. Notable among these were investigations into associative (content addressable) memories and cellular arrays."
"Bipolar Integrated Circuits, in common with almost every brand of microelectronics, is evolving at a pace that would be considered revolutionary in just about every other area of technology. The importance that computers, communications and defence systems have in our society, the new market opportunities that become available due to integrated circuits advances and the healthy competition between bipolar and MOS is fuelling this evolution. Bipolar and MOS compete for many applications and performance, flexibility and ultimately cost, determine the choice. The fundamental advantage of most MOS processes is their simplicity leading to better yields and therefore lower costs and larger scale of integration. Bipolar circuits on the other hand are generally considered to be more flexible, faster and capable of handling larger currents."
"After a brief excursion into history, the present state of the art in wrist- watch LSI circuits will be reviewed. Future development will then be predicted on the basis of presently available advanced products."
"In the last years the complexity of integrated circuits has grown exponentially. This growth has been achieved primarily by increasing the chip area, by reducing the linewidths, and last but not least by improving devices and circuits. This paper deals with the methods and problems associated with linewidth reduction. It is the aim of the paper to present to the circuit engineer simplified models of typical results which allow him to consider these results for future circuits and assist him in his cooperation with technological engineers and device physicists."

It is assumed that properly designed and maintained supporting structures are provided for the disconnecting equipment, taking into account such factors as location, soil conditions, wind and ice loadings, seismic considerations, and mechanical loads, including electromagnetic forces imposed by the switches, buses, or other equipment mounted thereon."

"The 1976 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements (CPEM) was held at the National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, CO, USA, June 28-July 1. The 1976 Conference was awarded the distinction of being designated one of the scientific meetings to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the National Bureau of Standards. The program emphasized the expanded use of modern technology such as automated measurement systems including microprocessors for precise characterization of components, systems and materials, as well as the precise realization of the SI units. The traditional subjects of basic electrical standards, RF and microwave measurements and time and frequency, and newer subjects such as laser measurements, timedomain measurements, and automated measurement techniques were discussed. Ninety one separate papers were presented, over half of which were presented by attendees from outside the United States. The CPEM series is sponsored by the National Bureau of Standards' Institute for Basic Standards, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the US National Committee of URSI (International Union of Radio Science). The members and affiliations of the 1976 Conference Committee and Technical Program Committee are also listed here."
 "MR. CHAIRMAN, members, and guests of CPEM. There are at least two reasons why I feel honored in being asked to address this meeting. First, the mark of excellence that characterizes the conference — a dynamic, up-to-date conference of international importance, one that has continued to maintain its scientific and technological interest during the 18 years of existence; and second, because I find in looking back through the record, that, I join a prestigious list of others who have served in the same capacity as keynote speaker."
"The UK NPL program of submillimeter-wave absorption measurements on gases is described. The instrumentation is capable of giving absorption line centres to an absolute accuracy of ±0.003 cm−1 (±100 MHz) in the spectral region 10–40 cm−1 (300 GHz–1.2 THz). As well as setting standards of measurement precision at submillimeter wavelengths, the Fourier spectrometer described is being used to compile an atlas of standard spectra at these wavelengths. The results and relevance of measurements on ozone, some fréons and isotopically substituted water vapor are discussed. Examples are given of measurement capability in respect of relative and absolute intensities."
"A brief outline is given of the improvements which have been made in the measurement techniques available for the determination of the complex relative permittivity of liquids and low-loss solids in the frequency range v = 100 GHz to 18 THz. These improvements involve very stable interferometric systems with either dielectric beam splitters for the upper frequency end or else free standing wire grid beam splitters for the lower frequency end, novel cell designs, the use of sensitive detectors, and of new computational procedures. The results can be checked by independent spot frequency measurements using HCN and H2O lasers coupled to an improved Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The optical properties of the polymeric (polyethylene, TPX, polypropylene, PTFE) and single crystal (quartz, silicon germanium) windows now assume an increased importance and we have determined refractive index n (v) and power absorption coefficient α(v) to much improved precision. With our present technique we can now determine the complex permittivity of very heavily absorbing liquids such as primary alcohols and water as far as 6 THz and beyond in favorable cases as functions of frequency over a wide temperature range."
"Up to now, most of the experimental work on propagation through optical fibers was done using pulse measurements techniques. Short-light-pulse sources almost monochromatic and easy to drive to high-peak-power pulses are available on the optoelectronic components market; this is one of the main reasons why fiber manufacturers characterize their fibers by the broadening of the transmitted light pulse. This parameter does not provide enough information on the fiber behavior to the digital transmission system experts, unless one assumes a very-stable pulse shape at the fiber input and uses fast Fourier transform computation on time-domain signals. This paper presents the more classical technique which is being used on transmission cables and devices. The central unit is the network analyzer which can simultaneously provide attenuation versus frequency and phase rotation versus frequency of any optoelectronic device coupled between the reference and the test inputs. Various light sources have been selected for their sinusoidal modulation facilities; most of our measurements were made with fast-light-emitting diodes (GaAlAs 0.82 μm) and some of them with a CW injection laser (GaAlAs 0.82 μm)."
"This single-channel parallel IF substitution system performs attenuator calibrations in a stepped frequency mode to 110 dB through 1–18 GHz, with the accuracy of a fixed frequency system. Measurement time is reduced and operation is simplified by use of two digitally controlled, frequency-locked oscillators as signal source and local oscillator, a 30-MHz precision digital substitution standard and an adaptive bandwidth closed-loop substitution technique. Incident power and source impedance at the insertion point are established by a precision broad-band power splitter and a leveling loop using a barretter as the microwave detector. The load impedance is established by a low mismatch masking attenuator. Measurement sequences can be controlled manually or by a programmable calculator which processes the data. The IF substitution process when under calculator control is terminated when a signal buried in the noise is recovered and the servo-loop is balanced."
"The device under test, which is terminated in a sliding short-circuit, is connected to the measurement plane of a tuned waveguide reflectometer and dc voltages, proportional to the incident and reflected power levels, are balanced, for various short positions, to yield the dissipative component of attenuation. Provision of a switched reference arm in the reflectometer enables the effects of thermal and mechanical changes to the apparatus during a measurement to be minimized. Remaining sources of error are due to power meter zero offset, power meter linearity and mismatch. 99.7-percent confidence levels for a component with a mean total attenuation of 0.1290 dB, at 7.3 GHz, are ±0.0014 dB; the maximum deviation, of the five results, from the mean is 0.0002 dB."
"Since the efficiency ηαl of an adapter for connecting two different transmission lines is a function of the reflection coefficient of the adapter termination, it will be different for each new use of the adapter. This paper suggests two estimates of ηαl for low-loss reciprocal adapters. Maximum limits of error are given in terms of the magnitude of the load reflection coefficient for one estimate ηα0, which is the efficiency of the adapter when terminated in a matched load. Similar error limits are given for the second, more precise estimate, which requires accurate knowledge of both ηα0 and ηα, the maximum efficiency of the adapter."
"SMA connectors in three different configurations were investigated for variation of reflection coefficient magnitude and insertion loss for a given SMA connector connect-disconnect sequence. Repeatability measurements were taken over the frequency range of 2 to 18 GHz on the NBS Automatic Network Analyzer. Plots are given that show the SMA connector repeatability for both reflection coefficient magnitude and insertion loss as a function of frequency."
"A method for identifying scattering parameters of launchers and uniform microstrips is presented. It is shown that 8 complex measurements (magnitude and phase) on two microstrips which are different only in length, inserted between two launchers, can give, with suitable algebraic treatment, the S-parameters of either the microstrips and the launchers. This technique is promising for deembedding active devices as well for microstrip discontinuities."
"This paper describes two techniques for measuring the linearity of amplitude detectors in general, and for measuring the deviation from square-law E of point-contact diode detectors in particular. A general mathematical model is given for determining the RF input power as a function of the detector output voltage. It is shown how to choose the value and the temperature coefficient of the video load resistance to minimize E and make E independent of temperature."
"A technique is described for making reflection and insertion loss measurements on microwave connectors, without the need for reference to calibrated or precision standards. The effects of connectors used in the measuring system are removed from the results, thus providing a means for testing and selecting cables from a group for specific critical applications. Results are given for a group of eight sections of Type 141 solid dielectric line having SMA connectors, and generic behavior is predicted for the SMA connector."
"Group delay standards of 15,30, and 60 ns have been developed at JPL. Calibration data provided by NBS and others are presented and compared. Calibrations were performed at microwave frequencies of 2113,2295, and 8415 MHz as well as at a baseband modulation frequency of 500 kHz. The uncertainties of the measurement and effects of dispersion and cable reflections are discussed."
"Problems intrinsic in self-balancing Wheatstone bridges have led to the development of a new dc substitution microwave power meter. The new instrument allows four-terminal measurement of bolometer resistance and affords improved accuracy and lower noise at a lower cost than earlier instruments. Measurement errors due to imperfect behavior of the servo system are typically less than 0.01 percent."
"A microwave power measurement technique using power saturation effect of the ammonia-gas spectrum is described. The absolute value of the power irradiated on the gas at resonance frequency is measured by detecting the fractional decrease of resonance absorption. Experiments carried out at 23.870 GHz, (J, K) = (3,3) inversion spectrum of ammonia 14NH3, are in agreement with the values calibrated by the calorimetrie power standard, within several percent of the error of the apparatus used. By improvements on the resolution of attenuation measurement and the estimation of the relaxation time constant, the error in power measurement could be less than ±1 percent. This technique could also be applied to the power measurement at many different frequency points in microwave and millimeter-wave region, where a huge number of spectral lines of various gases and their isotopie variants are found."
"The electromagnetic signal of NMR in pure metallic samples emerges as the most reliable technique for measuring low temperatures from 1 K to below 1 mK (10−3 K). This fact stems from the self-consistency of the temperature measurement by NMR, which relies on the Curie law and the Korringa law separately. Samples of Pt, Al, and Cu have been studied with a careful evaluation of the effect of magnetic impurities. Finally the temperatures of the remarkable features of the 3He melting curve which may be regarded as thermometric fixed points have been measured."
"A fully automatic precision thermometer using the NQR absorption of KCIO3 has been developed. The temperature absorption signal is automatically “searched.” The search frequency is locked to the center of the absorption signal and is converted to a temperature scale. Temperature readings from 77 to 374 K, with accuracy, reproducibility, and stability confirmed to ±1 mK at the triple point of water have been obtained."
"For a scattering measurement setup comparisons are made between different modes of operation. In order to make the comparisons, a simple procedure is outlined so that a figure of merit characterizing a given mode can be found. Figures of merit are found for three modes of operation. The different modes of operation are characterized by the manner in which the test object signal is separated from undesired signals such as background and support scattered signals. The setup and the analysis of the measured signals in the different modes of operation are discussed in detail."
"The uses are discussed of formulas derived by input admittance analysis for the complex permittivity of dielectric samples, placed in a matched coaxial line or terminating it, as a function of the Fourier transforms of the incident and reflected real time pulses observed in time-domain spectroscopy. Precautions to be taken for dielectrics with appreciable ohmic conductance are described, and it is also shown that magnetic permeabilities of linear isotropie materials can be obtained by measurements of open- and short-circuited samples."
"The combination of a time-domain reflectometer, signal averager, and lock-in amplifier is shown to increase the amplitude sensitivity of the reflectometer by a factor of about 200 for observing small, multiple transmission line reflections. Replacing the signal averager by a second lock-in amplifier increases the sensitivity further by a factor of 10, but this method is only suitable for measuring reflections from a single point. In the latter case, the minimum, detectable shunt capacitive discontinuity (signal-to-noise ratio of unity, Z0 = 50 Ω) is about 5 aF (1 aF = 10−6 pF); the corresponding value for a series inductive reflection is 10 fH (1 fH = 10−3 pH). The time window drift must be very low to achieve such sensitivity. Methods are described which reduce the intrinsic drift by about a factor of 500 to 20 fs. In precision 7-mm coaxial line, relatively pure shunt “capacitors,” below 0.5 fF, and series “inductors,” below 1 pH, have been constructed and measured using these techniques."
"Various techniques that have been used to calibrate impulse generators and to measure spectrum amplitude are surveyed. A summary of experiments comparing the various techniques is included. The NBS measurement service for calibrating impulse generators is described."
"In 1972, NBS began development of an Automatic Pulse Measurement System (APMS) consisting essentially of a minicomputer-controlled wide-band sampling oscilloscope. The objective of the work was to produce a fast general purpose pulse waveform acquisition and processing instrument with spectral capability in the frequency range dc-18 GHz. The purpose of this paper is to report the highlights of work done on the APMS from early 1975 to present. The measurement applications of the APMS now consist of both publicly offered calibration services and in-house experimental measurements. In the first category, calibration services are available for the following physical parameters: a) Impulse generator spectrum amplitude; b) Wide-band coaxial attenuation/gain; c) Pulse generator transition time. Still in the experimental stage are measurements involving reflection coefficient and impedance, group delay, pulse distortion, and wide-band antenna characteristics."
"The homomorphic transformation is used to separate a time domain reflectometry (TDR) signal into its rapidly and slowly varying components, respectively. The separation (deconvolution) technique is successful in the case where the multiple reflections cannot be viewed in nonoverlapping time windows as is required by the conventional TDR method."
"The use of time-domain techniques for measurement of the transfer characteristics of circular millimeter-waveguide lines in the 40- to 110-GHz band is described. By phase modulating a millimeter-wave carrier, energy is concentrated within the 500-MHz-wide channel of interest. Fast Fourier transform processing of the quadrature components of the coherently detected waveform with transmitter and receiver back-to-back and with transmission over the channel yields the desired transfer characteristic. The transfer function information for the 500-MHz-wide waveguide channel is then used to synthesize an equalizer to compensate for deviations from the desired channel characteristic. The technique described in this paper ensures that adequate signal-to-noise ratio is obtained to yield excellent accuracy (0.1 dB rms in amplitude and 0.1-ns rms in delay) within the 20-MHz resolution bandwidth of the measurement. The frequency resolution obtained is approximately ten times the resolution of time-domain techniques using fast subnanosecond baseband pulses to cover band-widths of 10 GHz or greater. An error analysis is presented which treats the problem of thermal noise entering at intermediate frequency as well as the errors caused by phase jitter of the coherent reference. Actual measurements of a millimeter-waveguide line are included to demonstrate the use of this technique."
"This paper deals with measurements of picosecond laser pulse parameters such as temporal and spatial profile, and power. Pulseshape measurements were conducted by using the combined streak camera and optical multichannel analyzer system. The precision of measurements are discussed."
"This paper describes time-domain instrumentation that was designed to measure impulse response and delay of multimode optical fibers that are being used in an experimental optical communications system at Bell Laboratories. Time-domain data is transformed to frequency-domain by a minicomputer, and the result is displayed as the fiber's baseband frequency response."
"A recently built attenuator calibration setup using swept frequency technique is described. Features of the design include a dual-channel attenuation measurement system, a multichannel analyzer, and a driver device. The measurement procedure is also briefly described with the different steps of the calibration. The results of several types of attenuator calibrations are presented."
"A fully automatic method of calibrating precision rotary-vane attenuators has been devised and evaluated at X-band. The rotary-vane attenuators have been fitted with servo drive units, optoelectronic homing systems, and digital angular measuring systems (with a resolution of 0.0001°). Our X-band modulated subcarrier system has been automated by replacing the manual inductive-voltage divider with a programmable one and adding to it a timing unit, a controller, a frequency stabilizer, a data logger, and servo drive units for the rotary phase shifter and set-zero potentiometer. The results achieved without and with automation are in very good agreement. With automatic operation, the random component of the uncertainty is typically ±0.0002 dB (for 10 measurements and a confidence level of 99 percent). After calibration, these automated rotary attenuators are used in self-balancing radiometers."
"Although straightforward in principle, the extension of existing designs for automatic network analyzers (ANA's) to the higher microwave frequencies is difficult in the current state of the art. What appears to be needed is a basically different approach to the microwave detection problem. One promising alternative is provided by the so-called “six-port” techniques, which eliminate the need for modulation or for frequency conversion, local oscillators, phase detectors, etc. Recent theoretical studies have provided new insights into the basic concept and lead to “five-port” configurations which require three instead of four amplitude detectors. Of particular interest is the projected measurement dynamic range of 50–60 dB corresponding to a dynamic range requirement in the amplitude detectors of a nominal 20 dB or less."
"A computer-operated millimeter-wave measurement system is described. The set performs automated insertion-loss and return-loss measurements on a stepped, discrete frequency basis, and covers the frequency range 40 to 110 GHz. Some notable features of the system are: a computer-controlled signal source of a BWO, extensive error reduction through real-time computer processing, and use of a harmonic comb mixer as a source of precisely known millimeter-wave reference frequencies. Measurement principles and performance features of the system are presented."
"A novel V-band (EIA WG WR-15) network analyzer/reflection test unit has been developed for circuit and/or device characterization in the 50- to 75-GHz frequency range. Swept frequency techniques are utilized to simplify device design and network analysis over a wide range of operating frequencies. The design, fabrication and performance of the unit is presented along with an error analysis for verification of measurement accuracies."
"The frequencies of rare CO2 isotope lasers are measured by comparison with 12C16O2 reference lines and with each other. Improved heterodyne techniques are used to generate difference frequencies in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe varactor photodiode. Microwave frequency counter measurements of the difference frequencies are then used to calculate the band centers, rotational constants and transition frequencies with an estimated accuracy of less than a few kilohertz. Selected applications of CO2 isotope lasers in precision heterodyne calibration, spectroscopy, microwave and IR synthesis are described."
"Metal-to-metal (M-I-M) point contact diodes are used as mixers and detectors for precise frequency measurement of lasers in submillimeter and infrared regions. They, however, are not so stable for mechanical and electric shocks and their lifetimes are short. In order to overcome these defects, discontinuous metal films deposited by vacuum evaporation are proposed to get stable M-I-M junctions, and discontinuous platinum-palladium-alloy films superposed on a discontinuous gold films showed good performance as fast detectors for millimeter wave and CO2 laser signals. The comparison of detection properties of various frequencies showed that the detection was caused by the nonlinearity of the thin film, that is, by the nonlinearity of the tunneling effect between metal islands."
"This paper deals with a homogeneous fiber whose surface is an elliptical cylinder. The effect of fiber parameters on the properties of light scattered by the fiber are defined. The method presented makes it possible to determine the transverse dimensions, the degree of cross-section ellipticity, and the refractive index of single-layer fiber."
"This paper discusses the possibilities of the CO2 laser for providing a very large number of accurate wavelength-frequency standards in the submillimeter to micrometer region of the spectrum and reviews measurements of the absolute wavelengths, including previously unpublished measurements, leading to a value of 9.305 385 635 μm for the R(14) transition, with an accuracy limited by the present definition of the international meter."
"Three methane-stabilized lasers of differing optical and mechanical design have been intercompared. Frequency differences of the output radiations have been measured with the lasers stabilized by similar techniques. Agreement to ±2 parts in 1011 is reported for lasers stabilized by a third derivative method. The stabilized frequency was found to be dependent on the method of stabilization. Frequency shifts of greater than 1 part in 1010 were recorded upon changing the method of stabilization. The effects were studied of the variation of modulation amplitude and the positioning of the detector used to generate the servocontrol signal for stabilization."
"The wavelengths of He-Ne lasers stabilized by saturated absorption in iodine and designed at BIPM, NPL, and PTB have been compared simultaneously by beat frequency measurements. The intention of the comparisons was to get experience about the reproducibility of differently designed lasers. All lasers were stabilized by third harmonic locking but with different electronic circuits. Among other effects, the reproducibility appears affected also by a modulation amplitude dependent shift of the laser frequency f. For a suitable range of modulation amplitudes the reproducibility of the four investigated lasers has been estimated to be ±4 × 10−11 f."
"We report on the most recent design changes in our two primary cesium standards, their current operational use, results obtained, and limitations. NBS-4, the shorter device with an interaction length of L = 0.52 m, has been extensively used for many months as a clock. After improvements in the magnetic shielding and microwave feed, we have obtained σy (1 week < τ < 2 weeks) = 7 × 10−15 in a 10-Hz bandwidth for its frequency stability. NBS-6, the longer, more accurate device (L = 3.75 m), features a linewidth ($\\buildrel {\\sim} \\over &#60; 30$ Hz), which is believed to be the narrowest linewidth ever reported for a cesium device. NBS-6 has been operated to give a short-term stability σy (1 s) = 7 × 10−13 in a 10-Hz bandwidth and has capability of easy beam reversal. The current and past rates of the International Atomic Time (TAI) in terms of our primary cesium standards are reported and compared with the results of other laboratories. With NBS-6 we have calibrated the rate of the NBS time scale of an uncertainty of 0.9 × 10−13."
"The deflection of cesium (Cs) atomic beams using quadrupole and hexapole magnets, or combinations of both, has been investigated. The beam efficiency and the atomic velocity distribution has been calculated for magnets with a cylindrical, conic or parabolic form, respectively. A combination of quadrupole and hexapole magnets allows the selection of atoms in the beam with a relative velocity range of a few percent. A new rectangular frequency modulation method has been developed using modulation widths of multiples of the line width enabling the detection of very small asymmetries of the Cs resonance. By improving the beam optics and lowering the average atomic velocity in the beam to less than 100 m/s, the relative uncertainty of the primary Cs standard CSI of the PTB could be reduced from 1.5 × 10−13 to 1 × 10−13. Measurements of the frequency of the International Atomic Time (TAI) since 1973 showed that on an average the relative frequency deviation from the nominal value is +(10.3 ± 1) × 10−13. TAI frequency measurements with CSI carried out between 1969 and 1973 had revealed a negative TAI-frequency drift."
"The origin of spurious level-dependent phase shifts occuring in amplifiers is analyzed. The effects of nonlinearities in transistors and of a bandwidth limitation are stated. Rules for the design of electronic circuits in which this effect must be minimized are given. Experimental results related to a 40-dB amplifier and to an amplitude limiter, both at 5.75 kHz, are described. The tuning of a hydrogen-maser cavity with the condition that the phase of oscillation does not depend on the amplitude of oscillation is considered. A preliminary precise test of the method is reported and discussed."
"From 1969 till 1976, three laboratories have had primary cesium standards running. Estimates of the frequency of the International Atomic Time (TAI) scale can be obtained from the data of these laboratories. Several estimates according to various assumptions are given in this paper."
"A time comparison experiment via a geostationary satellite was conducted between the stations in the USA and in Japan by a two-way method in SHF band using the Spread Spectrum Random Access communication system. With this system, a high resolution of about 1 ns was obtained in the measurements. The light synchronization discrepancy in the rotating coordinate system of the earth was clearly observed. Making the correction for the error due to the discrepancy, the value measured via satellite coincided well with that obtained through the ground link within an uncertainty of a flying-clock measurement. The accuracy of this experiment was estimated to be about 10 ns."
"The unperturbed hyperfine transition frequency of the Rb85 atoms has been measured using a beam maser device operating under pulsed conditions. Population inversion is achieved through optical pumping in a storage cell. Using a double conversion receiver, frequency measurements were made to a few tenths of a hertz. Magnetic-field effect, cavity pulling, wall shift, and density dependent shift, are the main frequency shifts discussed and evaluated. The unperturbed frequency obtained is 3 035 732 440 ± 3 Hz, which is in agreement with previously published results. The absolute-wall frequency-shift coefficient for Paraflint is measured to be: −176 ± 25 Hz · cm at 72°C. The uncertainties reported are mostly attributed to the reproducibility of the maser storage cell coating."
"In this paper, the author shows how to simplify the complex response of the Hadamard variance by analog filtering to design a spectrum analyzer. The realized spectrum analyzer is described."
"Recent advances of a new generation of Josephson EMF standards are described which are characterized by cryogenic operation of a resistive divider and a sensitive null detector. The advantage of using nonresonant in-line tunnel junctions and the results of resistance alloys at low temperatures are given. An AIMg5 alloy shows a temperature coefficient of resistivity of 1 part in 107/K between 1.5 and 5 K. The magnetoresistance ratio was measured to 10−2 for a magnetic induction of 15 T. Three different methods for the calibration of cryogenic resistive dividers are discussed comprising the series-parallel ratio technique, the superconducting current comparator bridge, and the low frequency inductive voltage comparator. The long-term stability of a resistance ratio of 320:1 by using the AlMg5 alloy has been measured at 4.2 K which showed a small drift of less than 5 × 10−9/h. Results of the recent intercomparison of Josephson EMF standards on the 1-V level are given. Close agreement was obtained to 6 parts in 108 between the BIPM and the PTB-1 Josephson measuring systems which use conventional room-temperature techniques. The difference between the routine Josephson volt standard PTB-1 and a new developed cryogenic Josephson EMF standard PTB-2 is only 9 parts in 109. All results are within the range of the combined (σ) uncertainties of the two standards, respectively. The use of a cryogenic thin film divider in conjunction with a small in-line tunnel junction and SQUID null-detector lead to a significantly reduced size of the cryogenic component parts."
"This paper surveys recent developments in high-accuracy ac-dc comparators, the basic standards for ac current and voltage measurements at audio and higher frequencies. These instruments compare the unknown ac quantity with a dc reference. The ac-dc transfer characteristics of thermal converters, the most widely used comparators, can be evaluated to about 10 ppm at audio frequencies in national metrology laboratories. With recent developments even better accuracies, and greater convenience with automatic comparisons, are feasible."
"The four-terminal capacitance standard described uses two auto transformers to scale the value of a 1-μF capacitor to higher decade values up to 1 F. The direct-reading accuracy is ±0.25 percent at 100,120, or 1000 Hz. Much better accuracy is possible if the 1-μF value is precisely determined, because the scaling ratios are precise. Intermediate capacitance values can be obtained by using an external capacitor. The unit also acts as a standard of dissipation factor and is useful as a two-terminal capacitance standard up to 1000 μF at 100 or 120 Hz."
"In order to take full advantage of recent progress in Josephson voltage standards, improvements of the standard cells maintaining the unit of voltage is of major concern. In particular, the systematic error due to temperature fluctuations, which is an important factor limiting the measurement accuracy, would be significantly reduced if cells were available with smaller temperature coefficients. Our previously reported research on Cd-Pb composite amalgam electrode cells has now been extended to include cells with Cd (10 wt percent)-Sn(5) and Cd(10)-Sn(5)-Pb(5) composite amalgam electrodes. These new cells were found to exhibit the same general characteristics and stability with time as the Cd and Cd-Pb cells reported earlier, except that the temperature coefficients of the Cd-Sn cells were found to be −15 μV/K, slightly smaller than had been observed for the Cd-Pb cells, and the temperature coefficients of Cd-Sn-Pb cells were found to be +23 μV/K. Combination type standard cells, consisting of various series combinations of these four kinds of cells, have been constructed, in which the overall temperature coefficients of the assemblies have been made very small by proper selection of the kinds of cells used and their relative polarity. Voltage standards at the 1-V level having temperature coefficients smaller than 1 μV/K at 20,25, and 30°C have been produced in this way."
"Ten enclosures, each capable of containing 54 standard cells have been designed and constructed. Each enclosure consists of three concentric aluminum cubes separated by foamed polystyrene insulation. The second cube only is controlled at a temperature of 22°C by a precision thermistor and an ac transformer-ratio bridge followed by a phase-sensitive detector, a dc amplifier and a heater. The drift in temperature from the initial settings over a period of 10 months has been less than 300 μK whilst the gradient across the innermost cube has not exceeded 20 μK."
"A highly accurate guarded voltage-ratio standard has been developed for measuring direct voltages from the range of a standard cell to 10 kV. The ratio standard has a resolution capability of 0.1 ppm for ratios of 1:1 to 10 000:1 with an estimated uncertainty of 0.2 ppm. It is designed for operation at a rating of 2 kΩ/V and consists of an adjustable reference section in series with three resistance groups each containing nine nominally equal sections. The resistance ratios are determined by a self-calibration technique using a 1:1 bridge. A series-parallel mode of calibration provides an additional check on the accuracies of the ratios. The standard is housed in a temperature-controlled oil bath whose oil is filtered to remove moisture and contaminants."
"The increased dependence of a standards laboratory on a stable voltage reference has made the maintenance of a “volt” by standard cells a costly and time consuming process. This paper describes an instrument designed to calibrate cadmium-sulfate standard cells directly against a time-invariant superconducting Josephson junction voltage reference, thus replacing the large groups of cells typically used as a voltage reference. An induced voltage of 5.2 mV is produced across the Josephson junction by irradiating the junction with microwaves of a known frequency. A specially designed potentiometer is used to scale this voltage up to 1.01+ V where it can be compared to a standard cell. The overall accuracy (2 σ) of the system is 0.4 ppm or better."
"The most recent and improved Josephson standards are obtained with cryogenic voltage comparators, i.e., by transferring the critical elements of the comparison circuit between the Josephson voltage and the reference voltage to the low temperature of the junction. A cryogenic voltage comparator not of the usual resistive types is presented, which is based on the conversion of the ratio between the two voltages to be compared into an equal ratio between two dc currents, measured with a superconducting dc ratio standard and related SQUID detector. This voltage comparator uses the irradiated Josephson junction as an ideal voltage generator and requires no calibration of resistance ratios. It looks very promising for realizing a cryogenic voltage standard that is simple in both construction and operation and with an uncertainty at 10−9 level. The preliminary implementations of the apparatus and the first results are presented."
"A measuring method is presented which allows the calibration of inductive voltage dividers up to frequencies of 1 MHz. The characteristic element is an auxiliary divider with a 0.5-voltage ratio with adjustable foot and head tap voltages. Error sources due to incomplete guarding are discussed. The calibration uncertainties are ±0.3 ppm at 100 kHz and ±30 ppm at 1 MHz."
"A new 14-range set of thermal current converters consisting of shunted thermoelements has been constructed to measure ac-dc difference and ac current from 10 mA to 20 A at 20 Hz to 50 kHz. The ac-dc difference corrections for all ranges can be determined relative to two ranges by a 7-step intercomparison of certain adjacent ranges."
"The relative ac-dc differences of a group of multijunction thermal converters (MJTC's) have been determined over the frequency range 30 Hz–10 kHz. These MJTC's are of different ranges and were obtained from several sources. Differences were observed at low frequencies when converters of various ranges were intercompared. For voltage measurements, the use of matched resistors in series with the MJTC heater resistors greatly reduced these errors and contributed to the reduction of other errors as well. It is believed that the average ac-dc difference of this group is less than 0.3 ppm at 160 Hz and 0.5 ppm up to 10 kHz."
"A thermal instrument for measurement of low-frequency ac power with a resolution of 1 ppm of maximum input is described. Due to its simple construction and, consequently, low number of error sources, it is well suited to precision measurements. The instrument has been applied to an accurate experimental comparison with the electrodynamic method carried out for identification of errors that cannot be traced by self-checks of each of the systems. The experimental configuration for the comparison is discussed and results of the measurements are given."
"A semiautomatic rms ac/dc transfer standard that permits a 30-fold increase in the rate at which transfer measurements can be made is described. The precision of measurement is ±50 ppm in the automatic mode and ±10 ppm in the manual mode. A novel contactless overload protection circuit is included which allows waveforms of any crest factor up to the breakdown voltages of the components to be measured. The instrument is suitable for programmable operation making it adaptable to systems operation."
"The standard apparatus used to calibrate ac voltmeters in the USSR is described. The test system uses 2 sets of thermoelectric voltage converters rated for voltage values of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 V over the frequency range of 20 Hz to 30 MHz. The high-frequency converters use vacuum single-components with metal-film resistors. Techniques used to establish the accuracy and precision of the test apparatus are discussed and the results of these investigations are then presented."
"Testing passive networks presents problems not found in component testing and requires speeds not available in automatic bridges. This paper discusses a fast microcomputer-controlled admittance bridge designed to overcome these problems and limitations."
"Absolute ac calibration of wattmeters demands sources of exceptional stability. It is felt that for this purpose amplifiers are more superior to rotating generators. Stability and spectral purity of waveforms generated by an amplifier power system lead to the reconsideration of calibration methods, one of which is the use of a differential calorimeter. The result obtained by our method and by power definition through measuring U, I, and angle φ agreed to within 5 × 10−5."
"A two-phase digital sinewave generator with provision for accurate phase shifts has been constructed. A system using this generator for the calibration of power frequency wattmeters at zero power factor is described. This method relies mainly on the phase angles of three terminal gas dielectric capacitors and a four terminal current shunt for quadrature accuracy between current and voltage. An intercomparison with a high-quality air-cored mutual inductor gives phase agreement within ±50 μrad"
"A current comparator technique for the measurement of sinusoidal ac power at 60 Hz is described. The reference power is that generated by applying the voltage across a 10-kΩ resistor. The voltage itself is measured by comparing it directly to a dc reference with an ac/dc rms voltage comparator. The current is compared with the current comparator to the current in the resistor for the in-phase or active power component, and to the current in a capacitor for the quadrature or reactive power component. Six-digit resolution is provided for both components. The bridge can be operated over a voltage range from 50 to 150 V and a current range from 0.01 to 1 A at any power factor. An auxiliary current transformer provides extension of the current range to 10 A. Comparison measurements with a Drysdale wattmeter used as an ac/dc power transfer standard indicates agreement at unity power factor to within 25 ppm."
"A differential thermal wattmeter for the ac/dc transfer of power is described. A differential multijunction thermal converter is used as a “sum and difference” multiplier, with both ac and dc voltage and current signals simultaneously applied to both heaters. Dc feedback to the current input speeds up the response and maintains thermal balance between the heaters, so that the output meter becomes a null indicator. This mode of operation reduces and can eliminate the need for quadratic response. The requirement for exact matching of the thermal converters is also eliminated by effective interchange of the heaters. The converter heaters are protected against burnout, and crest factors of 4 in the ac current or voltage signals are permissible without degradation of the accuracy. Maximum meter sensitivity is 100 ppm of nominal power for full deflection, with a resolution of better than 20 ppm, and a linear scale. The instrument is designed for use at power frequencies of 50–1000 Hz, with ac/dc transfer errors of less than 30 ppm over this range. The wattmeter can be used up to 20 kHz with reduced accuracy."

"Electric fields are determined by interferometrically measuring the phase difference introduced between light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the electric field. The phase difference is introduced by nitrobenzene in the electric-field volume. Magnetic fields are determined by interferometrically measuring the phase difference introduced between left and right circularly polarized light by Faraday rotational glass placed in the magnetic field. The result of either measurement is a finite fringe interference pattern. The position displacement of the fringes is observed in time using a continuous laser and a streak camera to yield the time behavior of the field or in space using a pulsed laser and photographic film to yield the spatial behavior of the field."
"An efficient least squares circle fitting procedure and its general random-error analysis are described. The first-order random errors of the center coordinates and the radius of the fitted circle are discussed in detail. The effect of data point distribution along the circle is investigated, and for an important microwave application (sliding termination measurements) the frequency dependence is also evaluated. The effects of the second-order error terms are also discussed and general formulas are given. Finally an estimation of data point error is provided."
"Describes the design, construction, and testing of a broadside parallel-line directional coupler for 0.4 to 10 GHz. The coupler was built to obtain larger reflected signal levels in the time-domain measurement of well-matched microwave components. It features a 10.75 in (27.3 cm.) tightly coupled uniform parallel-line region to keep internal reflections out of the 2.5-ns measurement time window. Using a 6-V impulse generator the coupler produced a 5.4-dB improvement in reflected amplitude over the usual reflectometry configuration. A major use for the coupler has been in simultaneous measurements of S11 and S21 scattering parameters."
"It is shown that the performance of a given active filter configuration is dependent upon the design procedure employed. Consequently, design procedures may be selected to optimize some aspect of the active filter's performance. This paper develops design procedures which minimize the effect of gain bandwidth (GB) upon a given active filter configuration. The root sensitivity with respect to the GB can be decreased by a factor of two or more depending upon the realization. The techniques presented are applicable to most single and multiple amplifier, second-order active filter realizations."
"See also ibid., vol.IM-22, p.246-9 (1973). Provides an explicit expression for the noise power ratio (NPR) of the memoryless nonlinearity. This expression generalizes previously available results by allowing: wide-band signals; nonflat frequency-spectrum inputs; and nonrectangular notches. The NPR is expressed as a function of the `unnotched' input spectrum and the notch transfer function. Examples are presented to compare the theory with measurements."
"A description is given of a simple circuit for d.c. measurement in a range of several decades with simultaneous logarithmic and linear indications. Separate mathematical analyses are carried out for the cases of employing diodes and transistors as nonlinear elements. The obtained relations indicate the requirements imposed upon nonlinear elements and operational amplifiers to achieve a desired accuracy of measurements. Experimental results have shown that diodes permit covering of a measuring range of five linear decades whereas the transistors cover a measuring range of seven linear decades. The linearity was better than 0.15 percent per decade of variation of measured current. Temperature stability was better than 250 ppm/°C."
"Describes and analyses an ultrasonic spatial locating system. Based on the transit time of a shock wave produced by a small electric spark, the position of one or more sparks can be determined with respect to a coordinate system. The coordinate system is formed by 3 linear electret microphones arranged orthogonally which detect the arrival of the wave front. A microcomputer is incorporated for system control and for calculating the spatial coordinates (X, Y, Z) from the measured transit times. In addition, the computer can be used to perform certain calibration and performance checks to maintain proper system operation. An analysis of the system indicates that it is possible to locate points within a cube 50 cm on a side with an accuracy of better than ±0.6 mm. The acoustic transit time and the ringing of the microphone determine how many samples per second may be taken. Data rates of about 100 per second are well within the capabilities of the system."
"The circuit described generates a constant alternating-polarity time-rate-of-change of magnetic or electric flux. Commutation is performed automatically when a prescribed degree of saturation has been attained. The circuit has been operated over the frequency range 1 μHz to 1 kHz."
"Discusses equipment which can optically sense moving vehicles, and discriminate their sizes. Based on a conceptual consideration on size discrimination, a hardware implementation using a SnO2-Si photocell array and simple electronic circuits is made. The developed equipment can separately count three sizes of moving vehicles along a road."
"Describes an optically strobed sampling oscilloscope which uses optical pulses from a GaAs laser diode to strobe a Cr-doped GaAs photoconductor which serves as a sampling gate. This sampling gate has been used with a commercial sampling oscilloscope to provide a sampling measurement capability that can measure higher voltages than conventional samplers and does not exhibit strobe pulse kickout. Preliminary tests indicate a time resolution, limited by the width of the optical pulse used, for about 100 ps."
"Reports on the improvement of frequency responses of a logarithmic amplifier with a Paterson transdiode connection. The improvement of the response speed has been achieved by using a phase compensation technique. Small- signal response analysis of the logging circuit revealed the effects of a series resistor RP and a parallel capacitor CP on the response of the circuit. The improvement of the frequency characteristics is remarkable at high current levels. These facts were proved by the practical logarithmic amplifier."
"The stability of amplitude-stabilized oscillators is limited by microscopic or macroscopic random phase fluctuations. The authors study the relation between phase and instantaneous frequency and deduce that in general the phase is a process with stationary increments. Some properties of such processes are presented, and in particular the cases where the phase cannot be stationary is discussed. To describe the frequency stability a new method of analysis, the method of finite-time frequency control, is presented and compared with some others previously presented, in particular the Allan-variance procedure. The advantage of the method appears in its definition of short- and long-term stability, its low-frequency spectral analysis, and its determination of the precision obtained in finite-time measurements."
"Describes a simple circuit of a crystal oscillator operating at frequencies from several megahertz to a hundred megahertz with a frequency stability of one part to 108 constructed using a dual gate MOSFET. This RF transmitter accompanied by an RF-tuned receiver can be used as a high-resolution NMR spectrometer and as a precise Gaussmeter."
"Proposes methods of absolute-value and variable-phase operations using switching techniques. These methods show high efficiency and characteristics suitable for use in very-low-frequency regions due to its sampling effects. This paper introduces the basic principle, theoretical analysis, and characteristics of the switching-mode absolute-value amplifier and presents the realization of a variable-phase ultra-low-frequency signal generator by means of the switching-mode operations."
"Basic principles and suggested techniques are presented for calibrating nonideal four-port couplers without standards. Under the assumption that the complex ratio of the side-arm voltages are known, all the parameters, except one of the directional couplers, can be determined without recourse to known values of impedances, shorts, opens, etc. Also, the surprising number of measurements that can be made with such an incompletely calibrated coupler are discussed."

"Two configurations of pulse-type marker-pair generation in sweep generators are analysed to explain the causes of frequency errors in its internal marker-pair. One configuration employs amplitude modulation of the swept frequency oscillator for producing markers whereas the other uses a marker adder circuit after video detector of the unit under test. It is shown that main contribution to the frequency error is not only due to long term drift in tuned amplifiers of the pulse-pair generator circuits but also due to the delay in producing the pulse-pair. It is further shown that the error due to the drift in tuned amplifiers is not compensatable by simple known techniques but the error due to the delay of pulse-pair generator is compensatable to a certain extent by delay of the unit under test for the latter configuration holds good only till the delay of unit under test is not more than twice the delay of pulse-pair generator circuits. Lastly experimental results about the marker-pair accuracy are discussed and comparative advantages of both the sweep generator configurations are given."
"This paper describes a simple method of measuring the discharge energy of an arc and/or the accumulated energy of a series of arcs. This method is based on the conversion of the arc energy into a pulse train, repetition rate of which is proportional to the amplitude of the arc power thereby eliminating the need for the analog circuit to integrate the arc power within arc duration as well as for the analog-digital converter to indicate arc energy in digit to result in a simple circuit. A prototype equipment is constructed by using a digital counter and three modules-operational-amplifier, multiplier, and voltage-frequency converter. The equipment can measure the energy of widely fluctuating arcs without changing the measuring ranges."
"In a great variety of applications, a microwave signal is used to remotely probe a physical object, the modulation of the reflected signal being analysed by a receiver placed close to the oscillator. Limited isolation between the oscillator and receiver may cause serious problems. This paper describes a method to cancel the leakage signal by injecting a compensating signal derived from the oscillator, which is automatically adjusted. Adjustment is performed for the in-phase and quadrature components separately by a pair of independent feedback loops, using a sample of the oscillator signal as a reference. The theory, a number of salient points in the practical realisation, and the performance obtained are discussed."
"Treats the design of solid-state pulse generators with risetimes less than 100 ps. These generators have been used in time-domain measurements on microwave components and materials to obtain frequency characteristics from time domain waveforms. A brief review of various sources including avalanche transistors, tunnel diodes, and step-recovery diodes (SRD's) is given. The main feature is a description of a 60-ps risetime step generator with modifications for impulse and RF pulse outputs. In the step generator an avalanche transistor driver produces a 30-V step, which is successively sharpened by two SRD's to a 20-V 60-ps risetime step. A trigger signal is provided by the first SRD followed by an internal 70-ns delay so that the faster pulse from the second SRD stage can be displayed on a sampling oscilloscope with no additional delay lines. The basic step can be differentiated to produce a 6-V 60-ps halfwidth impulse or filtered to generate a 1-V 500-ps wide RF burst with principal spectral amplitude in the 9-16 GHz frequency range. These generators provide a larger instantaneous spectral amplitude than the commonly used tunnel diode pulser."
"A noncontact velocity measurement system utilising a solid-state array imaging a moving laser speckle pattern was developed for measuring the velocity of a moving vehicle relative to the terrain it traverses. The electronics and the online minicomputer program together with the laboratory system test results are described."
"A detailed design is presented for a digital pseudo-random noise generator. The instrument is built with standard integrated circuits. It produces both binary noise (pseudo-random binary sequence) and white Gaussian noise of variable bandwidth. By setting front panel switches to match tabulated octal codes, one may select a vast number of independent noise programs."
"The sal- and cal-functions of the well-known Walsh functions are used to construct a simple and minimal Walsh function generator. Codes at random sequence or a sequence of codes at random time are generated. A generated code automatically enables a particular stimulus (which may be visual or audible) or any appropriate objective external stimulus (depending upon the response time and the reflex action) to be measured. The time accuracy is determined by the particular application and upon the particular response. This particular measuring system is designed for measurements of response time of the man-machine interaction but measurements can be extended with minor modifications to response time of interest to medical, biological, physiological, and psychological fields."
"The problem of measuring the decaying edge of bandlimited transient signals in `real time' is discussed for signals with a priori unknown arrival time, peak amplitude and envelope shape, whose decay time to rise time ratios are in excess of 50. An instrument is proposed to identify, measure and normalise the peak of the transient signal and thus permit measurement of the decaying edge to be made from a known reference. Signal envelope estimates made at the local maximum of the incoming transient are used to define the transient peak. The effects of noise on the peak detector operation are examined, noise produced peak position errors computed and a noise threshold monitor is incorporated into the proposed instrument. Measurements of the performance of a simplified transient peak detector/normaliser contained in an acoustic reverberation meter designed by the author are presented."
"The application of the Laverick 2:1 voltage step to the absolute calibration of microwave attenuation measurement systems is described. A practical example of a 10 GHz 6.0206-dB switched attenuator illustrates the contention that a very good attenuation measurement system can be checked within its own laboratory to an accuracy one or two orders of magnitude better than is usually possible in an intercomparison between laboratories."
"An accurate and instantaneous microwave phase and amplitude measurement technique is described, that makes use of a single-sideband generator and a single-sideband detector. The phase and amplitude values of a microwave signal are transposed to an IF signal of a convenient frequency. The dynamic range may be as high as 80 dB and the phase and amplitude errors in this range are below 1° and 0.1 dB, respectively."
"With dual-slope integrating analogue-to-digital (A/D) converters, which are most frequently used for relatively low-speed conversion, the drift of the operational amplifier is a very critical factor in limiting their performance. The newly discovered digital self-calibration method which completely eliminates the drift problem, is more readily adaptable to ratiometric conversion, where the input and the reference voltages are of the same polarity. Some of the advantages are: no necessity of manual adjustments, the use of inexpensive operational amplifiers instead of costly units with no performance degradation for the temperature range limited only by digital circuits, and the possibility of A/D converters operating on a single power supply. As is the case with the basic dual-slope converters, no precision components of high absolute or relative accuracy are required."
"A thermal noise source consists of a matched termination and a transmission line. A method which permits a direct measurement of the correction due to the transmission line effects on the thermal noise source without any measurement of temperature, loss, and reflection distribution in the transmission line is presented. Generalised expressions for the equivalent temperature of the thermal noise source are derived, which are composed of the temperature of the matched termination, the output reflection coefficient, and the transmission corrections. It is shown that the corrections can be determined from reflection coefficients and noise outputs of the source in which the matched termination is replaced by a short. A possibility is suggested, that higher accuracy in the correction will be obtained by the new method than by conventional ones. A 10-GHz noise source is tested by the method."
"A novel swept frequency method for cavity parameter measurement applicable to both transmission- and reflection-type resonators is presented. Signals proportional to the input reflection coefficient squared |S11|2 and/or signals proportional to the transducer gain squared |S21|2 of the cavity under test and of a reference cavity, e.g., a wavemeter, are combined in an XY-plot to give closed-loop curves. These curves may be simply evaluated for accurate values of all cavity parameters, as there are resonant frequency, loaded Q-factor, and coupling coefficients. Thus the simplicity of swept frequency techniques and the accuracy of more sophisticated methods are combined to give, upon proper averaging several independently obtained results, an accuracy of better than ±1 per cent."
"This paper intends to give circuit designers a survey of the performance limits of transistors in the avalanche region and show their practical use in reliable long-lived devices. The most important problems encountered when designing special circuits are discussed in detail. In particular, the conditions for obtaining reflection-free rectangular pulses are presented. Furthermore, criteria for choosing the proper transistor types are given, and some rather suitable types are specified. Finally, different methods of parallel and series operation for large current and voltage pulses, respectively, are discussed and demonstrated."
"A system for safeguarding a moderate power high voltage laboratory against transformer overcurrents following insulation failures in test objects is described. It is simple, requiring the construction of only two solid-state control circuits and the modification of a commercially available solid-state contactor. It has been tested successfully with simulated breakdowns at up to 50-kV rms, 60 Hz with a 50-kVA load."

"An error analysis for absolute flux density measurement of radiosource Cas A is discussed. The lower-bound quadrature-accumulation error for state-of-the-art measurements of the absolute flux density of Cas A around 7 GHz is estimated to be 1.71 percent for 3σ limits. The corresponding practicable error for the careful but not state-of-the-art measurements is estimated to be 4.46 percent for 3σ limits."
"Discusses the unique configuration of circular four electrode capacitors which permits diagnosis and assessment of changes in capacitance without using a reference standard of superior stability to make the measurements."
"Theory is developed and experimental data is presented for a noncontacting, nondestructive transient eddy current testing technique that can be used for conductivity measurements on flat surface samples over a range of at least 300<;σ<;6×107 mho/m. Furthermore, this technique is shown to be useable for measurement of the thickness of plating of electrically conductive material over the range of at least 0.1 μm<;x<;50 μm. The method is based on pulse excitation of a small coil above the sample. The pulser and display unit is a commercially available time-domain reflectometer."
"Based on a method first proposed by Barlow (1962) the paper discusses how the complex permittivity of a sheet material can be determined by measuring the Q and frequency change produced by a sample when it is placed in a circular evanescent waveguide which is coupled to a resonant cavity. The method appears to be satisfactory for dielectric materials with loss tangents above about 0.01. Measurements on two mixtures of polystyrene and carbon, taken at 9 GHz, are reported."
"A `big instrument' is developed from an automatic measurement system by adding an internal measurement structure, measurement accuracy specifications, and a front panel. It is done so that the user perceives one instrument instead of a collection of instruments. Any big instrument is directed toward an end user. Its measurement set is chosen to satisfy this user's need and, therefore, eliminates his software development tasks. The big instrument front panel has the same three functions as a simple instrument front panel: definition, execution, and presentation."
"Describes two methods which utilize only integral revolutions, counted over a continuous run. The first method-method of differences-permits the test to be limited (with moderate stabilization) to a single revolution, with mean precision ±0.02 percent. The second method-method of coincidences-measures accurately the relative error from a number of revolutions, dispensing with a stabilizer. No specially equipped reference meter need be used. A large number of meters can be tested within a short time interval by a single operator without special training. These methods, primarily developed for watthour meters, are suitable for other rotating instruments as well."
"The theory of the optically pumped passive Cs frequency standard is given. Experimental results confirming qualitatively this theory are presented. The results are also compared to those obtained in the case of Rb. Experimental results on the pressure shift and temperature coefficients of the hyperfine frequency of cesium atoms in four buffer gases, CH4, N2, Ar and Kr are presented. Finally graphs for evaluating a given pressure coefficient and the residual temperature coefficient for mixtures of buffer gases are given."
"Discusses a new digital variable radius circle generator which allows high precision TV sets adjustment. The problems which involve the use of complex digital squarers are avoided through an original computing program; square functions are performed by means of successive sums of subsequent odd integers in an accumulator circuit. This unusual digital technique offers higher flexibility than commercial generators at low price."
"This system's rms frequency-measurement error due to noise is calculated, and the effect of a limiter upon IFM performance at high input signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's) is determined. At high SNR's, IFM performance with or without a limiter is similar to that of a limiter and discriminator. However, the IFM threshold can be higher (when BT=1) or lower (when BT≫1) than that of a limiter and discriminator, and IFM accuracy exceeds that of the latter at SNR's below the limiter-discriminator threshold. The IFM threshold is not due to Rice's `click' phenomenon but, rather, to second-order noise×noise effects like those in the square-law demodulation of an AM signal, which result in a more gradual decline in performance with decreasing SNR."
"The method is based on perturbing the fringing field at the open end of the transmission line by an unknown dielectric material, and is applicable not only for solid dielectric materials but also for liquids and gases. Forming or shaping of solid dielectrics is not required, but there should be a small area available for contact. Thickness of the dielectric material terminating the line does not affect the measurement unless the material is thinner than twice the spacing between conductors of the coaxial line. The experimental results obtained for some solid dielectric materials, liquids, and biological tissue shows that the method has sufficient accuracy for most applications up to about 4 GHz."
"An investigation is made into the possibility of fully integrating an instrumentation amplifier in monolithic form. Of many types of instrumentation amplifiers, the one with voltage-to-current conversion appears to be most suitable for monolithic integration. For a low price per unit the number of components external to the IC must be low. A circuit configuration which requires only two external resistors to fix the amplification factor accurately is the differential-difference amplifier (DDA). This configuration possesses some particularly useful applications."
"The influence of nonlinear effects on the dynamic behavior of self-heated thermistor flowmeters is studied. The nonlinear equation which describes the device thermal balance is solved by numerical methods and the theoretical previsions are compared with the results of experimental measurements. The results emphasize that a description of dynamic behavior of thermistor flowmeters by means of one time constant is very unsatisfactory. Either response time or sensitivity can be changed appreciably by changing the bias conditions of the self-heated thermistor and a criterion is suggested for the choice of bias conditions which provide the best response speed and sensitivity of the system."
"Describes the design, development, and application of a digital electronic processor for measuring the frequency of the burst signals typically produced by laser Doppler velocimeters. The processor has an extremely large dynamic range with an upper frequency limit of 100 MHz and a dead time (processing time after acquisition of single burst) of less than 10 μs. It employs precision to amplitude converters to determine the period of the Doppler signal, resulting in a frequency measurement error of less than one percent over the entire range. Although developed primarily for laser velocimeter application, this instrument can be used in any situation where the frequency of burst signals containing only a few cycles must be determined."
"The apparatus described is designed to make measurements of the thermal conductivity of ceramic materials at high temperatures. It is based on the radial heat-flow method. The apparatus enables measurements of the thermal conductivity of ceramic materials at any temperature over the range from 100 to 1100°C. In a single operation measurements at five selected temperatures can be made automatically. Results of measurements of the thermal conductivity on a few ceramic samples are presented."
"Active d.c. directional couplers which are combinations of conventional transmission line attenuator networks and d.c. amplifiers are described. The circuits of and design equations for signal-detecting and signal-injecting directional couplers with responses which are inherently flat from d.c. to an amplifier-dependent upper frequency limit are presented."
"Currently available microprocessors usually represent the control and processing portion of a small computer. Their implementation as an LSI package represent a viable low-cost alternative to the use of minicomputers in the areas of digital instrumentation and control of data flow. Some existing microprocessor designs are surveyed, the objective being to obtain an understanding of their suitability for the above mentioned applications. A possible design for a statistical analyzer for the measurement of mean and variance in real time is also considered. A different organization of a microprocessor as compared to the existing designs is proposed. This organization considers the control aspects only. Thus it can yield a simple but special purpose microprocessor, when combined with an arithmetic element."
"An electrometer is described which will measure the transient currents in an electrochemical cell activated by a pulsed polarization potential. This electrometer consists of dual current to voltage transducer stages allowing differential current measurement. Each stage has dynamic stepped-up gain capability which can be varied under digital control. The dynamic gain enables maximum sensitivity of measurement while preventing saturation of the amplifiers by large magnitude current spikes present at the initial application of the polarization potential. The electrometer can measure the current passing through an unshielded electrochemical cell with an accuracy of ±10pA. The electrometer does not affect nor interfere with the electrodes performance. Also, the instrument does not influence the electrochemical processes. This electrometer has application in pulse polarography and other amperometric type electrochemical measurements."

Differences between values reported by the five participating laboratories fell within the total uncertainties given by these laboratories. The estimated limits of uncertainty given by the laboratories varied from a few tenths to several percent."
"A new current transformer aimed at monitoring for purpose of protection and control of EHV power systems and based on the application of a microwave YIG-tuned transistor oscillator as a sensor is suggested. The principle of operation, description of the experimental system, and experimental results of the laboratory and field tests are presented. It is found that the concept of remote monitoring of the EHV system by this electromagnetic current transformer is technically and economically fully feasible."
"Describes a serial output sign and magnitude successive approximation A/D converter. After deciding sign bit at the first clock pulse the signal is applied in one polarity to an A/D which uses minimum hardware. Off the shelf TTLIC's have been used. Parallel output can be obtained with minor modifications."
"A method for the measurement of contact current using LED and an optical detector has been described. Using this method, a current of the order of milliamperes can be measured. Finally the merits and demerits of the method have also been discussed."
"The use of a bridged RC ladder as a single resistance controlled variable frequency notch filter is discussed."
"A circuit which resolves a group of binary signals and identifies the order in which they arrive is described. A digital summation threshold-logic (DSTL) gate, having multithreshold outputs is made use of to realize the required logic of the circuit presented."
"Dr. J. A. Barnes from the National Bureau of Standards has pointed out to the authors that the derivation of [2, eq. (2)] from [1, eq. (19)] is not correct."
"A time shared Basic cross assembler for the Intel 8080 microcomputer is reported. Also are included utility programs allowing such functions as editing and listing of source files. Combined they form a powerful tool for microcomputer programming without excessive system cost."
"It is shown that the theorems derived for the direct mean-estimation with time-interval quantization by Torrien (see ibid., vol.IM-24, p.96 (1975)) are valid in a wider sense than originally proposed, and that they are special cases of a more general description using the quasi-static model of analog-to-digital conversion."

"Those faithful Spectrum readers who are unfortunate enough not to be regular subscribers to the Proceedings of the IEEE missed a fascinating issue of that journal, the September issue, devoted to “Two Centuries in Retrospect.” A joint venture of engineers and historians, the guest editors, J. D. Ryder and J. E. Brittain, identify it as an experiment in intellectual collaboration that was made possible by a singular conjunction of circumstances and personalities that might itself someday be studied by historians."
"Reviews the principle and types of electronic home video game units available."
"Telemedicine-the use of telecommunications to facilitate health-care delivery over large distances-is an attractive technology that promises to help solve the problem of geographic maldistribution of medical facilities and personnel. Telemedicine encompasses the practice of diagnostic medicine through the use of telecommunications technology to substitute for in-person contact between patient and physician. It includes broadband as well as narrow-band transmission of medical information. It also includes communication between doctors for consultation, and between groups and individual medical practitioners and other professionals for education and training."

"Individual members of the Institute, as well as all IEEE organizational units, are invited to submit the names of candidates to be considered for appointment to the following 1978 standing committees and boards:"
"Many electrical engineers have become accustomed to claiming deductions on residential expenses incurred from doing business in their homes. For some, an office at home is merely an extension of the workday — they can justifiably argue that they cannot suddenly turn off their creativity when the clock strikes five and, therefore, their salaried income should be prorated against their office-at-home expenses. Other engineers claim deductions based on consulting done out of their homes to supplement their income. Under the new Tax Reform Act of 1976, some of these deductions may still be possible, but significant changes written into this legislation necessitate a careful review of what is — and what is no longer — possible."
"A completely packaged low-priced microcomputer system for OEM applications: The “System 80/10,” a completely packaged low-priced microcomputer system, includes a resident memory, programmable I/O, system monitor, power supplies, and an OEM front panel. The system can be expanded with the addition of up to three optional memory and/or I/O expansion boards. Software can be developed for specific OEM applications and may reside in either nonvolatile read-only memory or RAM."

"The concept of a “science court” has now gained a sufficiently high profile to, at least, prompt serious discussion of a formal experiment. However, although few question the concept's ultimate objectives, many question it as a viable means of reaching those objectives. As a modest test, a task force of the Presidential Advisory Group on Anticipated Advances in Science and Technology has proposed such a court, in which the idea, in the committee's own terms, would be to “develop adversary proceedings and test their value in resolving technical disputes over questions of scientific fact.” The members of the group admit that, more often than not, they define “scientific fact” as the anticipated result of an experiment or an observation of nature — a definition that some find unconventional."
"Discusses the advancements of HF components with increased density and performance. Outlines the development of monolithic integrated circuits (bipolar IC's using ECL; GaAs FET's; GaAs TED's). Describes in more detail the development of a complete receiver for L-band (1 to 2 GHz) operation on one or a few chips. Discusses the development of millimeter waves components with particular emphasis on the `suspended substrate line' technique."
"Outlines engineering advances in proportional myoelectric arm prostheses and multifunctional arms using microprocessors. Describes a telescoping arm on the VAPC Quad manipulator wheelchair for quadriplegics, which provides nine degrees of motion freedom. It allows its user, through chin manipulation of a joystick, to do everything a normal person can do (through the attached pseudoarm) and permits total patient mobility."
"Compares the following concepts involving vertical-axis wind machines with regard to their suitability for commercial power generation: constant-speed constant-frequency systems (synchronous and induction); and variable-speed constant-frequency systems (field modulated system; double-output induction generator system; a system using an AC commutator generator; and a system employing a synchronous inverter)."
"Research and development effort by contractors to U.S. Government agencies is either “directed” or “independent.” Directed R&D is that done by a contractor in a specific technical area selected by the agency awarding the contract or grant. Independent R&D (IR&D) is that done by a contractor as the result of his own decision as to the kind of research projects and programs he will pursue. A contractor is reimbursed by an agency for all directed R&D costs (under the terms of the contract) and for some IR&D costs. There is little quarrel over the policy of reimbursement for directed R&D costs. But IR&D cost reimbursements have been a seat of controversy ever since Congress first became involved directly in the IR&D area in the late 1960s."
"In April, Spectrum had the privilege of attending the international conference of the “elite 100”∗ members of the Club of Rome (CoR) — in Philadelphia. CoR's membership reads like a global Who's Who: It consists of scholars, scientists, technologists, economists, and leaders of industry from countries throughout the world. In fact, the three-day meeting seemed like a “mathematical model” of a plenary session of the United Nations."
"“I think I shared the feeling of most citizens that the pace in Congress is slow, that a Congressman's job is not very demanding, and that the norm in Washington is lots of receptions, lots of vacations, and more than adequate pay.” The speaker is Diane Wyble — 25 years old, an electrical engineer, an IEEE member, and an employee on leave from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. In an interview with Spectrum, Ms. Wyble frankly recalled her disenchantment with Capitol Hill prior to her arrival there, in January of this year, as an IEEE Congressional Fellow."
"Sure I'm bitter: How would you like it if you'd been in the business for 16 years, reached the classification of senior engineer, then opened your mailbox one morning and found they were going to pay you less than the new graduate who lives down the block?"
"Advanced modeling program provides improvements in capability and interface: ISPICE 2.01 is an interactive computer-aided-design (CAD) program that is said to be much improved in modeling and analytical capability, efficiency, and operator interface over its earlier version, ISPICE 1.34.

"In the previous issue, we broached the topic of scientists and engineers expressing viewpoints concerning the application of technology to systems affecting the public. We endorsed a suggestion, made by Alvin Weinberg, that a greater responsibility in debates before the public would entail a clear distinction by a scientist (or engineer) between judgments based on scientific fact and those based on something less than fact. Such, however, may be an ideal that is not achievable."
"As a guide to the instrument user, examples of typical changes brought about by the use of microprocessors in instruments are outlined, together with important points to be considered before purchasing a microprocessor-based instrument."
"The use of microprocessors in medical instruments centers on their power and flexibility. The ability to perform logical decisions and computations quickly and cheaply, coupled with the ability to use software programs to handle specific functions, has opened up a new era in medical instrumentation."

"Describes the basic IEEE specifications of CAMAC, acquaints practising system engineers with its basic principles and applications, and gives insight into how this standard can benefit the digital engineering community."
"From small simple digital panel meters to large sophisticated test systems, integrated circuits continue to have a vast impact on improvements in instrument performance. The driving force behind all this has been the continuous increase in IC-device volumetric efficiency-from SSI to MSI to today's LSI ICs."
"Two trends can be seen in test and measurement instruments. The first is the movement toward instrument clusters-mini instrument systems-and away from the individual instrument of the past. These instrument systems are either hooked up together with external interface cables, or are tied together on card cages in a single package. The other trend is the development of low-cost dedicated instruments to do well only specific tasks at minimum cost."
"Several typical applications are described after a brief introduction to spectrum analyzer operation."
"The continuing advancements in electronics technology have created a need for oscilloscopes that can perform many new types of measurements. Spectrum and logic analysis, sampling, digital conversion, and time-interval measurements are just a few. Oscilloscopes have therefore branched out into several distinct configurations, each designed to meet a particular group of these measurement needs."

 "The first generation of large-capacity bubble-memory prototypes has emerged from the laboratory. Capable of storing 65 kb and larger amounts of information on a single chip, the new memories reflect steady improvements in materials, chip-circuit design and packaging."
"The effect of undesirable phenomenon is defined as `an apparent reduction in capacity to a predetermined discharge voltage cut-off point (usually one volt) resulting from repetitive use patterns'. The suspected cause, and the reasons for its rarity, are explained after a brief discussion identifying the main components within a sintered-plate cell."
"The impact of modern science and technology on archaeology has been remarkable. Modern methods for dating human events, which have been developing over the past 30 years, are altering the whole framework of man's history as we now understand it. Aerial and satellite photography now help archaeologists select sites of potential value for eventual excavations. In the field, sophisticated instruments that sense minute changes in the earth's magnetism have been successfully employed to pinpoint old buried structures, whereas sensitive sonar devices help underwater archaeologists locate shipwrecks. And these are but a few of the areas where this impact has been felt."
"Manufacturers avoid producing technologically advanced devices for real and imagined reasons."
"In recent years, the power industry in the U.S. has experienced dramatic changes in the fundamental forces that govern the costs of meeting increasing electric power requirements. Because of these forces, the increased capital costs of system expansion - plus higher operational costs - have raised the bills of power consumers. Thus, the electric utility industry is now examining a range of proposals relating to the subject of \"load management.\" Although these proposals differ widely in their scope and complexity, they are generally intended to control or shift the peak electric demand in order, possibly, to reduce fuel requirements and to reduce the need for system expansion."
"Its biggest show in five years will mark WESCON's celebration of its 25th year in business. When the 1976 Western Electronic Show and Convention opens its doors at the Los Angeles Convention Center on September 14, convention goers will be able to view the wares of about 400 companies, occupying 725 exhibit booths. Not since 1971 has a bigger show been put together."
"This 10-bit monolithic D/A converter is priced as low as $9.95 for units with a maximum error (relative to full-scale output current) down to ±0.05 percent. The low-cost and high-accuracy features are attributed to a laser \"zapping\" process introduced during the wafer probe step of the production cycle. With the new process, the chip is designed with parallel resistive structures for all critical resistance values. These parallel structures are linked at a number of points by \"shorting bars.\" During the wafer-probe process, the output of each chip is measured and, if the accuracy is out of specification, a computer-monitored laser beam zaps the sequential shorting bars until the desired accuracy is obtained."

"Some callings in life are emotionally satisfying, and are also inclined to win friends for their practitioneers. Others may meet the first requirement but not the second. Indeed, the latter class is guaranteed to generate a core of unhappy constituents, adversaries, or outright enemies. We place in this category the judge, the legislator, the public executive, the journalist, and, of course, the baseball umpire!"
"We read the daily papers mostly to find out what has gone wrong, and presumably to learn from the mistakes, faults, and problems or others - or, at the very least, to feel good about not being personally involved. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a seminar labeled “Failure of Human Systems,” the not very surprising conclusion was drawn (among others) that a failure is often considered as shameful, as something to be suppressed, particularly if the failure is construed by the participants as a personal rather than as a project failure. Thus, it is understandable that many individuals who do “make the papers” are not happy about it."

This article discusses the successes and failures that have made Illiac IV significant in the development of computer technology."
"The implantable cardiac pacemaker is now beginning to reach the useful lifetime it was supposed to have had 15 years ago. Many of the early failures of pacemakers now occur only rarely. But why they occurred at all, what was learned from them, and what has been done to try to prevent them from recurring, is the essence of the article."

"More than 1800 pages of comments from 87 individuals and organizations were received in response to the issuance of the draft report of the Reactor Safety Study, known popularly as the Rasmussen Report. (The study was directed by M.I.T. Professor Norman Rasmussen with a team of 60 participants.) In the August 1975 issue, Spectrum published an article by Professor Rasmussen in which he analyzed findings of the report. (A sampling of comments relating to that article appears in Forum, along with Professor Rasmussen's reply.)"
"Just as the vacuum tube was at the heart of nearly all electrotechnology through the forties, as were the transistor and integrated circuit through the sixties, the core technology of the seventies, and perhaps beyond, seems certain to be the microprocessor. It is entrenched in applications that were merely hinted at a year or two ago, and is now insinuating itself into many unlikely corners of industry. In the report that follows, scores of experts including numerous members of IEEE Groups and Societies, aided Spectrum's editors in uncovering not only new applications of microprocessors, but new development s in a broad spectrum of electrotechnological applications that ranges across commercial, industrial, and Government areas. In this special issue, we attempt to emphasize present and near-term developments as opposed to long-term projections. Thus, existing hardware and software are referred to, and are further identified by manufacturer when to do so is significant."

"With Federal R&D budgets now at their highest in over a decade, the United States seems firmly committed to a continuance of its technological superiority despite the ravages of inflation and the public clamor to cut spending in every sector of the economy. Budget increases for military, aerospace, and energy research were particularly high last year, with development of new weapon systems, the space shuttle, and new sources of power having the highest priorities."
"The spark and crackle typically associated with new consumer electronics were subdued during 1975. Though the spotlight played briefly on video disks, little hardware is yet available — excitement dissipated quickly, awaiting the “big push” still scheduled for late this year when MCA/Philips and RCA start marketing players in the United States. Calculators were personal, portabl, and plentiful this past year, with new entries by Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments leading the pack. And jewelers, accustomed to the familiar tick of mechanical timepieces, had to adjust to the silence of the digital watch-which, as prices tumble, is showing up in chain store windows as well as posh display cases. Here, the technology tug-of-war revolves around readouts: light-emitting diodes (LEDs) vs. liquid crystal displays (LCDs)."

"During the 1960s, system theory was dominated by an interior point of view, conceptualized by a state and state-variable methodology. Since 1970, however, the exterior point of view - embodied by operator theoretic techniques - has emerged as a viable contender in the area, a distinction that is inescapable when reading through the special issue on system theory that the Proceedings of the IEEE has prepared for January 1976."

"Not so many years ago, the forecasts of the great majority of those in the business of telling society where it might expect to find itself five, ten, and more years hence were based largely on trend extrapolation. There was good reason for this. First, World War II had left the industrialized nations with clear-cut needs. Winners and losers alike were in dire need of many basic, material necessities that had been unavailable or were destroyed during the war. And individual and corporate profits resulting from the war were available, as energy in a tank circuit, to provide the impetus for producing and consuming the wanted goods. Population was expanding and thus reinforced the image of an insatiable marketplace. Materials to produce consumer goods seemed in plentiful supply, as did energy to produce and utilize such products."
"With domestic colour TV sales nearing saturation, the pressure is on for receiver manufacturers to develop a brand-new market for home TV systems. The possibilities here include (but are not limited to) video disks, large flat-screen displays, higher-resolution TV (more scanning lines), and narrowband transmission allowing many more channels than are presently available."
"The birth of the telephone — one hundred years ago this month — is a fascinating story of the genius and persistence of one man. In addition, it is an instructive demonstration of how an industrial giant, in this case the Western Union Telegraph Co., can miss its chance to foster an industry-creating breakthrough — something that has happened again and again in electronics and other fields."
"A comprehensive energy-conservation program by Bell System is developed that is designed neither to impair telecommunications services nor to affect negatively employee welfare and morale. This program covers the following major areas: electric power for the operation of switching and transmission equipment for the US nationwide telecommunications network; electric power and fuel for building systems; transportation fuels for the vehicle fleet; and electric power and fuel for the manufacture of cable, wire, printed wiring products, and various telecommunications equipment such as telephones, data sets, and teletypewriters."

"From the technical expert's mind to the pages of IEEE Spectrum, the information we publish moves through a complex sequence of transformations, most of which are guided and carried out by the members of our editorial staff. However, once an edited and reviewed manuscript has found its way to the printer, computers and electronic equipment take on the central role of converting it into typeset columns and pages."

  "This 36-page catalog includes a discussion of capacitance, inductance, and resistance standards. The importance of the frequency characteristics of standard capacitors are explained, and the effect of losses - expressed in the form of a dissipation factor - is described. Considerations in designing and using resistance standards for ac operation are presented and compensation of decade boxes is discussed. The construction of inductance standards, inductance changes, Q changes, and calibration of standard inductors are covered."
"Charge-transfer device (CTD) technology is maturing, although it has been only six years since the introduction of the bucket-brigade and the charge-coupling concepts. This maturation is apparent from the devices that are becoming available commercially and from the many papers in the joint special February issue on charge-coupled devices of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits and IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices that describe devices for specific applications. In the words of the two Guest Editors of the issue, “the moment of truth for the technology is now rapidly approaching as charge-coupled devices (CCDs) face trial in the marketplace and have to compete both in cost and performance with other technologies.”"

"Do you think you've been paying more and enjoying it less? By the end of this year the dollar bill you socked away in a savings account in 1967 won't be worth more than 59 cents. By the end of next year, that dollar will have been torn in half by a decade of money-hungry inflation. Successful \"Big Business\" has learned to live with this inflation spiral. In some instances, so have the trade unions - a number have negotiated rigid \"cost-of-living clauses\" into their contracts assuring their members annual cost-of-living raises. But among professionals, few have been able to keep pace with soaring costs, and the same holds true for many of the professional associations to which they belong and to which some look for relief when times get hard."
"IEEE is currently experiencing some of its most serious financial challenges since the merger in 1963. Despite a 1976 dues increase, the Institute's Executive Committee determined that only an 8-percent reduction in the professional staff payroll could produce a surplus budget while, at the same time, maintaining the generally high level of member services. Further, the only alternatives to another dues increase in 1977 would seem to be either a severe cut in member services or deficit spending. In light of the potentially serious consequences to the member of this financial quandary, Spectrum interviewed IEEE's current President, Joseph K. Dillard. His forthright responses to our questions are presented herewith in the hope that a better-informed membership can help guide our Institute through the difficult economic times that lie ahead."

"When recently we addressed the subject of advocacy science (or advocacy engineering), we drew attention to certain of its drawbacks. For example, an advocate is inclined, either overtly or covertly, to emphasize facts that tend to support his cause. Conversely, he may be expected to overlook or even suppress those facts that tend to undermine his cause. Advocacy clearly fosters polarization, and may easily lead to the use of an “adversary” process, which itself can be helpful. But the predominant danger may be that, while science and engineering thrive on the disclosure of new facts, advocacy science and engineering may even discourage the dissemination of old facts."

"A somewhat heated controversy has arisen within the IEEE in regard to an official Institute position against the California Nuclear Initiative. As published in the June 1975 issue of Spectrum, p. 26, IEEE's position opposed a California moratorium, called for by the referendum to be voted on next month, on construction of nuclear plants. Reacting angrily, a portion of IEEE's membership has expressed the belief that the Institute's position is not representative of the overall membership, and some have suggested that a vote should have been taken to determine member opinion on the issue."

"Being thing-, not people-, oriented has become a description of engineers so loudly proclaimed that engineers themselves accept it without challenge and even with a degree of pride. However, not everyone perceives the appellation as completely positive. Indeed, it is relatively an easy task to induce a nonengineer acquaintance to reveal his hitherto hidden thoughts about the “technical personality” simply by asking him what he thinks of that time-worn cliché: “engineers are thing-oriented.” Likely he'll say:"

"Power struggles and factional clashes make the individual histories of the major engineering societies surprisingly fascinating topics for investigation. Of equal, or even greater, interest to IEEE members are present-day similarities and differences in these societies' approaches to member services. Last month's Spectrum told the stories of four of the \"Founder Societies\" - an appellation derived from the joint society financing and construction of two headquarters buildings over the years. IEEE's predecessor society, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE); the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE); and the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME) were all discussed in some detail in the May issue. Significant differences in the approaches of the individual societies to member services were explained as outgrowths of conditions surrounding the formative years of each society. This sequel to that article completes the comparison by considering the fifth Founder Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), and IEEE's other ancestral society, the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). The article concludes by addressing several present-day concerns of the Founder Societies that will be of particular interest to IEEE members since those concerns reflect on some of IEEE's recent or incipient controversies."
"Perhaps you didn't get last month's Spectrum - or when it arrived, it looked like a nervous politician had run it through a shredder. Maybe you wish the Institute would stop issuing policy statements on nuclear energy - or you want it to take a position on the environmental consequences of the Alaska pipeline on the American Eskimo. Or perhaps you're after technical information and you're not sure which of IEEE's many publications will best serve your needs."

"Would it were that Spectrum's Bicentennial look at the next century U.S. cities might suggest a fulfillment of the idyllic line sung perennially, if unthinkingly, by thousands of school children -from sea to shining sea.— Unfortunately, A. P. Adamson's thought is far more realistic. And yet it is precisely this dualism — the ideal vs. the real — that best characterizes both this issue of Spectrum and the endeavors of engineers, architects, and urban planners who devote themselves to getting from “here to there”: from disorder to order, from the present to the future, from the real to the ideal."
"Not a single human achievement was conceived or realized in the bracing atmosphere of steppes, forests or mountain tops. Everything was conceived and realized in the crowded, stinking little cities of Jerusalem, Athens, Florence, Shakespere's London, Rembrandt's Amsterdam. The villages, the suburbs, are for the dropouts ... we will decay, we will decline if we can't make our cities viable. That's where America's destiny will be decided - in the cities."
"It is quite clear that we have come to, or are rapidly approaching, the end of a special epoch in the industrial West - characterized by sprawling urban-suburban complexes, massive interlinked highway systems, rich high-technology industries, and profligate consumerism, and fostered by an economic structure that favors an energy-extravagant society. It has been an epoch in which the individual automobile has been the technological heart. Perhaps for this reason, and also for many other reasons, those who are concerned with cities seem to be reformulating basic or root questions: “What is a city?” “Why does it work, why does it not work?” Dependent upon one's answers to these questions will be the kind of “solution” one poses for the problems with which our cities are palpably afflicted."
"Scratch an architect or a city planner of note and he'll be glad to give you his philosophy for the ideal city of the third century of the U.S., complete with all of its ramifications: fuel and energy conservation; optimum mass-transit systems; ideal communications; and a milieu in which human needs, aspirations, creature comforts, leisure, and convenience are paramount considerations."
"Best-known, most publicized, and least built of radical new city concepts are the \"arcologies\" of Paolo Soleri, an Italian-born and -trained architect who has made his home for many years outside Scottsdale, Ariz. An arcology - a word coined by Soleri, connoting architecture plus ecology - is a self-contained, morphologically various, three-dimensional structure that constitutes a whole living city in itself. Although some people may regard Soleri's designs as megastructures, he is careful to remind us that they are really a form of miniaturization of cities, in which functional interactions are highly integrated. Thus arcologies embody ideas far more soaring than the primordial housing and city functioning that most megastructure or merely monumental concepts suggest. Arcologies are lit by a visual imagination whose only match in words (for my money) appears in Invisible Cities, a poetic novel by the Italian writer Italo Calvino, or in Anabasis by St. John Perse."
"Two principles guided George Dantzig and Thomas Saaty in their design research for the compact city: conservation of space — namely, an effective use of vertical space; and conservation of time — namely, a set of urban facilities that would be utilized 24 hours a day. They started unabashedly and squarely with systems science and operations research, aiming at a city design that would maximize efficiency and minimize cost. Out of this approach, they derived a cake-shaped, cylindrical, totally enclosed city structure that minimizes transportation costs, minimizes energy losses, minimizes traffic congestion through vertical and horizontal flows, and that supposedly modulates peak loads on service functions by arranging life and work across a 24-hour “day.”"
"Ideally, Toroid as planned, would be a city of approximately a million people. Its population would be limited so as to permit optimum design of the physical infrastructure with minimum cost to the citizens. Some 300000 jobs would be needed here, divided approximately evenly between the service sector and primary industrial jobs. At least ten major industries would be sought in diversified sectors with none employing more than 15000 people. One university for about 10000 to 15000 students would be required, with a proportional arrangement of primary and secondary schools."
"Something of major import is happening to cities in the United States — something that overrides strictly technological considerations and makes a mockery of the best-intentioned plans of urbanologists and systems experts. No consideration of the city of the future can be meaningful without a hard look at what amounts to an urban revolution: the movement of people away from the old and toward the new, and the migration of people from the northeast and central cities toward southern and western ones. The effect of these trends has led to a favoring of the horizontal, or low-density, city over the vertical, or high-density, city, and an abdonment of the 19th-century metropolis for the “new”cities of the 20th century."
"Every day the city dweller encounters a growing number of urban systems that can make life convenient or frustratingly irritating. Much of the impact of these systems on the individual depends on the sensors, terminals, message panels, displays, and other input-output devices that form the interface between systems and citizens."
"Where will our future cities find the energy to keep industry going, to transport goods and people, to keep our homes and offices adequately lighted and comfortable all year round, and to operate such vital equipment as communication systems, computers, refrigerators, and other apparatus without which our everyday life would seem intolerable? In the United States, the energy for these many end uses traditionally has come from such sources as coal, petroleum, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, although the share of each of these elements in the energy pie has been changing over the years. The use of petroleum, for example, went up from 14 percent in 1920 to 46 percent in 1973, while the contribution of coal over that same period shrank from 78 to 18 percent."
"The Nuclear Energy Center Site Survey (NECSS) was a study of a potential alternative siting approach for nuclear power and fuel-cycle facilities-an approach that would cluster sizeable groups of such facilities on a relatively small number of sites, as contrasted with current `dispersed' siting practices."
"Since prehistory, the growth and maximum size (in square kilometers) of cities has been largely determined by the quality of local transportation. Ideally, urban transport should be frequent, dependable, fast, convenient, safe, and inexpensive. In developed nations, the private automobile has met these goals so well that once secondary questions of land use (roads, parking), energy supply, pollution, and social impact have become the major issues. Though most planners admit that autos will remain a major component in any foreseeable urban/suburban transportation \"mix,\" they expect vigorous competition for riders from new mass-transit systems. Indeed, greatly reducing (or restricting) automobile travel through downtown business districts seems the only guarantee against endless traffic jams, unhealthy pollution levels, and parking garage architecture."
"The telecommuting research project to be described here was partially funded by the National Science Foundation and was concerned with the locations of businesses within cities with particular emphasis on the phenomenon of commutation to work. The major questions addressed by the project are: How easily and how effectively and under what circumstances can we substitute a computer terminal or similar device for a private automobile in the work situation? What is likely to be the consequence of this replacement if it occurs on a large scale? A case study is presented."
"In an interview published in the March issue of Spectrum, IEEE President Dillard advised a dues increase in 1977. At the time of that interview, it was not known what the effect of the 1976 dues increase would be. Nevertheless, President Dillard felt that under the most optimistic circumstances, another dues hike would be necessary in 1977, if only to maintain the 1976 level of member services in the face of inflation. After all, there had already been an 8-percent staff cut and this staff reduction was still not expected to produce a year-end budget surplus. With the May meeting of the Board of Directors upcoming, Spectrum interviewed IEEE Treasurer Burkhard Schneider to find out what had occurred since the Dillard interview that might affect President Dillard's recommendation of a 1977 dues increase. Had the 1976 budget turned out to be realistic? What recommendations would be made to the Board prior to its May meeting?"

"Three or four years from now, the chances of your working side-by-side with a female engineer will have increased dramatically. Then, women engineers will be entering the work force in numbers worthy of note and comment. Those of our male colleagues who remain convinced that a woman's place is either in the home, or in occupations more traditionally “feminine,” are duly forewarned. As for the rest of us, we can only welcome the change as long overdue."

"In modern high-speed aircraft it is vital that primary flight control information be clearly and unobstrusively presented to the pilot. The head-up display (HUD) meets this requirement by providing relevant scales, alphanumerics, symbology, gunsight reticle, etc., superimposed on the pilot's forward field of view. With most HUD designs, the information is calligraphically presented on a high-brightness cathode-ray tube and projected through a collimating lens to a combiner (partially silvered glass) located between the pilot and the aircraft's windshield. Making the HUD concept an even more valuable aid for military aircraft pilots was the task of Grumman engineers retrofitting the US Navy's F-14 Fighter cockpit with an improved HUD design. In this discussion, the progress of the project is traced through difficult, often conflicting, engineering problems to its present form, which is-according to US Navy pilots-a substantial advance in the state of the art."
"An important aspect of electronic switching is the availability of customer services and administrative features made possible by stored program control. More than 480 features and services are now available in the Bell's No.1 ESS, and by the end of this year this system will include almost twice the number of features previously available in the most sophisticated electromechanical switching systems. Flexibility, as was originally predicted, has proved to be the most important advantage achievable with stored program control. Furthermore, it has been possible to reprogram the systems to obtain greater capacity through the use of improved program techniques. The demand for new No.1 ESS features is growing and being met expeditiously, but the rate of new feature introductions is still insufficient to satisfy all requests."
"High-voltage d.c. transmission has proved a promising competitor to conventional extra-high-voltage a.c. transmission under several conditions-where long transmission distances from generation to load centers exist; where asynchronous ties are required; or where underground or underwater cables of considerable length are necessary. Now, developments are underway on higher-voltage overhead lines and cables, higher rated converters, more versatile controls, d.c. breakers, improved sensors, and compact substations that will permit HVDC to play an ever-greater role in future power transmission."

"The importance of the subject of this special issue cannot be over-emphasized' to the readers of this Transactions. A large number of the members of the IEEE and our other readers are intimately involved in the process of innovation as active participants groping with the nitty-gritty aspects of technical innovation in their day-to-day work. A number of us are also making significant efforts to understand and report on the phenomenon as observers and researchers. In publishing this special issue, we fully empathize with the comments by Langrish, Gibbons, Evans and Jevons in their preface: “The process of technological innovation is so universally recognized to be of salient importance for the life of modern man, and yet so imperfect is our understanding of what makes it happen in the ways that it does, there need be no undue academic reticence about bursting into print with something that may make a possible contribution, even though it does not have all the answers pat”[1]."
"The study examines the relationship between outside influences and the firm's innovation process. A sample of commercially successful and unsuccessful R&D projects of a number of firms is discussed in terms of diverse market, resource, technical and organizational factors. The stimulus for a project, the sources of ideas used and the influences of competition and regulatory constraints were expected to vary among industries, and these differences are described. The authors suggest that their findings might be understood based on the evolution of a business from one having initially fluid and independent product and process technologies to one having a highly automated process technology designed for a specific standard product. Consequently, the relationship between product and process will shape and constrain the firm's ability to innovate in response to a changing environment."
"High technology enterprises are important elements in the present and future of the nation and the world. Such enterprises have a number of special characteristics that cause them to differ from the much larger number of businesses which managers normally operate successfully. These special characteristics must be recognized by enterprise managers to avoid many of the problems which have beset high technology endeavors in the past. With appropriate understanding of the special effects of high technology on general management considerations, high technology enterprise can play an ever-increasing role in attacking complex long-term national and world problems with which the future seems to abound."
"The study investigated the effects of: seven techno-economic factors, extent of top management support, six dimensions of organizational climate, and three modes of joint decision-making, on the adoption of NASA innovations. Seventy-three cases in sixty-five organizations were studied. Data were collected through field interviews and questionnaires. Parametric influences of communication channels and involvement of the innovator were examined. Implications for organizational design were considered. The data indicated that top management support was of primary importance in the success of product innovations. But techno-economic variables were of primary importance in the success of process innovations. The data also indicated that organizational climate and conflict resolution mechanisms were different in the successful and unsuccessful cases. Involvement of the innovator in implementation of the project was also found to be important."
"Research focused on the new product joint venture organization is presented. A new product joint venture is defined as a new legal entity or organization formed with the patents, technical skills, a marketing system and managerial experience from two independent contributing corporations for the purpose of developing, producing, and marketing a product innovation."
"A short history of automotive diesel development is presented and then the generalized benefits of the recent deployment of computer aided design (CAD) techniques are discussed. Four short case histories are presented demonstrating particular product benefits achieved using theoretical stress analysis, digital simulation techniques, analog simulation and finite element stress analysis. The progressive development of diesel engine technology is considered in three chronological phases, namely test, instrumentation, and analysis. The effect of each operating mode upon complementary organizational structures is discussed briefly, and the structure preferred by the writer's company during the contemporary analysis mode is presented in some detail."
"The new venture is a total business activity organized to introduce a new line of products or penetrate a new market. The emphasis is on a total business organization. Major corporations find that innovative organizational structures, such as new ventures, are necessary to launch new businesses. The characteristics of the new venture are described. The operational aspects of a new venture are emphasized, especially the characteristics required of the manager. To be successful, new ventures demand thorough and effective planning. Plans include market forecasts, a thorough research on customer needs, financial analyses and organizational planning. Advantages and limitations to the divisional versus corporate new venture structure are emphasised. Since the new venture is a financial activity within a corporation, proper support and management guidance must be present to insure its success."
"Recent changes in both government and corporate attitudes towards R&D budgets make effective R&D management more important than ever. This research provides a data base for improving R&D management through better understanding of the information flow and management style variables in the innovation process. The research reported concentrates on the initial idea generation stage of innovation. It has four main parts: (1) a background discussion of technological innovation emphasizing idea stimuli and behavioral characteristics of innovators; (2) a description of the types, sources and channels of stimulus information; (3) a discussion of the role and importance of R&D management discussion making styles; (4) a new model for the idea generation stage which incorporates information flows and a variety of possible managerial and policy actions."
"Two dimensions (personal-impersonal and internal-external) are used to characterize information sources as they become important during the interorganizational transfer of production innovations. The results of three studies are reviewed for the purpose of deriving a model of the timing and importance of different information sources and the utilization of new technology. Based on the findings of two retrospective studies, it was concluded that the pattern of information seeking behavior in user organizations during the awareness stage od adoption is not a reliable predictor of the eventual utilization rate. Using the additional findings of a real-time study, an empirical model of the relative importance of information sources for successful user organizations is presented. These results are extended and integrated into a theoretical model consisting of a time-profile of successful implementations and the relative importance of four types of information sources during seven stages of the adoption-implementation process."

"The subject of this special issue, the Management of Interdisciplinary Policy Research and Analysis (IPR&A), was first presented at a session of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in January 1975. Since little has been written about the subject, Joe Coates, Director of Research at the Office of Technology Assessment, recommended that we try to capture the thinking of that session. The papers by Nilles, Polishuk, Baer, and Beal are revised and reviewed versions of papers given at that meeting. They represent papers from three different points of view — government, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Future issues of this Transactions should include similar views from industry to round out the picture; however, the overall general observations probably will not differ. In the papers by Nilles, Baer, and Polishuk, both Interdisciplinary Policy Research and Analysis (IPR&A) and Multidisciplinary Policy Research and Analysis (MPR&A) are defined, and the definitions are amazingly close. The definitions offered by Nilles are quoted here: Interdisciplinary Policy Research and Analysis (IPR&A) — “Implies the joint, coordinated, and continuously integrated research done by experts with different disciplinary backgrounds, working together and producing joint reports, papers, recommendations, and/or plans, which are so tightly and thoroughly interwoven that the specific contributions of each researcher tend to be obscured by the joint product. It involves the interaction of clearly nonadjacent disciplines such as the physical sciences with the social sciences and/or law, economics, etc.”"
"The growth of independent research centers after World War II reflected the federal government's concern for defense-related research and policy studies. These centers had more independence than government laboratories; greater emphasis on interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research than universities; and fewer conflicts of interest than industrial laboratories. The same factors carry over to interdisciplinary policy research in nondefense fields. The major problems of managing interdisciplinary team, selecting and motivating project leaders, maximizing institutional support, selecting the right projects and clients, and linking research to policy-making."
"The primary issues of interdisciplinary policy research (IDR) management are discussed, especially as they relate to the universities in the United States. Performance requirements for effective policy research are given, followed by the initial conclusion that high-quality policy research is generally performed in spite of several elements in the traditional university environment, not because of them. The discussion of methods for developing effective research programs begins with an analysis of the reasons why a university should or should not engage in IDR and covers the following key factors: 1) availability of resources; 2) departmental influence; 3) communication; 4) management methods; 5) planning, review, and evaluation; and 6) professional staff."
"The potential usefulness of dynamic system models in the evaluation of the development of telecommunications has been investigated by a multidisciplinary team. A dynamic model of northwest Ontario was constructed and tested, while some work has been done towards the construction of models of individual communities within this same region. All these models are based on extensive study and field work by the multidisciplinary team. A major feature is a detailed discussion of how sustained multidisciplinary cooperation was developed during the course of the project, with a special emphasis on the informal coordination appropriate to the conduct of such work, which was on a relatively small overall scale, but involved six different disciplines in a university environment."
"With the increasing complexities of government policy and decision making, it has become necessary to take an interdisciplinary approach to policy analysis and problem solving. An attempt is made to describe the important managerial factors in the planning and implementation of a policy analysis organization based on the experience of the establishment of a telecommunications policy analysis function within the US Department of Commerce to provide policy research and analysis to the Executive Office of the President. The institutional factors, problems, and needs particular to government are stressed."

"After the series of special issues over the past year and a half-Project Selection (November 1974), Innovation (February 1976), and the Management of Interdisciplinary Policy Research and Analysis (May 1976) — this issue covers a wide range of topics in the overall field of management of research, development, and engineering. The Daltons present an approach to improved operation of engineering groups through some of the newer approaches to organizational and individual development. Many R, D, & E organizations have tried different approaches to improving communication, decision making, and other aspects of group operation. Here is a particular one, based on the growing field of humanistic psychology, which includes many different techniques for achieving openness, self-awareness, and personal growth. In the search for improved effectiveness, many managers have also tried to improve the climate in their groups and organizations for another reason-for the very sake of improving the climate-in the hope that this will make the working environment a nicer place to be. Where specific and convincing economic justification for any new training program or management approach is required, such an objective, by itself, may not be acceptable to the people paying the bills or running the organization. However, one can always make the argument (if not prove it) that more satisfied people are more productive than less satisfied people and that organizational climate significantly affects satisfaction. Souder and Rubenstein present a more formal and rigorous approach to improving R, D, & E effectiveness through administrative experimentation (see the May 1974 special issue on this subject). The suggested experimental approaches derive from research on the R&D/innovation process in a wide variety of contexts."
"The concepts of transactional analysis are applied to teams of engineers. These ideas show the engineer how `he' can change and that he alone is responsible for what happens in the future, no matter what has happened in the past. Transactional analysis offers a framework for increased communication to facilitate engineering decision making. Since transactional analysis is a behaviour model, it can be used in conjunction with something like the managerial grid and the Johari window to improve team effectiveness. A model for planned renegotiation is outlined in the event that the initial expectations of an engineering team do not develop as planned."
"This study is concerned with eleven successful and eleven unsuccessful innovations as well as ten innovations in progress. The data were gathered by the author in West Germany in 1974-1975. The earlier findings on the effects of demand pull and technology push are augmented with this study, which offers further evidence that the high number of successful innovations start from demand pull, while the high number of unsuccessful projects start from technology push. The successful and unsuccessful projects are compared in level of effort and elapsed time, and the process versus product R&D decision is examined. Ten current projects are examined and the social forces are found to be diffuse. Two examples demonstrate the importance of the necessary integration between technology and the environment."
"Reports research done to increase understanding of communications in organizations. Using a typology of organizational communications developed by Greenbaum (1974), four types of communication networks and their relationships to satisfaction and performance were examined. Measures of the four suggested types of communication were also empirically developed. The four types of communication were: 1) informative, 2) regulatory, 3) status quo, and 4) integrative. The results indicated that informative and integrative communications were generally more satisfying and beneficial to employees than regulatory and status quo communication. It was speculated that the influence of communication would vary because of the employees' task demands, role conflict, and ambiguity, and that these would be reflected by organizational level of the employee. A further analysis of the relationships between types of communication and satisfaction and performance revealed that organizational level was a significant moderating variable. Implications for organizational practice were suggested."
"Concern over a decline in the productivity of research and development (R&D) activities in the US economy has stimulated a search for ways to correct this situation. This paper presents a model of the RD/I process and a list of candidate experiments. The model was developed on the basis of an analysis of significant variables found by other researchers, case studies, and interviews with research administrators. The experiments were deduced from this model with the aid of a logico-deductive design paradigm and a panel of experts. The model and the list provide insights into the RD/I innovation process, and a checklist of policy guidelines and administrative actions for further study."
"In order to define behaviorally the R&D manager's job, extensive interviews and observations were conducted of R&D managers. The result is a categorical description of the R&D manager's job with a start of behavioral definition in each category. A validation of the categorical model was performed."

"The five papers in this issue deal with two critical resources in the management of research, development, and engineering (R, D, & E), or, indeed, in any kind of human enterprise-human resources and information."
"A data-base management system has been applied to the management of test results in the development of an integrated-circuit (IC) memory device. The system software is largely independent of the specific device tested and can be applied to any IC device that can be characterized by chips within slices within lots. Several sets of parametric and go-nogo test sequences can be maintained simultaneously. Changes in the tests can be made with no change in the reporting software or the data-base structure. Only one program need be changed when an entry system format is changed."
"The work plan analysis and scheduling technique, WoPAST technique, was developed to plan and schedule complex engineering programs when early ideas and goals are still fluid and responsibilities are general and gross. The basic techniques were adapted from other planning systems, and the approach was kept as simple as possible without sacrificing any necessary detail. It lends itself well to enhancing communications among participating people and groups and in reconciling dependencies and commitments. It compartmentalizes resource planning by a responsibility element and so avoids the lengthy cycles and iterations associated with other detailed planning techniques. After an agreement and commitment to a total plan is made, detailed monitoring and tracking is handled on a personal basis and succeeds by using peer pressure and personal identification to keep plan integrity high."
"The questions of do and should universities provide management education for undergraduate engineers are addressed. Then, the approach to management education that is being used at the State University of New York at Buffalo is described. This approach consists of a senior-level elective engineering course. The central theme of the course which unifies the many topics of discussion is the preparation and presentation of a proposal. The course is described in sufficient detail so that the reader can identify the various elements of management education that are woven into the material presented to students."
"The relationship between technical uncertainty and the technical decision maker's selection of information channels/sources is investigated. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 384 engineers and scientists in a large government R&D organization. Findings indicate a strong correlation between technical uncertainty and a decision maker's choice of more efficient information channels/sources."
"The author's experience of managing a medium-sized engineering organization using `management by objectives' (MBO) is described. A description of some of the problems encountered, the means by which they were solved, and some guides for others who might wish to apply MBO in an engineering context are included."

"Anerobic fermentation of organic matter — a process in the absence of atmospheric air — generates a mixture of gases: methane and carbon dioxide. The anerobic bacteria decompose the organic matter into sludge and methane, a gaseous fuel with a good calorific value. A number of organic wastes are suited to this method of methane generation: animal refuse such as cow dung, municipal and sewage wastes, vegetable wastes, human wastes and algae. Out of all these, for many a developing country with large population of cattle, cattle dung holds high promise. In this paper, I shall concentrate on the methane fuel economy based on cattle dung."
"Public policy and legal issues about a technology arise when negative effects from that technology are perceived. If the anticipated magnitude of the negative effects is expected to approach the benefits and the technology implementation is pervasive, then the debate will be amplified."
"Since reading your interview with Dr. Enrique Kirberg I have visited Santiago, Chile and several towns in Chile. While I do not know anything of the political background of Dr. Kirberg I could think that it might have been far to the left as that of the present President of my alma mater the T.U. Berlin. That could explain his treatment by the present regime."

"Energy stands among the foremost issues at the interface of technology and society, and has therefore been a major concern of the IEEE Committee on Social Implications of Technology. The particular field of nuclear energy is undoubtedly the most complex of the immediate energy issues that we face; it demands the utmost objective analysis of its technological, environmental, and societal facets. That demand has caused the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, at governmental request, to initiate a major new study of nuclear energy and the alternatives. In discussing that study, Academy of Sciences president, Philip Handler said, \"We are aware of the polarization of attitudes on nuclear energy among the public and in the scientific community as well\" (Science, 190, 961, 1975)."
"The Board of Directors of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. hereby goes on record as supporting the rapid and orderly development of nuclear electric power."
"On June 8, 1976 the citizens of California will vote yes or no on an initiative setting forth the conditions under which nuclear power plants will be permitted to operate in the state. The California Nuclear Safeguards Initiative would require the following: (1) Within one year, the federal limits on liability for damages caused by a nuclear accident must be removed by law or by waiver for accidents in the state of California. (2) Within five years, the state legislature must find, by a two-thirds vote, that the effectiveness of reactor safety systems had been demonstrated by actual tests on \"substantially similar physical systems\" (presumably, large reactors) and that radioactive wastes can be stored or disposed of with no reasonable chance of eventual escape into the environment. Unless these conditions were met, new construction of nuclear power plants would be prohibited and existing plants would be derated and eventually phased out."
"67501. The people and the State of California hereby find and declare that nuclear power plants can have a profound effect on the planning for, and the use of large areas of the State, as do related facilities connected with the manufacture, transportation, and storage of nuclear fuel, and the transportation, reprocessing, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials from nuclear fission power plants."
"The following IEEE position statement on the \"California Nuclear Initiative\" (proposed moratorium on nuclear plants) has been approved by the Executive Committee, Region 6 Director Carlton Bayless, and representatives of the Western States Intersociety Legislative Advisory Project"
"In March 1973, with the energy crisis dominating the political scene, the British government agreed to an expansion of the country's thermonuclear fusion research programme. This work, at the Atomic Energy Authority's Culham Laboratories, is a truly international project financed partly from Euratom resources. Similar programmes exist in France and Germany, while laboratories in the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union appear to be devoting even greater effort to the problem of harnessing the hydrogen bomb reaction than do those of Western Europe."
"There is a clear need for development of alternative energy sources to replace the depleting hydrocarbon fuels on which we depend for 3/4 of our energy. The characteristics that would be desirable of future energy sources are that they be extensive, inexhaustible, widely available and that they present the minimum hazards to health, the environment, and the \"quality of life\". Solar energy, as one of the proposed alternatives, is examined here; the principal subprograms are summarized and their present status is described. The state of development of the different solar technologies varies widely from solar heating of buildings that is ready for commercial development to ocean thermal generation of electricity that is in design stages. It is found that several are well enough advanced to be \"under-used technologies\" and their cost projections under conditions of industrial development are favorable. The time scale for significant contributions from solar energy is, by conservative estimates, 10 years. Among the proposed alternative energy sources we find that solar energy is unique in its possession of the desired characteristics as well as further important advantages. It therefore seems appropriate that the utilization of solar energy be designated as our highest priority energy development goal."
"Robert D. Pollard, a project manager in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and chief safety engineer for the nuclear plants at Indian Point, New York, as well as nuclear plants in North and South Carolina and Texas, publicly announced his resignation. He charged that the Indian Point plants were unsafe in design and construction, and were susceptible to accidents that could cause large-scale loss of life and other radiation injuries. He said that he could not \"in conscience remain silent about the perils associated with the United States nuclear power program.\""
"I was distressed to read Balabanian's \"review\" of the book, Introduction to Engineering (by Glorioso and Hill) in the December (1975) issue of the CSIT Newsletter, especially so since Balabanian has become our new editor. For certain, Glorioso and Hill may be faulted with failing to emphasize the broader social obligations of the engineer, and to sensitize their readers to the danger of unexpected and undesirable technological side-effects. But such possible shortcomings hardly deserve the greening broadside in which Balabanian makes false assertions, evidently misrepresents Glorioso and Hill's statements, and overall engages in contradictory and specious reasoning. For instance:"
"A code of professional ethics for engineers should be. regarded as a positive factor that defines, encourages, and supports ethical behavior, rather than as a negative factor that outlaws and punishes the unethical."
"One of the skills that members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and others, have developed is called systems engineering. It includes the understanding of complex interacting assemblages, and design or intervention so that they perform in some desired way. Projects such as landing a man on the moon would be impossible without systems engineering."
"It has been suggested that systems engineering offers a new and effective route to the solution of societal problems, and it has been accordingly proposed∗ that IEEE and others should therefore advocate the use of systems engineering as a social tool — perhaps even present it as a social breakthrough. There is no doubt that systems engineering has something to contribute to a variety of social-technological dilemmas such as we now face. Yet I believe it is misleading to elevate the systems concept to the status of a social breakthrough."

"A review of: \"Nuclecar Power Plant Safety - I,\" By Gadi Kaplan and Ronald K. Jurgen; and \"Nuclear Powoer Plant Safety - II by Donald Friedlander (IEEE Spectrum, vol 15, no 5, pp 52-75, May 1976) is presented. The reviewer concludes that the shortcomings of the articles appear to be due in part to an effort by Spectrum to publish the material as soon as possible; yet, Spectrum has been in no great hurry to air the issues raised by other knowledgeable nuclear critics (e.g., Gofman, Tamplin, Ford, Kendall, Alfven, et. al.) over the past five years. Editor Christiansen conceded that the articles do no more than \"open the door to further, substantive discussion of the complex issue of nuclear power implementation.\" It is to be hoped that Spectrum will now follow through and provide the thorough, substantive discussion that is so long overdue."

"Dr. Enrique Kirberg spent twenty years as a professor of illumination engineering at the University of Chile. In 1968 (two years before the election of President Salvadore Allende) he was elected Rector (President) of the Universidad Tecnica del Estado in Santiago. He served in that capacity for five years until he was abruptly removed during the military coup in Chile in 1973 and spent the next two years in prison without charges of any kind and without a trial. He was released on September 11, 1975 as a result of extensive public pressure from many sources outside Chile, including a letter from CSIT to the Chilean government."
"The Interests of the consumer have in recent times received a great deal of publicity, which in turn has produced a few real, tangible, and even significant benefits. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a U.S. Government body, is one of the truly significant products of the somewhat amorphous consumer movement. I speak from personal experience with the CPSC; and as an engineer and a Professor of Electrical Engineering. I offer the following account of one engineer's effort to follow his conscience and look out for the interests of society, and his own interests as well. This may sound oddly reminiscent of a soap opera, with never ending complications surrounding Young Doctor Malone. Indeed, that appraisal is very close to the truth; with all parties — the good guys, the bad guys, the doers, and the talkers — all viewing themselves as Young Doctor Malone, who somehow must correct the ills of society and, in particular, the ills of power lawn mowers, which is what this article is all about."
"In early May a public argument over nuclear reactor safety was precipitated by Keith Miller, professor of mathematics at the university of California/Berkeley and consultant to the Advanced Code Review Group of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Miller had been working on codes for predicting the behavior of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). In a memorandum and a long letter to the NRC Commissioners dated May 6 and 7, and in a televised interview on May 12, Miller charged that the codes are totally inadequate to the complexity of the problem of accurate prediction, that the present ECCS has major design flaws, and that NRC is not justified in licensing any more reactors with that design. He also expressed concern that NRC has not been candid with the American public in its implication that there is virtual certitude associated with nuclear power plant operation. Other consultants to the Code Review Group did not share Miller's views. Miller will continue to serve as a consultant."
"As a member of the IEEE/IRE for almost 35 years, may I comment on the March issue no. 13 relating to nuclear power."
"Because the united States Activities Board (USAB) — the professional activities board of the IEEE — has recently created a task force to consider an award for service in the public interest, it seems worthwhile to reflect on the fate of a CSIT proposal for such ail IEEE award."
"An AdHoc Committee on Ethical Standards was appointed in conformity to item VII-A in the NPSS AdCom Minutes of May 14, 1975. This committee consists of J.R. Roth, NASA Lewis Research Center, Chairman; D.C. Cook, Naval Research Laboratory; G.A. Gerdin, university of Illinois; W.C. Jennings, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; R.E. McCoskey, Harry Diamond Laboratories; and R.F. Shea, at large, members. The findings and recommendations of this committee are summarized in two parts; general recommendations for a new IEEE Code of Ethics, and a second part detailing the defects of the present code. This report represents a consensus of the entire AdHoc Committee. This report has been endorsed by the NPSS AdCom in its meeting on November 20, 1975. It is the intention of the chairman of this committee to submit this report to TAB, CSIT, and the IEEE board of directors for action. If action is not forthcoming, these recommendations may be aired in the CSIT Newsletter and/or in the letters column of the IEEE Spectrum and may form the basis for future unilateral action by the NPSS."

"I favor establishing field awards not only for Public Interest Service, but for Professional Activities. But I think your question does not go far enough. Since IEEE is legally constituted as a dual purpose (technical and professional) organization, I believe IEEE ought to have an equal number of its major awards (Medal of Honor, etc.) devoted to non-technical endeavors. Moreover, it is time IEEE elevated members to the rank of Fellow in recognition of their professional activities. Indeed, I spoke to members of IEEE's Awards Committee about this at headquarters this past spring. At my urging, the Board of Directors has asked Nathan Cohn (IEEE's Fellows Committee) to look into expand-panding the scope of the Fellows awards."
"Up until about 60 years ago, there were only three basic theories under which to sue for a personal injury stemming from a product or service sold by the defendant: negligence, res ipsa loquitor and deceit."
"Reviewed by HARRY SCHWARZLANDER, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Syracuse University."
"I must take issue with several statements in your March 1976, editorial. It does not follow that because I advocate the development of nuclear power that I am an advocate of the arms race, nor that I advocate wasteful consumption. I believe that the mining of uranium ore and the ultimate disposal of radioactive wastes imposes less of an exploitive burden on the earth than the available practical option, which is the consumption of fossil fuels. I most resent the statement, \"… nuclear power proponents unquestioningly and without discussion assume…\" I personally find the evidence that electric energy consumption will increase to be persuasive. I did not arrive at that conclusion without question or discussion, and I cannot believe that the thousands of engineers who share my view are the naive, sophomoric technologists your statement implies."
"In 1975 the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) submitted to the President and the Congress a report entitled A National Plan for Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration: Creating Energy Choices for the Future (ERDA-48). It was recognized that such a plan is not static but will be modified by newly discovered energy supplies, changes in energy policy, scientific successes and failures, economic conditions, actual progress in introducing new technologies, and other circumstances. As a consequence, ERDA intends to report annually on progress in the preceding year and to revise its plan annually."
"A presidential campaign is a fine spectacle. If it is no more than that, for whatever reasons, it is time to ask why. When the republic was being arranged, the Federalist papers burrowed deeply into regions of political thought and meanings. Nearly two centuries later, the ordained rhythms of politics seem an end in themselves, concerned with a transition of parties and power but not a transition of reason or purpose. It is a troubling curtain raiser on our third century."

"Attempts to identify the `core' primary journals in the newly emerging discipline of computer science. Two measures of significance have been used to draw up a core list of journals: Productivity in terms of the number of source items drawn from each journal for review in a secondary journal (Computer Reviews); and extent of use, as reflected by the frequency with which the journals are cited in a leading primary journal (IEEE Transactions on Computers) over a period of two years. This study has shown that the primary journal is the most favored medium for scholarly communication, and that computer science journal literature has consolidated into a relatively few very productive and highly cited primary journals. These core journals are indispensable in any specialized collection of computer science literature."
"The process of revising a technical or scientific paper can be performed more efficiently by the people involved (author, co-author, supervisor, editor) when the revision is controlled by breaking it into a series of steps. The revision process recommended is based on the levels-of-edit concept that resulted from a study of the technical editorial function at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. Types of revision discussed are substantive, policy, language, mechanical style, format, integrity, and copy clarification."
"Engineering managers and supervisors who have to edit reports written by other engineers often feel uncomfortable because English is not their area of particular competence. They can ease their editing burden-and, coincidentally, their engineers' writing task-if they set clear guidelines before writing begins. The most important is identifying the reader. Others are: identifying the purpose; deciding on writing style and method of presentation; and establishing a writing/editing schedule. If managers then approach the editing task prudently, so that rather than arbitrarily changing words themselves they encourage their engineer-writers to make revisions, they will quickly establish good writer/editor rapport. More-they will discover that their editing role is really a training function. Their aim as managers should be to train their engineers to become better report writers who require less and less editorial supervision."

"PENNTAP-the Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program-is a statewide scientific and technical information dissemination network. In ten years of developing and refining its technology transfer system, PENNTAP has learned that individualized information delivery is essential to successful technology transfer. PENNTAP provides this individualized service, assisting clients in interpretation and application of the information as well as delivering it to them. With the quantity of scientific and technical information doubling every eight years, it is impossible for any one person to keep up with all new information that might have application to an area of concern. PENNTAP enables organizations to obtain information that is both current and relevant to their needs by delivering existing knowledge to those who can use it for the expressed purpose of producing results."
"The traditional preoccupation with `correctness' and `clarity' in technical writing frequently goes hand in hand with a neglect of the reader's point of view which results in publications of such poor quality that instead of admiring them one should consider them unacceptable. Robert Pirsig's `Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' includes an exploration of this problem and a reexamination of the relationship between `objectivity' and quality."
"Starting a journal is a challenging experience involving many steps and decisions. This article describes how to start a journal by reviewing the steps one goes through to produce the first issue, including finding articles, setting format and style, arranging for composition and printing, and then distributing copies. Each of the steps has cost and quality implications that are reviewed."
"The typesetting of mathematics requires consistency and high quality, which has formerly meant high labor costs and long production schedules. OCR devices, computers, and CRT phototypesetters can provide a low-cost, high-speed alternative to labor-intensive metal typesetting when they are coupled to an adequate software system. The software must encompass the many complex, though precisely definable, rules for math setting and an easy-to-learn, labor-efficient input language. This paper describes such a system, currently in use, including hardware, the logic and assumptions of the software, and examples of the input language."

"We describe an optical apparatus designed and built to extend conventional light-scattering measurements to the very-small-angle regime. The present instrument covers the angular range 0.003° ≦ θ ≦ 0.15° with an instrumental resolution (hwhm) of 0.00045° (1.6 arc seconds), and exhibits an exceptionally low stray-light background. The theoretical and practical considerations important in achieving this performance are analyzed in detail. Besides its primary purpose of studying long-wave-length (0.01 cm to 1 cm) thermally driven fluctuations, the present type of apparatus should also prove quite useful in other areas where long-wave-length perturbations must be probed, such as, (i) holographic and optical memory imaging, (ii) surface roughness testing, and (iii) index of refraction profiling."
"We present an exact description of scattering of an incident plane wave with te-polarization at an interface between two dielectric media that is deformed by a grating with triangularly shaped teeth. The theory employs an expansion in plane waves outside of the grating region and describes the field in the grating region as a double Fourier series expansion. The results of this theory are represented graphically. That blazing provides substantial discrimination of the scattering process in favor of beams scattered into one or the other of the two media is shown. The exact theory is used to check an approximation for the effective reflection plane that is useful for future applications of the theory to scattering by gratings of guided waves in thin-film waveguides."
"Tests have been conducted at Bell Laboratories within the last 10 years to obtain subjective evaluations of the effects of loss, noise, and talker echo on telephone transmission quality. We use these subjective test results to formulate graphical and analytical models of subjective opinion that can be used in network planning studies to evaluate transmission performance of the network and to study the effects of network changes on performance. These models are based on the concept of a generalized transmission-rating scale. Separate opinion curves for each test take into account differences caused by factors such as subject group, type of test, and range of conditions. We also describe the methods of data analysis used in the formulation of the transmission-rating scale and opinion models, provide a comparison of the test results with the models, and discuss the models in sufficient detail to permit their application in transmission planning studies."
"This paper discusses several manipulations of lpc (linear predictive coding) parameters for providing speech encryption. Specifically, the paper considers temporal rearrangement or scrambling of the lpc code sequence, as well as the alternative of perturbing individual samples in the sequence by means of pseudo-random additive or multiplicative noise. The latter approach is believed to have greater encryption potential than the temporal scrambling technique, in terms of the time needed to “break the secrecy code.” The encryption techniques are assessed on the basis of perceptual experiments, as well as by means of a quantitative assessment of speech-spectrum distortion, as given by an appropriate “distance” measure."
"In a previous paper, we discussed estimation of the parameters of a single tone from a finite number of noisy discrete-time observations. In this paper, we extend the discussion to include several tones. The Cramér-Rao bounds are derived and their properties examined. Estimation algorithms are discussed and characterized."
"We generalize the concept of rearrangeability to a finer measure of the connecting power of a network, called the c-rearrangeability function. It can be interpreted as the proportion of calls a network guarantees to connect under a given traffic load. We study the c-rearrangeability function for many well-known rearrangeable networks, including one-sided rearrangeable, two-sided rearrangeable, as well as several other kinds. We also give constructions for some new classes of networks, study their c-rearrangeability functions, and describe conditions under which the networks are rearrangeable. We show that these newly constructed rearrangeable networks compare favorably with the well-known ones with respect to the number of crosspoints."
"A fixed-point algorithm has been used to obtain the parameters (i.e., decision and representative levels) of an “optimum” quantizer that minimizes a quite general distortion measure, subject to an entropy constraint on its output. Construction of the algorithm starts with a point-to-set mapping whose fixed point satisfies the well-known Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions necessary for a local extremum. A computer program is then used to determine a fixed point of this mapping. Several examples are solved, and correspondence with the existing results in the literature is pointed out. Finally, as conjectured, the growth of the computations as a function of dimensionality n (n: number of representative levels) is found to be of the form a · nb where a is a positive constant and 1.5 ≦ b ≦ 2.0."
  "This paper is an introduction to a series of detailed technical articles that describe the remreed switching network for No. 1 and No. 1A ess. The developmental background, technological advances, design constraints and guidelines, objectives, advantages and status of the remreed network are outlined."
"The development of the remreed sealed contact is described with emphasis on the various problems that had to be solved to get a viable manufactured product. The necessary characteristics of the switchable reed material and the unique features of the material processing and contact processing steps are discussed. Details are then presented of the selection of hard gold as a contact material and the problems encountered in its application by electroplating. The contact assembly operation is described, and the difficulties encountered at this stage are elaborated on. Finally, the physical design and testing of the contact are discussed, along with the interactions among contact geometry material properties, processing steps, test parameters, and performance."
"This paper describes a series of new two-wire matrix switches that have been developed for No. 1 ess remreed networks. These switches utilize the new 238A sealed contact, are designed to maximize the use of automatic manufacturing techniques, and typically contain twice the number of crosspoints as conventional ferreed switches. However, as a result of increasing the crosspoint packing density, the new remreed switches consume less frame area and total volume than their ferreed counterparts. In addition to the increase in the number of crosspoints, the new switches also contain many semiconductor devices required in the control scheme adopted for No. 1 ess remreed networks. The extensive use of printed-wiring boards to interconnect the individual crosspoints facilitated the mounting of semiconductor components within the switch, thus yielding a natural integration of the crosspoints and the devices used to control them. A total of seven switch codes have been developed to produce No. 1 ess line link and trunk link networks. The manufacture of these switches has been simplified by achieving a high degree of commonality among the piece parts used to produce each code."
"The new remreed network was designed to reduce the cost and the size of the No. 1 ess network. It uses a new self-latching sealed contact and a new switch-package design. This new package includes components directly related to the control of the switch. Remreed network control, the subject of this paper, is all electronic. It uses a mixture of silicon integrated circuits and discrete circuits to accomplish its control functions. The network topology and modularity has not been changed. The design was undertaken with the goal of complete compatibility with all existing system programs, including fault-recognition and diagnostic programs. This has permitted the addition of remreed networks to existing No. 1 ess offices with no program changes or modification of ferreed networks. The resulting remreed-ferreed mix is operated and maintained by the same software. The new network offers reduced manufacturing costs, simplified installation, improved reliability and maintainability, and a 3:1 to 4:1 space reduction."
"A new line scanner design was undertaken as part of the No. 1 ess remreed network development. The new design reduces frame and unit wiring, improves maintenance, lowers manufacturing cost, and occupies less space. The new scanner has been designed to be completely compatible with all existing No. 1 ess system programs to permit its use in growth applications as well as in new machines."
"Five new switching frames have been designed for use in No. 1 and No. 1A ess central offices. These new frames utilize the recently developed remreed sealed contact and are equipped with electronic network controllers. The new remreed switching frames occupy approximately one-quarter the floor space required for the ferreed switching frames that they replace. Other design features include improved maintainability, reduced installation interval, and reduced cost. This paper describes some of the more significant physical design features incorporated in these five new frame designs."
"The transmission characteristics of remreed networks have been designed to support a wide variety of switched services. These include local- and toll-switched voice-message and voiceband data services. Also, looking toward the future, the remreed network has the capability of supporting wideband services such as analog Picturephone® service and T1 bit streams. In a class of space-division networks, it approaches being an ideal noninteractive extension of the switching-office cabling. This article discusses the transmission and environmental protection aspects of remreed networks. The objectives and requirements used to control the transmission and protection design for remreed networks are given and the resulting performance characteristics are described."
"The performance evaluation of the remreed switching network begins with a study of failure modes of the remreed contact and ends with a discussion of results from a field study. Remreed contact-reliability test results show low early failure rates due to high contact resistance and contact sticking. High contact resistance, which characterizes the wear-out mode of failure, is discussed. Remreed switch evaluation results are given. Finally, early field performance of the remreed switching network is assessed in a study using in-service trunk link networks as the source of data."
  "This year the United States is celebrating the bicentennial of its founding 200 years of change, crises, and invention. At the beginning of the nation's second century, in March 1876, the “speaking telephone” was invented. With it began 100 years of research and development in telecommunications a technology whose influence on the growth of the nation and, indeed, of all western nations, has been profound. The continual improvement and expansion of telecommunications has depended on the depth and diversity of technical research and development. And, if research and development is to encompass all the economic and physical requirements of a growing telecommunications system, it must be founded upon an active exchange of ideas."
"It has long been known that an electro-magnet gives forth a decided sound when it is suddenly magnetized or demagnetized. When the circuit upon which it is placed is rapidly made and broken, a succession of explosive noises proceeds from the magnet. These sounds produce upon the ear the effect of a musical note, when the current is interrupted a sufficient number of times per second. The discovery of “Galvanic Music,” by Page,* in 1837, led inquirers in different parts of the world almost simultaneously to enter into the field of telephonic research; and the acoustical effects produced by magnetization were carefully studied by Marrian, †Beatson, ‡Gassiot,§DelaRive,|| Matteucci,* Guillemin,† Wertheim,‡ Wartmann,§ Janniar,|| Joule,¶ Laborde,** Legat,‡‡Reis,‡‡Poggendorff,§§ Du Moncel, || || Delezenne,¶¶ and others.***"
"Using the paraxial ray approximation, simple formulas for the cross polarization introduced by curved reflectors are developed. In particular, when the reflectors are quadric surfaces of revolution with the center ray of the beam passing through the foci, the maximum cross-polarized field amplitude throughout a gaussian beam, relative to the on-axis copolarized field, is $C = {2\\xi\\kappa\\bot\\over \\sqrt{e}}\\sin \\theta_{i},$ where e is the base of the natural logarithm, ξ is the 1/e power radius of the beam, ki is the curvature of the reflector perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and θi is the angle of incidence. For such reflectors, the beam fields are accurately represented by a superposition of just two gaussian modes for each plane of polarization: the fundamental mode, which corresponds to the co-polarized gaussian beam, and a higher-order mode, which accounts for the cross-polarized field and the amplitude “space” taper. Transformation of a beam through a general sequence of such reflectors is influenced by three factors: the curved reflectors, longitudinal propagation lengths, and rotations of the plane of incidence. The effect of each factor is described by a 4 × 4 matrix relating the input and output gaussian modes. Several typical beam-reflector systems are analyzed by this method. Theoretical cross-polarization patterns are shown to be in accurate agreement with measurements on a symmetrical dual-reflector system."
"In this paper, we describe a novel receiver structure for two-dimensional-modulated, suppressed-carrier data signals. The receiver consists of a passband equalizer followed by a demodulator which compensates for frequency offset and phase jitter; the demodulator's phase angle is provided by a data-directed, carrier recovery loop, which is shown by analysis and simulation to be capable of tracking relatively high frequency phase jitter. A derivation of the receiver parameters is presented, based on a gradient algorithm for jointly optimizing the equalizer tap coefficients and the carrier phase estimate, to minimize the output mean-squared error. System performance is related to carrier phase-tracking parameters by analysis. Computer simulations confirm the feasibility of the receiver structure."
"We calculate the potential of a line charge embedded in a dielectric medium of permittivity ∊2 in the presence of a dielectric wedge of permittivity ∊1. The potential is calculated with the aid of the Mellin transform, and the answer is given as a definite integral which is then transformed into an infinite series. We show that, for all wedge angles and all ratios ∊2/∊1, ∇φ is singular at the tip of the wedge, and we give the strength of the singularity. The results have relevance to the design of contacts on semiconductor devices."
"In this paper we reexamine results of a previous paper1 in which the capacity of the continuous-time channel with bandwidth W, average signal power P0, and additive gaussian noise with flat spectral density N0 was shown to be approximately W In (1 + P0/N0W) under a number of physically consistent assumptions. When one of the models in Ref. 1 is modified by techniques suggested by Slepian in his 1974 Shannon Lecture,2 the channel capacity turns out to be exactly W In (1 + P0/N0W)."
"A number of problems are considered relevant to understanding the performance of optical-fiber communication systems that use pulse transmission. The methods used are typically exact solutions or bounds, and we concentrate on simple examples that aid our understanding. Some of our work makes contact with previous studies, particularly by Personick and Hubbard. The major results are: (i) Presentation of an integral equation for the output density for single-pulse detection with arbitrary avalanche gain (ii) Exact solution for the probability distribution for gains in physical avalanche diodes (iii) Bounds on performance when intersymbol interference is present (but no avalanche gain) which suggest that an optimum-bit detector can perform, under practical conditions, only two or three dB better than a simple integrate-and-dump filter, yielding results still many dB from the quantum limit. Thus, in particular, little performance gain is to be expected from equalization techniques."
 "The optical fiber drawing process is considered in its totality–from source to forming zone to draw-down region and take-up end–as a problem in fluid dynamics. Fiber drawing of most glasses is dominated by viscous stresses, surface tension effects, and quenching rates. This contrasts with the drawing of textile fibers, where other fluid properties and non-Newtonian effects can play important roles. Preliminary time-in-variant “base flow” models are developed for glass drawing, using the one-dimensional, small-slope approximation of extensional flow. First-order sensitivities of these base flows to changes in operating conditions are examined via a stability analysis. Two important instability mechanisms, denoted as the tensile and capillary modes of dynamic fiber response, are discussed. Several follow-on objectives arising from this study are described."
"An injection-molded plastic splice connector for splicing optical cables has been fabricated and evaluated. Five optical cables containing 90-µm od graded-index fibers with 55-µm core diameters were spliced, yielding an average splice loss of 0.20 dB for the 425 splice joints measured. Fifty percent of the losses measured were less than 0.1 dB and 95 percent of the splice joints had losses less than 0.8 dB. Assembly methods for splicing optical cables using this connector and a multiribbon optical-fiber cutting tool capable of cutting 144 fibers simultaneously are also described."
"A rationale is advanced for digitally coding speech signals in terms of sub-bands of the total spectrum. The approach provides a means for controlling and reducing quantizing noise in the coding. Each sub-band is quantized with an accuracy (bit allocation) based upon perceptual criteria. As a result, the quality of the coded signal is improved over that obtained from a single full-band coding of the total spectrum. In one implementation, the individual sub-bands are low-pass translated before coding. In another, “integer-band” sampling is employed to alias the signal in an advantageous way before coding. Other possibilities extend to complex demodulation of the sub-bands, and to representing the sub-band signals in terms of envelopes and phase-derivatives. In all techniques, adaptive quantization is used for the coding, and a parsimonious allocation of bits is made across the bands. Computer simulations are made to demonstrate the signal qualities obtained for codings at 16 and 9.6 kb/s."
"Subjective quality ratings of pcm coded speech were obtained with the aims of (i) determining the effects of certain coder parameters and their interactions on speech quality, (ii) finding objective measures for predicting perceived distortions, and (iii) providing guidelines for optimizing coder design. Coders with various combinations of four clipping levels, seven step sizes, four bandwidths, and three logarithmic companding laws were simulated. The coders were rated for quality on a 10-point scale by 48 listeners who heard male and female speech processed by the coders. The ratings depended strongly on clipping level and step size, but only weakly on bandwidth. None of the coder parameters interacted strongly with another. Clipping noise power grossly overestimated the extent of perceived overload distortion; instead, clipping percentage is proposed as a much more realistic predictor. Signal-to-granular-noise ratio was a good predictor of perceived granular noise. For a given bit rate, the coder with the highest quality rating was not the coder with minimum total clipping and granular noise power, contrary to traditional wisdom."
"An extension of a method of Chen and Lahlum1 for estimating the distributions of high rain rates is described. Through application of the statistical theory of extremes to available yearly maximum rain-rate data, a reasonably accurate distribution is obtained. The calculated results agree well with previously obtained 20-year data. Application of this method to Weather Bureau Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves has yielded 50-year distributions of 5-minute rain rates for 36 locations in the western United States; others can be similarly obtained. Such long-term rain-rate distributions are valuable for microwave radio-path engineering, especially in the western United States where shorter-term data sources are inadequate."
"A sequence of N, independent, identically distributed, random variables is observed from one of two stable distributions with known parameters. The likelihood-ratio test for discriminating between these two distributions is found explicitly and performance limitations are determined. When the two distributions differ only in location, the likelihood-ratio test is sensitive to whether the distribution is nongaussian stable (0 < α < 2) when nonlinear soft limiting of large deviations is used, or gaussian stable (α = 2) when linear processing is used. When the two distributions differ only in scale, the likelihood-ratio test is sensitive to whether 0 < α < 2 when nonlinear soft limiting of large deviations is used, or gaussian (α = 2) when a chi-squared test is used. The analysis of the two remaining cases, distinguishing between one of two characteristic indices, and between one of two skewness parameters, parallels the analysis of distinguishing between one of two scale parameters and is only touched upon briefly."
"A sample function from one of two stable, stationary, independent-increment processes is observed for a finite time interval. For differing location, characteristic index, skewness, or scale, the probabilities measures induced by the process under either hypothesis are found to be mutually orthogonal. By suitably modifying the Lévy measure associated with each probability measure, continuous-time tests for differing characteristic indices, skewness, or scale parameters can be posed as nonsingular detection problems; distinguishing location remains a singular detection problem. For the nonsingular problems, the likelihood functional is found explicitly, and performance limitations are determined. As an alternative approach, the observed sample function is sampled at discrete time instants over a finite time interval, and the performance of log likelihood test is studied as a function of sample spacing with a fixed, total number of observations."
"Four of the Bell System digital transmission systems, T1 Outstate, T2, 3A-RDS (radio system at TS rate), and T4M, have violation monitor and removers (vmrs) located at the receiving-end maintenance offices. Among other things, they monitor the lines, remove violations in the pulse transmission code, and generate alarms to initiate maintenance actions. This paper investigates the alarm statistics of the four types of vmr under the assumption that the information bits are statistically independent. It is found that all the vmrs have very sharp alarm thresholds. The results of the T4M vmr are presented in detail. Curves are given to show the various statistics obtained."
  "The grade of service of a probability-engineered trunk group is defined to be the 20-day average blocking during the busy hour of the busy season. In this paper, an improved model for calculating grade of service is developed and used to increase the accuracy of the existing trunk-engineering procedures. Using the new model, new traffic-capacity tables and trunk-estimation algorithms have been designed for use in the Bell System."
"Two techniques are introduced for extending C. Y. Lee's method of switching network analysis to cases of toll-type networks. The methods avoid certain inconsistent independence assumptions which would otherwise be a source of inaccuracies. One method partitions the Lee graph in a special way, while the other uses a lemma that characterizes the generating function of an average network property. Examples are worked for three-stage networks and a model of the No. 4 ess."
"This paper describes the development and use of a test facility for a computer-based store-and-forward message-switching system. The test facility provides a close approximation to actual operating environments, allowing the system to be tested in a realistic environment. The facility provides a vehicle for many essential system studies including performance monitoring and measurement, load testing, certification, and validation of various simulation and forecasting models. A wide range of tools is used in this facility–hardware and software monitors, terminal and network simulators, and data reduction and analysis packages. One version of the system is used to drive and thus test another version. A language for creating a set of test data is defined and is used to present various parameters to the switching system."
"The possibility that excessive crosstalk limits the application of gain to long voice-frequency loops was studied. This problem was examined by means of a probability model incorporating data on such random variables as activity coincidence of disturbing and disturbed subscribers, disturber volume level, coupling path loss, listener acuity, and various noise sources. A new approach was used with regard to the probability distributions of random variables: the probability distributions were modelled in detail for the calculation of the necessary functions, sums, and functions of sums of random variables. Results showed that gain of 6 dB or less is acceptable, and 9 dB is unjustifiably excessive. The approach used provides the most accurate calculation possible with available data, and is anticipated to be convenient not only for similar crosstalk evaluations but also for other nongaussian probability problems."
"Transverse offset and angular misalignment (tilt) are serious causes of loss in multimode fiber splices. Our computation of these losses in multimode graded-index fibers reveals that the loss depends strongly on the power distribution in the fiber. We find that offsets of 0.1 of the core radius (or tilts of 0.1 of the fiber numerical aperture) cause a loss of 0.1 dB in the case of steady-state conditions, and between 0.34 and 0.38 dB if the power distribution is assumed as uniform. We compare these results with measured offset loss values and conclude that the steady-state distribution better reflects transmission line conditions than the uniform distribution."
"A geometrical optics model is presented that is based on defining a local numerical aperture as a function of fiber radius with a uniform power distribution. Transmission vs transverse offset characteristics for parabolic-profile fiber splices are calculated for unequal fiber-core diameters. We show that the often-used assumptions of equal-mode excitation, equal-mode attenuation, and no-mode coupling are not adequate to calculate realistic transmission vs offset characteristics. Splice-loss measurements with long fiber lengths on each side of the splice show less than the calculated sensitivity to small offsets and greater than the calculated sensitivity to large offsets."
"Laminated fiber ribbon (lamfir) exhibits mechanical properties of a composite structure and is strong enough to withstand the stresses of cable fabrication. Laminating parameters have been adjusted to make the lamfir relatively easy to separate for accessing the fibers. Optical properties of lamfir have been characterized, so that trade-offs between numerical apertures (na), cladding thickness/core diameter (t/d), and additional loss are given for uncoated, step-profile fibers and one set of laminating conditions. Larger values of t/d than originally expected are desirable due to the bends in the fiber axes."
"We present formulas for the microbending losses of fibers that are caused by random deflections of the fiber axis. We consider single-mode (or almost single-mode), step-index fibers and multimode, parabolic-index fibers and compare their losses. Loss formulas for the single-mode fiber are derived from coupled-mode theory using radiation modes. Simple empirical approximations of the general formulas are also presented. The losses of the parabolic-index, multimode fiber have been derived earlier. The losses of both fiber types are compared by assuming either that each fiber samples the spatial Fourier spectrum of the distortion function at the same spatial frequency, or by comparing typical fibers of each type with each other regardless of any similarity between them. It is found that the multimode, parabolic-index fiber has lower losses if it supports a sufficient number of guided modes."
"This paper compares the performances of equalising and nonequalizing repeaters in optical fiber systems in the presence of delay distortion leading to intersymbol interference on the received optical pulse stream. Curves of receiver sensitivity loss vs delay distortion are computed for nonequalising repeaters for various received optical pulse shapes. These results are then compared to previously published results for equalizing receivers. The results indicate that for modest delay distortion (less than 5 dB of receiver sensitivity loss) there are no significant advantages of the equalising receiver over the nonequalizing type."
"A modulation and detection scheme for applying derivative techniques to the investigation of stripe geometry (Al, Ga)As double-heterostructure lasers is described. Modulating at constant modulation index allows the quantities I(dV/dI) and I2(d2V /dI2) to be directly obtained in the same apparatus at the first and second harmonic of the modulation frequency, respectively. Particularly strong indications of laser action and other optical interactions in the laser are contained in the second harmonic voltage response. The same apparatus may be used to obtain derivatives of the light-current relation. These are found to sensitively reveal light-current nonlinearities that are believed caused by filaments and other spatial inhomogeneities and instabilities."
"With z. a signal process, w. a Brownian motion, and yt = ∫0t zsds + wt, a noisy observation, the innovations problem is to determine whether y. is adapted to the innovations process v., which is also a Brownian motion, and is defined using the estimate $\\hat {z}_t = E\\{z_{t}\\vert y_{s}, 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\}$ by $y_{t} = ∫_{0}^{t} \\hat {z}_{s}ds + v_{t}$. The closely related σ-algebras problem in stochastic DEs is to determine, for a given causal drift α, when a solution of dξ = α(t, ξ)dt + dw is a causal functional of w. Previous results on these problems are reviewed and extended. In particular, we broach and answer positively the physically important case of the innovations problem in which the signal satisfies a stochastic de with drift depending in part on the noisy observations. This case is important because it models a system observed through noise and controlled by feedback of these noisy observations. The last part of the paper shows that the innovations problem has a positive resolution if and only if on some probability space there is a Brownian motion W and a causal solution ξ of dξ = α(t, ξ)dt + dW, where α expresses the estimator $\\hat z;$ that is, α is a causal functional such that $\\hat z_{t} = α(t, y)$."
  "Classical tone detectors use narrow bandpass filters to isolate tones. A comparison of a filter's output power against the total input signal power determines whether or not a particular tone is present. This paper considers an alternate method for tone detection. It is based on estimating the first three moments of the signal's band-limited power spectrum. These three moments (zeroth, first, and second) measure the power, power mean frequency, and RMS power bandwidth, respectively, of the signal. If these three moments are available, it is easy to deduce whether or not a tone is present. Since the estimators have a simple digital implementation, this approach should have economic advantages in many applications."
"Hong and Patel have described an efficient error-correcting code for magnetic tape, which has been successfully used on the IBM 6250 bits-per-inch nine-track magnetic tape units. This paper gives a simple description of the code, without using Galois fields."
"An experimental 10-W, three-stage, GaAs IMPATT amplifier has been developed with transmission characteristics suitable for use in 6-GHz long-haul radio-relay systems. The amplifier uses five flat-doping-profile GaAs IMPATT diodes in three cascaded, circulator-coupled stages. The dc input power is 153 W with a nominal 10 W of output power and an overall noise figure of less than 35 dB. The overall amplifier efficiency is 6.5 percent. The major portion of the amplifier is constructed in strip transmission line using suspended alumina substrate in an aluminum housing. Small, integrated, coaxial sections with coaxial transformers connect the diodes to the strip transmission line circuits. The amplifier is cooled by free convection."
"The processor in an electronic telephone switching system must be designed to efficiently and reliably process telephone calls. Because of the extended life span of a telephone switching system and the nature of the function it provides, it is advantageous to build a great deal of flexibility into the processor design. This paper provides details of a microprogram control design philosophy for the development of a medium-size processor∗ that provides the required flexibility. The aspects of the microprogram control that make it very suitable for the design of a processor in a fault-tolerant system are also described."
"This paper presents some basic equations for predicting the maximum temperature rise at an isolated constriction in a current-carrying printed conductor. The equations apply to general configurations of printed conductors, since they are based on the heat equation in the steady state. A variety of numerical results concerning the maximum temperature rise and the runaway or critical current are presented in tables for the case of printed conductors of nominal widths 8, 25, and 100 mils. The numerical results include the case of 1-, 2-, and 3-oz copper conductors at an ambient temperature of 20 or 50°C. A few experimental results are presented which show that the numerical results concerning the maximum temperature rise are conservative from the point of view of design. The results are useful for determining whether an isolated constriction in a printed conductor is of any significance. Also, the results can be used to help develop rational criteria for rejecting printed conductors when isolated nicks are present."
 "We study the steady-state loss of a fiber with random, nearest-neighbor coupling and compare it with the mode with the lowest loss of a cavity formed from a section of the same type of fiber. We find that the loss of the cavity is not identical with the loss of the steady-state distribution of the fiber with random coupling. In fact, fiber and fiber resonator behave very differently if the fiber mode of highest order is made very lossy. The loss of the steady-state distribution of the fiber with random, nearest-neighbor coupling approaches a weighted average of the losses of its individual modes plus a contribution from the coupling coefficient that couples the highest-order mode to its neighbors. The cavity loss, on the other hand, becomes independent of the coupling coefficients and of the loss of the highest-order mode, provided this loss becomes much higher than the coupling strength. This behavior leads us to conclude that the loss of the cavity is a weighted average of the losses of all those modes whose coupling strength exceeds their (individual, uncoupled) loss coefficients. Two resonator modes with propagation constants β1 and β2 remain uncoupled unless they satisfy the condition β1 − β2 = 2πn/L, where n is an integer and L is twice the length of the resonator."
"We present an approximate theory of loss coefficients for modes of step-index fibers with various types of distortions and for fibers with lossy claddings. The fiber irregularities are assumed to be sinusoidal and random variations of the core-cladding interface. Formulas for the loss coefficients are presented and plotted for different values of the compound mode number M. For fiber lasers, we plot the loss coefficients as functions of the mirror tilt angles. We consider as an example a Nd-YAG fiber laser with refractive index n1 = 1.8 and a core radius of a = 40 µm operating at a wavelength of λ = 1.06 µm. For this example, we find that radiation losses are caused by Fourier components of fiber irregularities in the spatial wavelength range between 0.4 and 1.3 µm. Intrinsic losses may be as low as 2α = 10−3 cm−1. It is thus desirable to limit scattering losses to values below 10−3 cm−1. This requirement imposes tolerance restrictions of 0.01 µm on the permissible core radius fluctuations. For core radius fluctuations of this order of magnitude, mirror tilts should not exceed approximately 5 degrees. Cladding losses are not critical, but their influence on laser losses depends on the refractive index ratio of the core and cladding materials. Tolerable cladding losses may range from 10 to 300 cm−1."
"A novel technique for measuring the refractive index profile of optical fibers is demonstrated, which offers substantial advantages over alternative methods. The method consists of illuminating a small area of the fiber core and measuring the total transmitted power. The transmission of leaky modes is accounted for in the manner reported previously by other authors. The index profiles of germanium-doped fibers obtained by this technique are compared to interferometric measurements. The resolution is shown to be limited by wave optics effects to about λo(4n√2Δ)−1, where Δ ≡ Δn/n. The distortion of the index profile as the wavelength varies and wave-optics effects are investigated."
"A newly developed technique for directly measuring fiber dispersion in the frequency domain as a function of wavelength is described. Spectrally filtered white light from a xenon arc lamp is sinusoidally modulated in the range 0 to 1 GHz by an electrooptic modulator and injected into a fiber. The procedure is to vary the modulation frequency and measure the corresponding sideband output power with a photomultiplier and spectrum analyzer. Ratio measurements between the test fiber and a short reference fiber give the baseband frequency response. A number of germanium- and boron-doped fibers have been examined. The least dispersive borosilicate graded-index fiber has a 1 dB bandwidth of 1 GHz, after 1.07 km of propagation at λ = 908 nm. The width broadens gradually with increasing wavelengths up to λ = 1100 nm."
"The concentricity and uniformity of nearly concentric transparent plastic coatings extruded onto optical fibers are determined by a sensitive, nondestructive optical technique. The method is based on the location of unique fringes in the backscattered light arising from a beam that is incident at right angles to the fiber's axis. Results from both uniform and distorted coatings are shown, and instrumentation suitable for on-line coating diagnosis and correction is presented."
"This paper describes some techniques for efficient coding of two-tone (black and white) facsimile pictures. These techniques use the two-dimensional correlation present in spatially close picture elements to change the relative order of transmission of elements in a scan line. This ordering increases the average length of the runs of consecutive black or white elements in the ordered line, making the data more amenable to one-dimensional run-length coding. We describe several variations of the ordering scheme, which differ in complexity and coding efficiency and evaluate their coding efficiency. For a variety of 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch typed documents, road maps, and circuit diagrams scanned with 200 lines/inch, these techniques reduce the bit rate by 30 to 50 percent over and above the one-dimensional run-length coding along a scan line; for single-spaced typed material with 100 lines/inch, this reduction is about 25 percent. We compare one of our techniques with a two-dimensional compression technique recently proposed by Preuss. We show that our technique results in an entropy about 10 to 18 percent lower than that obtainable through Preuss' technique."
"A measurement approach is described which provides the capability of detecting traffic congestion in the graded multiples of a step-by-step switching system. The basic idea is to measure the load carried on the last trunk of each graded multiple and, using the techniques described, to determine the congestion level in each grading. The method, which requires only one lead per grading, works because Bell System grading patterns, which differ in structure depending on size, all have a common last-choice trunk and because the load carried on the last-choice trunk increases as the congestion in a grading increases. The basic idea and the interpretation of last-trunk-usage data in the presence of day-to-day variations in the offered load for configurations with and without rotary out-trunk switches are described in detail. Last-trunk-usage measurements are compared with other possible traffic measurements on gradings in terms of effectiveness in detecting various service impairments. The statistical accuracy of load and blocking estimates from last-trunk-usage measurements is also discussed. The result is a simple, effective measurement technique with the combined advantage of rapid detection of gradings with service problems and relative ease of implementation."
  "N. S. Jayant has proposed a simple but effective form of adaptive delta modulation which uses two positive parameters, P and Q, to adjust the step size. The values P = Q = 1 describe linear delta modulation (LDM), and Jayant has recommended using Q = 1/P and 1 < P < 2. In this paper, we study the step response of this scheme for arbitrary P and Q. For each P and Q, we are able to define an integer n, the stability exponent for P and Q, such that the step response is unstable when PnQ > 1, it converges to the new level when PnQ < 1, and when PnQ = 1, it eventually settles into a periodic (2n + 2)-step cycle, for almost all initial conditions. For P ≧ 2, and for some combinations of P and Q with P between 1.6 and 2, it is possible to have both PQ < 1 and PnQ ≧ 1, so that PQ < 1 is not sufficient for convergence. When a system is convergent, but a minimum step size δ is imposed, the eventual periodic hunting will not necessarily resemble that of LDM, but will be bounded by δPn."
"In this paper, the problem is discussed of designing a signal other than the standard impulse function to be used to test a digital system of limited dynamic range. The constraints on such a signal are that it must be all-pass, of limited duration (approximately), and peak-amplitude-limited so as to utilize the limited dynamic range of the system as far as possible. Stated another way, the goal is to spread out the energy in the signal as much as possible to reduce its peak amplitude and therefore to be able to pass higher energy signals through the system without clipping them. The class of all-pass signals (obtained as the impulse response of a variable order all-pass filter) was investigated for use as the test signal. The parameters of the all-pass filter of a given order were optimized to give an all-pass signal whose peak amplitude was the smallest possible. Filter orders from first to eighth order were designed and investigated. It was found that reductions in the peak signal level of up to 11.2 dB (relative to the signal level of an equivalent energy impulse) could be obtained for an eighth-order all-pass signal. Interpolated versions of these all-pass signals showed that the peak value of the interpolated waveform was only on the order of 6 dB. Thus, the use of an all-pass signal, rather than the standard impulse, for testing a digital system can result in about 1 bit extra dynamic range."
"A two-dimensional receiver structure has been proposed, incorporating two innovations: passband equalization, which mitigates intersymbol interference, and data-directed carrier recovery and demodulation following equalization, which enables compensation of carrier frequency offset and phase jitter, but does not require transmission of a separate pilot tone with the data signal. The receiver is fully adaptive; the adjustment of the equalizer tap coefficients and of the estimate of the current channel phase shift is based on a gradient algorithm for jointly minimizing the mean squared error with respect to those parameters. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic behavior of the deterministic gradient algorithm (where channel parameters entering into the gradient expression are assumed known in advance). The corresponding estimated gradient algorithm (where these parameters are initially unknown) has previously been studied experimentally, but is not treated here. The first part of the present study concerns system start-up (or transient) response when the channel's phase shift is fixed. Examination of the analytical solution leads to the qualitative conclusion that, if the equalizer tap adaptation coefficient β is small relative to the phase-tracking coefficient α, the added phase estimation feature does not strongly affect the start-up behavior of the passband equalizer under typical operating conditions. Indeed, if the equalizer tap coefficients all start at zero, their evolution in the deterministic gradient algorithm is completely unaffected by the phase-tracking loop. The second situation analyzed is the steady-state response of the system to a constant carrier frequency offset. In this case, the phase-tracking loop is found to reduce the resulting rate of rotation of the equalizer taps to about β/(α + β) of the original frequency offset. As a result, the degradation in system mean squared error due to frequency offset is typically quite small. The final analysis is of the response of a linearized version of the receiver structure to sinusoidal phase jitter. When the channel's linear"
"The spectral or band occupancy of an RF signal is often defined as the bandwidth that contains a specified fraction (usually 99 percent) of the modulated RF power. The band occupancy of binary and quaternary PSK signals with and without RF filtering and with modulation pulses of several shapes has been evaluated and the results presented in graphical and tabular form. For a binary FSK signal with phase deviation of ± π/2, sometimes called an FM-PSK signal, numerical values of the spectral occupancy with rectangular and raised-cosine signaling have been obtained and the results given in graphical form. For a binary PSK signal with signaling rate 1/T and with arbitrary baseband pulse shaping, we have derived a lower bound on the fraction of the continuous power contained outside any given band, but have not been able to get a bound on the total band occupancy. However, for an FM-PSK signal, a lower bound on the total band occupancy has been derived, and it is shown that the value of this lower bound for 99-percent power occupancy is 1.117/T. The 99-percent power occupancy bandwidth of an FM-PSK signal is 1.170/T with rectangular signaling and 2.20/T with raised-cosine signaling."
"A Touch-Tone® receiver with cyclotomic digital channel filters introduced in a companion paper is presented in this paper. A comparison with standard digital channel filters reveals that the number of additions per second needed to implement the channel filters is significantly reduced using cyclotomic filters. The performance of cyclotomic filters as a function of their period is presented in graphic form. The results presented here simulating the filter with random inputs indicates that the filters can effectively reject non-Touch-Tone signals. Sensitivity of some important criteria as a function of the accuracy of the clock used to control the digital filters is summarized. The results show that the filters are not particularly sensitive to nonaccurate clocks."
"A class of digital, linear generator-detectors, based upon cyclotomic polynomials, which have simple implementation and operate without roundoff errors, is proposed. It is shown how these filters are optimal among all linear generator-detectors which have no roundoff required in the feedback loop. The complexity of various cyclotomic filters are compared. These filters in general require far fewer binary adds/ s than conventional second-order filters used for the same purpose."
  "A review of the current VIA Net Loss plan was made using a simulation model of the transmission characteristics of telephone connections. This model allowed the determination of the optimal loss which balanced the degradation due to talker echo and the degradation caused by its control on primary speech. The review reaffirmed current methods with some changes to allow for the emerging digital network."
"Phase comparators used in phase-locked loops extracting symbol timing from baseband data waveforms typically only produce a useful error signal when a data transition occurs. This gating of the error signal by data transitions makes the natural model for studying jitter in such phase-locked loops time-varying and difficult to analyze. In this paper we show how, under good approximation, it can be simplified to a time-invariant model that is easily analyzed. Using this model, we study jitter accumulation along chains of digital repeaters with phase-locked-loop timing extractors. A numerical example is given."
"Under equilibrium conditions, the load carried by a service system is defined as the average amount of traffic handled per unit of time. An unbiased estimate of this parameter is provided by the switch-count load, which is obtained by recording the number of busy servers at regular time intervals and then taking the arithmetic mean of these observations. Formulas for the variance of this measurement (which are applicable to delay-and-loss systems with either finite- or infinite-source inputs and arbitrary defection rates) were derived in a previous paper1; a program for their computation is now available and has been used to explore effects of parameter changes on the switch-count load variance. The purpose of the present paper is to describe results of this investigation and, in particular, to draw attention to two properties which may be unexpected: (i) the variance of the switch-count load does not always decrease when waiting positions are added, and (ii) the variance of the carried-load estimate obtained from continuous observation over a given time interval is not a lower bound for the variance of load estimates calculated from a finite sequence of recording of the number of busy servers."
"An algorithmic procedure for designing hybrid FIR/IIR digital filters is proposed and evaluated in this paper. The design is implemented as a two-stage optimization in which a Hooke and Jeeves optimization procedure is used to optimize the IIR component of the filter and the McClellan et al. optimization procedure is used to optimize the FIR component of the filter. To evaluate this method, a set of eight low-pass filters were designed in which a single complex conjugate pole pair was used as the IIR component. The resulting designs were compared and contrasted with standard IIR low-pass filters and the optimal FIR, linear-phase, low-pass filter in terms of multiplications, storage, and group delay properties."
"The filter response of nonuniform, almost-periodic structures, such as corrugated optical waveguides, is investigated theoretically. The filter process, leading to reflection of a band of frequencies near the Bragg frequency, is treated as a contradirectional coupled-wave interaction and shown to obey a Riccati differential equation. The nonuniformity of the structure is represented by a tapering in the coupling strength (e.g., the depth of the corrugation) and by a chirp in the period of the structure. For small reflectivities, the filter response is a Fourier transform of the taper function. For large reflectivities, the Riccati equation was evaluated numerically and plots are given for the response of filters with linear and quadratic tapers and with linear and quadratic chirps."
 "This brief presents a method for estimating 5-minute rain-rate distributions based on climatological data for over 250 locations as published annually by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa). A maximized 5-minute rain-rate distribution, which is believed to be more appropriate for use in predicting rain attenuation, is also introduced."
"An important problem in designing terrestrial and earth-satellite radio systems at frequencies above 10 GHz is the radio outage caused by rain attenuation. Since rain-rate statistics vary significantly from year to year, long-term rain-rate distributions are needed in radio path engineering to meet a given reliability objective. This paper and Ref. 2 together describe a method and the necessary data sources to obtain 20-year distributions of 5-min rain rates at about 250 locations in the U. S. A."
"Two highly accurate automated network analyzers have been developed to cover the frequency ranges of 0.9 to 4.2 GHz and 3.7 to 12.4 GHz. In addition to the directly measured quantities of insertion loss and phase, the analyzers provide insertion delay, impedance, and two-port parameters as derived quantities. The functional architecture of the systems is described along with some of the novel techniques used to obtain the high signal-to-noise ratios and system stabilities needed for the precise measurements of loss, phase, and delay. General descriptions of these techniques are given along with some of the design considerations. Experimental results that demonstrate measurement accuracy are presented for one-port and two-port devices using both coaxial and waveguide connectors."
"An automatic speaker-verification system accessed by test customers from their own telephones over dialed-up lines has been evaluated. The test population consisted of over 100 male and female speakers who called up nominally once each working day over a period of five months. The operation of the system is based on a set of functions of time obtained from acoustic analysis of a fixed, sentence-long utterance. These functions are compared with stored reference functions to determine whether to accept or reject an identity claim. The system is implemented on a NOVA 800 laboratory computer. Telephone line access to the computer is via a data set hookup. Identity claims are made by keying an identification number on a Touch-Tone® dial. Instructions and responses to the customer are made by means of a programmed voice-response system. Reference data was computed off-line and updated with the analysis data of accepted utterances. The evaluation indicated an error rate of approximately 10 percent for new customers and approximately 5 percent for adapted customers."
"Simulation of repeaters for an optical-fiberguide digital-communication system requires the calculation of the statistical error rate of the signal. The calculations of these error rates are difficult because of the non-gaussian nature of the noise in the optical detector. In this paper, statistical techniques are described which are useful for simulating tails of distributions. In particular, the importance-sampling procedure is used to modify the probability densities of the input values in a way that makes simulation possible. Application of this procedure gives more accurate results in reasonable computer times. The method is applied to the calculation of the error rate of a fiberguide repeater. Realistic examples are simulated. Results compare favorably with experimental measurements. The number of samples needed for simulation was reduced by five to six orders of magnitude. An alternative numerical solution to the problem is also developed."
"We analyze an optical switch consisting of two directional couplers with an intermediate phase-compensating network. The conditional requirements on coupler length, phase mismatch between guides in each coupler, and phase compensation between couplers are established such that two switching states exist. It is shown that, to switch between states, (i) The couplers must be 3 dB or stronger. (ii) Each coupler must be “adjusted” to become a hybrid by controlling the phase mismatch between guides. (iii) The differential phase φ must be initially set to turn on one state. (iv) An additional increment of π in the phase shift causes switching to the second state. It is estimated that the controlling voltage required to activate the bipolar switch is of the order of 1 to 2 V for a 3-µm guide with 3-mm-long electrodes in Ti-diffused LiNbO3. We are currently in the process of fabricating such devices."
"We present design criteria for the construction of a modified parabolic-index fiber with intentional mode coupling. Mode coupling serves the purpose of reducing multimode pulse dispersion and is accomplished by introducing carefully designed index fluctuations into the fiber core or by controlled “random” bends of the fiber axis. Radiation losses due to mode coupling can be minimized by terminating the parabolic-index fiber core in an abrupt index discontinuity. The additional modes introduced by this step must be filtered out by periodic mode filters that consist of parabolic-index fiber sections without the refractive-index step."
"We show formally how the application of boundary layer techniques to a well-stirred, concentrated, multicomponent electrolyte yields essentially the same results as those for a dilute, binary electrolyte. In particular, the coupled integral equations for the reactant concentration and the electric potential, derived by J. L. Blue for a dilute, binary electrolyte, remain valid in the general case with modified values of certain combinations of physical constants appearing in the equations."

This article describes the development of this teleconferencing system from both technical and organisational standpoints and summarizes the studies which have been conducted on the psychological and administrative effects of using the system. It includes a short discussion on the future modes of teleconferencing. Also included is a brief description of a more recent project in which the computer is used to allow communication between students taking the same course in different cities in the province."
"This paper discusses realistic control considerations of suspension dynamics and vehicle/guideway interaction for electro-magnetically-levitated urban transit vehicles in the context of revenue applications. The emphasis is on safety, reliability and maintainability rather than performance. An example urban transit system is described and the following considerations of dynamics and control are examined: stability, magnet force requirements, magnet airgap requirements, vehicle ride, and component failures. It is shown that it is a formidable problem to ensure suspension stability under all conditions; that operation on curves is a critical magnet and control system design case; that operation of the magnets in the non-linear regime is unavoidable and that component failures will be a major problem. However, good vehicle ride is to be expected. It is concluded that magnetic lévitation suspension technology requires substantial development effort before it can be considered suitable for revenue operation."
"The application of non-linear programming techniques to optimal power system planning and operation problems has been demonstrated in the recent literature. The Fletcher-Powell technique appears to be more efficient with regard to the computer time requirement compared to the other available approaches. The technique, however, fails to provide convergence for optimization studies of large power systems. This paper presents a decomposition approach for the extension of the Fletcher-Powell technique to large power system studies. The application of the technique has been demonstrated by a sample system study. The suggested decomposition approach also requires less computer memory and time and provides a better stability of convergence than the earlier techniques."
"To maintain the integrity of communication services and to protect the associated equipment, facilities and personnel, unique engineering considerations must be given to reducing unwanted potentials which might otherwise exist on a communication line in a power station environment. These potentials could be introduced on the network from Ground Potential Rise which can be caused by power fault conditions, induction, and lightning. Consequently, the electrical protection aspect becomes accentuated where reliable service is to be provided. Good reduction of Ground Potential Rise has been achieved by use of either Neutralizing or Isolating Transformers, or a combination of both. Neutralizing Transformers are connected in series with the communication line. Any potential difference impressed on the primary of the Neutralizing Transformer will induce on the secondaries, voltages in the opposite direction, and in this way, any potential rise appearing on the communication line is prevented; whereas the Isolating Transformer is in parallel with the line and isolates Ground Potential Rise. The main disadvantages in the use of Neutralizing Transformers for electrical protection lie with cost, bulk, and core saturation; while DC continuity is not available through Isolating Transformers. The new method presented here employs a “Relay Isolating Transformer” which has the same principle of operation as the Isolating Transformer, but, in addition, provides equivalent DC continuity through a relaying arrangement. Relay Isolating Transformers will maintain undistorted communication service into power stations during power fault conditions. The economical aspects are discussed; and a comparison is made between the costs of protection using the Neutralizing Transformer vs the costs of protection using the Relay Isolating Transformer."

Optimal operation strategies developed using the minimum norm problem formulation of functional analytic optimization are given.

Computational experiments with a number of algorithms are reported for a sample system. Convergence characteristics of each algorithm are discussed."

"Nuclear-electric generating stations, predominantly the 2000 MWe Pickering station near Toronto, currently produce 5 per cent of Canada's electric energy. By the year 2000 nuclear plants will probably supply more than 40 per cent of the country's electricity. The CANDU system, featuring pressure tube reactors, heavy water moderator and natural uranium fuel, is the preferred type and will remain so for many years to come. Envisaged is the evolutionary development of the CANDU fuel cycle to embrace the use of thorium and thereby extend nuclear fuel resources by a matter of centuries. The history of the Canadian nuclear power program, its present status and future outlook are reviewed, as are the safety and environmental aspects of nuclear power."
"An equivalent to the EHV, Hydro-Quebec Network has been simulated so as to estimate the error introduced in short circuit calculations by the neglect of shunt elements: loads, shunt compensation and line charging. In order to take shunt elements into account, it is necessary to include in the short circuit study, in addition to shunt elements themselves, the initial voltage bus angles and magnitudes such as computed by a load flow study. Neglecting shunt elements in bundled conductor networks can result in large errors (up to 40%) in the computed short circuit currents. It does not seem possible to predict the direction or magnitudes of the errors a priori. A procedure is proposed to eliminate these errors."
"The SP-1, a new family of computer-controlled telephone switching systems, represents a unique technological initiative for Canada. Besides the creation of a new item of telecommunications equipment, the project marks the emergence of a powerful design force in Bell-Northern Research, and of an aggressive manufacturing organization in Northern Electric Company. The article traces the development of the main types of switching equipment which have been used in the industry, up to the present day. It then shows how evolving Canadian competence in telecommunications R&D has removed the previous reliance on design information and manufacturing knowhow from the Bell System in the U.S.A. After outlining the SP-1 project and the various machines in the family, the article goes on to discuss the philosophy applied to both software and hardware, and concludes by surveying briefly the performance of the machines in service."
"The Fast FSK is a particular kind of FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) which is useful for the transmission of digital data over an r.f. channel which is limited in both bandwidth and power. This paper describes the performance of the Fast FSK, and outlines the practical circuits which demodulate it."

"The high-Q capability of acoustic surface-wave resonators in the hundred-megahertz frequency range along with their convenience of design and fabrication make such resonators attractive components for applications in oscillators and narrowband filters. The use of a transmission line model for the periodic array forming the reflector for the surface wave, along with a perturbation simplification, gives closed-form formulas which indicate the significance of the different parameters to be specified at fabrication. Besides the reflectors and the resonators themselves, consideration is given to the electrical coupling to the surface waves by means of interdigital transducers either external to the resonator or within the standing-wave pattern inside the resonator."
"A new method is presented for the numerical computation of the Green's function associated with a linear boundary value problem. The interpretation of the Green's function as the set of probabilities of a random walk from the interior points to the boundary points allows one to extend the method to complicated domains consisting of simple overlapping sub-regions, to take into account variations in the boundaries, and to simplify calculations at boundaries like an iron-air interface. An example illustrating the strength and accuracy for calculating Green's functions is described in detail in “The numerical solution of boundary value problems over an infinite domain”, Canadian Electrical Journal, Volume 1, Number 3, pp. 18–20, July 1976."

"The most active development of commercial fuel cells was undertaken in 1967 by United Technologies for a consortium of 32 gas or mixed gas-electricity companies known as TARGET. The first phase of the TARGET program resulted in 1971 in the development of an early experimental 12.5 kW hydrocarbon-air fuel cell (Powercel PC-11). From January to December 1973, Hydro-Québec tested, under the actual operating conditions of an electrical network, six of these PC-11 power plants for a nominal output of 75 kW. The reason Hydro-Québec came to study fuel cells was to seek a more economical way of generating electricity in remote areas of the province. A description is given of the components and operation of the PC-11 fuel cell and of the installation used to conduct the tests. Practical problems encountered and some of the results obtained during the testing program are outlined. On the other hand, in 1974, United Technologies announced the beginning of another fuel cell program for Electric Utilities. The objective of this new program is to develop a 26 MW fuel cell generator for dispersed power generation. Finally, the application of fuel cell with regards to storage of electricity is briefly discussed."
"An easy method of calculating the coordinates of the centre of the circle of admittance for an induction machine is presented.

He examines alternative methods of power generation and equates this to the increased use of electrical power as a source of energy. This is exemplified by a proposal for the electrification of Canada's railways. A definition of power motive force — the motivation of a society for increased amounts of power — is proposed."

"The Canadian Society for Electrical Engineering has enjoyed a successful year. The membership of the Society has increased rapidly in that time and the development of activities across Canada has expanded quickly. A national system of student sections has been established at Canadian universities and excellent relationships have been developed with sister societies."
"The Canadian telecommunications/telephone system is internationally acknowledged as one of the finest in the world and yet Canadians take it for granted. The system has been created without government support and largely on the technological innovations that have come from Bell-Northern Research Limited, Canada's largest privately owned industrial research organization. BNR accounts each year for more than 10 percent of all the industrial research done in Canada. This technological superiority has permitted Northern Telecom to establish a secure Canadian market and to become one of the world's leading multinational telecommunications equipment manufacturers. However, problems such as higher wages and lower productivity in Canada than in competing nations; lack of a national R&D and science and technology strategy; and excessive amounts of national income consumed by governments, endanger continued growth and the future of the Canadian telecommunications systems and industry."
"A digital scheme for impedance protection of transmission lines is presented in this paper. The scheme is based on the vector representation of fundamental components of voltage and current waveforms. The 60 Hz impedance is calculated using 16 samples per cycle over a time window of one cycle. The one cycle window and high sampling rate have the advantage of less than 3/4 cycle fault detection as well as high dc and harmonic rejection. An algorithm, its implementation and real-time test-results on a laboratory model for various faults are included. Theoretical analysis is also provided to illustrate the behaviour of the digital impedance algorithm."
"The multilevel optimization techniques are used in order to determine the short range optimal scheduling of a complex hydrothermal system, in a deterministic context. In the lower level each independent sub-problem is resolved by a generalized reduced gradient method. This association (multilevel techniques and generalized reduced gradient) gives a powerful approach for large scale problems."
"Narrowband and Wideband data hybrid transmission techniques are presented and dedicated digital radio systems are reviewed. It is shown that 1.544 Mbit/s (2.023 Mbit/s) Data Above FDM Voice/Video (DAV/DAVID) is the most economical approach. Field evaluation results of: (a) 1.544 Mbit/s above 960 (and under 840) FDM channels on a Canadian National/Canadian Pacific 8 hop RCA-MM-600 6GHz microwave systems (b) 1.544 Mbit/s above 960 FDM channels on the ANIK Satellite (c) 1.544 Mbit/s above 960 FDM channels on an 8 hop TD-2 microwave system (d) 1.544 Mbit/s above 2700 FDM channels or above the combined 1200 FDM and video signals on a 102 km Philips cable system — prove the practical applications of the theories and expectations which were previously presented by the authors."
"This paper is both a review and a detailed analysis of present knowledge of the possible risks of asphyxiation and intoxication inherent in the operation of SF5 substations and maintenance of electrical switchgear. The first part of the study, the danger of asphyxiation in SF5 substations, is based on the physical properties of this gas with regard to flow and diffusion. The diffusion of SF5 into air as a function of time was calculated and the curves obtained provide a clear illustration of the tendency of this heavy gas to stagnate in low areas and the consequent risks of asphyxiation faced by personnel in such places. In a second part, the problem of the decomposition of S Fa in electrical switchgear leading to the formation of several irritant or toxic products is discussed together with the undesirable influence that certain contaminants, such as humidity, have on promoting decomposition. Several examples of the types of incident that can occur with SF6-insulated equipment are described and discussed."
"A high resolution, digitally instrumented technique for measuring the analogue properties of communication channels is described. Some test results obtained from connections on the Canadian general switched telephone network are presented to illustrate the method."

"The Power Electronics Specialists Conference, held since 1970, spans diverse electrical/ electronic disciplines and v a r i ed industrial areas to create a forum for presenting the technology of power electronics."
"The 1976 Power Electronics Specialists Conference truly exemplified the principles on which the first such conference was based, seven years ago."
"The engineering discipline of power electronics will grow only through the open exchange and critical examination of new ideas byspecialists in the field. It has been the primary goal of the Power Electronics Specialist Conference (PESC) to provide a forum for such an exchange. Over the past seven years we have seen this annual conference grow in maturity and scope. Five societies of the IEEE, representing specialists from the aerospace, commerical products and components sectors, now actively participate in the planning and co-sponsorship of PESC. Looking forward to future years, we plan to work with additional groups and societies with interests in the power electronics field."
"The circuits used in power electronics employ semiconductor switching devices that turn on and off in cyclical order. The effective circuit topology depends upon the combination of conducting and nonconducting devices at the time in question, and the switching action generates a succession of transients. \"Steady-state\" operation is construed to mean that the transients in one cycle repeat the waveforms of the previous cycle."
"A method for modelling switching-converter power stages is developed, whose starting point is the unified state-space representation of the switched networks and whose end result is either a complete state-space description or its equivalent small-signal low-frequency linear circuit model. A new canonical circuit model is proposed, whose fixed topology contains all the essential input-output and control properties of any dc-to-dc switching converter, regardless of its detailed configuration, and by which different converters can be characterized in the form of a table conveniently stored in a computer data bank to provide a useful tool for computer aided design and optimization. The new canonical circuit model predicts that, in general;switching action introduces both zeros and poles into the duty ratio to output transfer function in addition to those from the effective filter network."
"A power processing optimization methodology is established to effectively conceive a design, to meet all requirement specifications and concurrently optimize a given design quantity deemed particular desirable. Such a quantity can be the weight, efficiency, regulator response, or any other physically-realizable entity. Four design examples are given to demonstrate the methodology. The method of Lagrange multipliers is applied to three examples to acquire optimum solutions are not closed form. When closed-form solutions are not amendable in the other example, a nonlinear programming algorithm is used to conceive the optimum design numerically. Areas of future investigations are outlined to foster the power processing optimization into its ultimate maturity."
"Results of computer analysis methods are assessed in the case of a boost regulator in light and heavy condition mode. Five methods are evaluated which are based on network topology, differential equation, non-linear continuous frequency model, linearized low frequency models, and linearized discrete time model. Evaluation of criteria are: domains of application, accuracy and economics. Particular emphasis is given to a non-linear continuous time model derived from the state variable representation. Taking the average of state vector over one period leads to a large signal and small signal models with separate set of equations for buck boost regulators in heave and light conduction modes. Frequency domain transformation follows naturally involving duty ratio and input voltage. An equivalent current generator model driving the output filter is also presented."
"This paper describes a general computer model for a high power SCR that gives an accurate simulation of all important static and dynamic performance characteristics including such two-dimensional effects a spreading, gate isolation, and latch-in. Computer simulated vs. measured static characteristics of a representative device are listed for comparison. A comparison of a computer simulated vs. measured turn on transient is also included."
"State space techniques are employed to derive accurate models for buck, boost, and buck/boost converter power stages operating with and without zero-inductor-current dwell time. A generalized procedure is developed which treats the continuous-inductor-current mode without the dwell time as a special case of the discontinuous-current mode, when the dwell time vanishes. An abrupt change of system behavior including a reduction of the system order when the dwell time appears is shown both analytically experimentally."
"A steady state analysis technique is described for a naturally commutated inverter in which the output voltage is undefined during part of each operating cycle. This technique is unique in that it requires the solution of only one first order differential equation and the matching of only one end condition. The solution is valid for any load configuration provided only that its harmonic impedances are defined. This technique is more accurate than conventional harmonic analyses, which assume a defined voltage waveform, and faster and more versatile than traditional techniques which involve a complete solution of fourth order differential equations."
"The phase controlled thyristor converter supplied from a weak power system is modeled in the time domain. A state variable formulation is used for the discrete nonlinear model. Local linerization is performed about an equilibrium state to obtain a small signal steady state model for such a thyristor converter system. The stability constraints for the digital controller parameters are also obtained for a fast closed loop control. As an illustration, the small signal steady state stability analysis is shown for a six-pulse controlled thyristor dc drive having a fast control loop, weak bus, current harmonic filter, power factor correcting capacitor and transformer leakage reactance."
"Session 2 covers a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from circuit analysis methods through new circuit configurations to system applications, and also a component testing technique. In the first paper, Hayner et al. introduce a new pulse-width-modulated dc-to-dc boost converter, the Venable converter, in which current is fed continuously to the output capacitor, thereby alleviating the filtering requirements. In addition, the converter has high efficiency and transfer function properties that do not depend upon the duty ratio. Rostad et al, in the second paper,describe the application of the Venable converter to a series of satellite TWT power processors."
"A regulating DC-to-DC converter is described which utilizes a new circuit configuration to achieve several desirable features including higher efficiency, a single circuit for regulation and conversion, minimized output filter requirements and simplified control system applications. The DC operating characteristics are derived and the efficiency of the new ocnverter is shown to compare favorably with the conventional boost regulator. An AC model is derived and a comparison is made between analytical and experimental results."
"The development of a series of five TWT power processors for military and commercial communications satellites is described. Each power conditioner uses the high efficiency Venable Regulating dc-to-dc converter as a design base and together they form a series of processors capable of providing traveling-wave tube power in the range of 7 to 100 watts and at a variety of electrode voltages up to 4 kV."
"This paper describes the power supplies and control system for the LBL 20 kV, 10 A, 10 sec long-pulse neutral beam source test facility, now in operation. Such sources are used in a number of existing and planned fusion power experiments."
"A method for measurement of the instantaneous inductance L(t) of an iron core inductor is presented as function of the inductor current i, the rate of change di/dt of this current and the past history of the iron core at that moment. The inductance of a filter inductor is shown as a function of unidirectional continuous and discontinuous currents. The concept of an equivalent time invarying inductance Legu is formulated for purpose of piecewise linear time domain analysis of switching networks and a method for its calculation is indicated. The usefulness of this new tool of analysis is confirmed by agreement of calculated and experimentally obtained data."
"Preliminary observations indicate that an ultrasonic scanning technique may be useful as a quick, low cost, nondestructive method for judging the quality of circuit board materials for high voltage applications. Corona inception voltage tests were conducted on fiberglass-epoxy and fiberglass-polyimide high pressure laminates from 20° to 140° C. The same materials were scanned ultrasonically by utilizing the single transducer, through transmission technique with reflector plate, and recording variations in ultrasonic energy transmitted through the board thickness. A direct relationship was observed between ultrasonic transmission level and corona inception voltage. The ultrasonic technique was subsequently used to aid selection of high quality circuit boards for the Communications Technology Satellite."
"The advent of readily available high power static switching devices has resulted in an almost infinite number of techniques for the control, inversion, and conditioning of A C power. The six papers presented in this session represent a good cross section of the power electronic technologies utilized for the A C power conditioning in a wide range of industrial and power systems applications."
"We have developed a set of pulse width modulated inverter, 10kVA, 200V, 1200Hz (max) and have controlled induction motors, 5.5kW. This paper deals with the test results of this set and with our theoretical study of PWM inverter modulation techniques. In this paper, we also describe their operations and characteristics."
"Back-to-back connected thyristors employing ON-OFF control can be used for speed control of three-phase induction motor. Due to the nature of control the operation includes transients in all operating conditions. The basic mathematical model of the machine has been modified for different modes of operations and starting and steady-state transients has been studied on a digital computer. A good correlation has been obtained between theoretical and practical results."
"Time-optimal-response \"bang-bang\" or \"bang-hang\" technique, using four feedback control loops, synthesizes static-inverter sinusoidal output waveform by self-oscillatory but yet synchronous pulse-frequency-modulation (SPFM). A single modular power stage per phase of AC output entails the minimum of circuit complexity while providing by feedback synthesis individual phase voltage regulation, phase position control and inherent compensation simultaneously for line and load disturbances. Clipped sinewave performance is described under off-limit load or input voltage conditions. Also, approaches to high power levels, 3-phase arraying and parallel modular connection are given."
"The paper presents a direct data control method of an AC to AC thyristor converter for induction heating by a minicomputer. The details of the hardware of the interface between the converter and a minicomputer, and of the software for the following two purposes are described. (1) Programmed output power control by variations of thyristor's switching function given by the computer, and by the ON/OFF control of capacitors under instructions of the computer. (2) To use this system for the purpose of data acquisition by the computer which is necessary for designing this converter, such as the worst case turn-off time margin of the thyristor, optimal switching function pattern for power control, max. and min. output power, stability, etc."
"A new approach for applying forced commutation to a thyristor cycloconverter is presented. Using a known waveform synthesis technique, this type of cycloconverter possesses several unique characteristics. The theory of operation as related to a six-pulse, three-phase bridge configured cyclonconverter is presented. Performance of a working model is illustrated in the form of calibrated waveform oscillographs. In view of its simplicity, high efficiency and technical advantages, this type of cyclonconverter is worthy of consideration for many power frequency applications."
"Generally, static VAr generators function as variable reactances (capacitive or inductive impedances) or controllable ac current and voltage sources. This paper reviews possible methods of VAr generation and control by static thyristor circuits and describes new approaches in which power frequency changers (cycloconverters) are employed. Oscillographic recordings illustrate the operation and performance of practical systems, including a 35 MVAR arc furnace compensator."
"In aerospace and satellite application, emphasis on the design of dc-dc converters has been concentrated in the reduction of the size, weight, and cost, and in the improvement of the efficiency and reliability of the converters. This session consists of six papers of which five papers discuss various practical design aspects of the converters for achieving one or more of the above goals. One paper discusses some theoretical aspects of the converters."
"A method for the regulation of a capacitor diode voltage multiplier dc-dc converter has been developed which has only minor penalties in weight and efficiency. An auxiliary inductor is used, which only handles a fraction of the total power, to control the output voltage through a pulse width modulation method in a buck boost circuit."
"A dc-to-dc converter design based on the constant-current flux-reset principle is presented. Such converters use a mulitude of separate individual half-wave switching sections. Each section consists of a power transistor and a transformer which is reset through an external bias current source. The transformer typically contains a square-loop core without an airgap. Center tap, SCR, and bridge-type configurations are presented attendant to single-phase full-wave, and polyphase operation. Transformer-core saturation dc ratcheting and cross conduction problems, which frequently plague dc/dc converters, are eliminated. As a result, considerable differences in conduction times between power transistors can be tolerated, as well as some overlap resulting from storage and recovery lags. Typical approaches, circuit variations, and tradeoffs are being presented. Detailed schematic diagrams of actual units for aerospace applications and for industrial uses are discussed in the Appendix."
"A dc-to-dc converter circuit in the power range of 10 to 50 watts is described. While comparable to ringing choke converters or self-oscillating switching regulators in simplicity, small size, and low cost, this circuit offers many of the features usually found only in larger, more-complex driven converters."
"A description is given of the operating cycle of the resonant switching dc-to-dc power converter. A method is outlined for precise voltage regulation against line and load changes. Sufficient analysis is presented to form the basis for preliminary design to meet any set of input and output requirements. Performance features are outlined for a flight qualified, highly efficient, light weight resonant switching converter for the U. S. Navy's Navigation Technology Satellite (NTS-2)."
"State-plane analysis techniques are employed to study the voltage step-up energy-storage dc-to-dc converter. Within this framework, an example converter operating under the influence of a constant on-time and a constant frequency controller is examined. Qualitative insight gained through this approach is used to develop a conceptual free-running control law for the voltage step-up converter which can achieve steady-state operation in one on/off cycle of control. Digital computer simulation data is presented to illustrate and verify the theoretical discussions presented."
"The magnetic amplifier PWM is found here to have superior electrical, mechanical and reliability parameters when compared to its semiconductor equivalent network. The use of mag amp PWM in high frequency power conditioning is advocated. Possibilities for adding feedforward and dynamic response shaping networks are discussed. Three major magnetic PWM configurations are displayed and compared. Actual data relative to the static and dynamic behavior of a magnetically modulated switching system concludes the article."
"Discrete power semiconductors and other electrical components have demanding applications today that require new sophistication in design, characterization, and performance. Voltage and power levels, as well as switching speeds available in thyristors and transistors, make additional knowledge of dynamic characteristics essential. In this session, seven papers are presented that embody additional knowledge - two are devoted to aspects of power transistor second breakdown phenomena; one describes the design and characteristics of a field terminated diode that offers improved characteristics over an SCR; three are committed to the design of light activated thyristors and switches; and one describes nondestructive corona studies of mylar capacitors."
"The mechanism of hot spot formation in transistors is examined from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints. It is shown that after the device becomes thermally unstable the device may restabilize in a hot spot mode of operation. The IC, VCE thermal instability locus can accurately be predicted assuming the current density is uniform prior to hot spot formation. A new model is proposed which explains why the device may restabilize in a hot spot mode and why devices exhibit \"thermal hysteresis\". It is also shown using thermal mapping techniques that emitter current crowding exists in the stable hot spot mode. Finally, the experiments support the idea that second breakdown occurs when the current density within the hot spot reaches a critical value."
"This paper studies the subject of reverse bias second breakdown both experimentally and analytically. It is seen that there is excellent correlation between theory and experiment. The conclusion of this investigation is that avalanche injection is the triggering mechanism. Further, the filamentary currents that result from this can in most cases result in device failure. It is also concluded that under fixed circuit conditions, the reverse bias second breakdown potential of a transistor is completely specified by the single parameter, Vp, which is the voltage necessary for avalanche injection."
"The field terminated diode is a new, medium power (650V, 20A) switching element. In the on condition, the FTD operates as a p-i-n rectifier with a correspondingly low forward voltage drop. The device owes its uniqueness to tis buried grid structure which gives it forward blocking capability. The FTD is not a regenerative device and is not \"fired\" into the on state. This results in both higher dv/dt and di/dt ratings than a conventional thyristor."
"A new structure for a light sensitive area is investigated which should be used for direct light activation of high power thyristors. This structure enables thyristors to be constructed which require only moderate light intensity for triggering while still exhibiting a high dv/dt capability. Test samples were produced showing a forward blocking voltage of 4.5 kV. They can withstand a rate of voltage rise of more than 3000 V/μs even at a temperature of 125°C. Using a GaAs-LED they can be triggered with an incident radiant power of about 15 mW."
"A new type of light activated bi-directional thyristor device, which is well suited for control of full wave ac power, is presented. This device consists of two thyristors connected in inverse parallel and one or two light emitting diodes provided between the thyristors, which are optically coupled so that either thyristor can be triggered by the light signal from the LED. It has an improved commutating dv/dt characteristic of 100 ν/μs and has ratings of 1,000 V for blocking voltage and 100 A for current carrying capability."
"Laser fired semiconductor switches have been operated reliably at multi-megawatt power levels with nanosecond rise-times. Pulse currents up to 10,000 amperes and durations from 50 nanoseconds to 40 microseconds were obtained from storage lines charged as high as 1300 volts. In this paper data obtained from several experiments are compared to calculated results from a theoretical computer model. The analysis, reported previously (1), has been extended to include the effects of the initial carrier dynamics during turn-on."
"Metallized Mylar high voltage capacitors made in ratings up to 20 kV with special metallization patterns allow a single winding with two terminations and several series sections. These capacitors can be operated at stresses of about 2500 volts/mil, and energy densities up to 1. 24 j/cu.in. -- a 75% improvement over new resin-impregnated mica paper capacitors and 400% over conventional paper units. They are self-healing against a limited number of breakdowns. A weakness of this construction is it may result in low level dc corona below the dc rating and relatively low corona inception voltage on ac. This paper is concerned with quantitative measurements of corona on dc and ac, and an evaluation of corona's voltage dependence to establish safe levels of operating stress."
"The final session of the 1976 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference included four papers on various techniques for current limiting or surge voltage reduction in power processing circuits. One paper dealt with the problems of EMI and another discussed power factor and filtering problems The first paper by Wadlington described a current-limiting circuit in a dc to dc converter. Current sensing was provided on the primary side of the transformer. This approach provides protection for the switching transistors from both overload and transient overcurrent conditions and also prevents saturation of the transformer. The circuit was designed to have slow dynamic response near the threshold of current limiting and fast dynamic response for large overload currents."
"A current-limiting circuit for use in pulse width controlled dc-to-dc converters is described. This circuit ensures reliable converter operation by providing device protection against various transient overcurrent stresses as well as against output overload conditions."
"A novel saturated time-delay transformer is connected in series with the dc load. The transformer detects and limits overcurrent until the fault has been corrected or the power source removed. This transformer design can be used at any voltage level however, the paper describes it in conjunction with high voltage (HV) circuits. Some design details for such a transformer are given."
"When the switching regulator is used for the supply of the color T.V. receiver, the following two conditions are desired to be satisfied. (1) The switching operations should be completed within the retrace interval of horizontal scanning. (2) The output voltage is close to the input voltage value. To realize a regulator satisfying both of these two conditions, a reactor with two windings should be used. In this case, turn ration of windings differs far from unity. Hence a surge voltage due to leakage inductance appears across the transistor. The amount of the surge may be great enough to cause a break down in the transistor. We propose in this paper a method of cascade connection to give a solution to the problem of switching surge. The key point of the surge reduction is to make use of a cascade connection of the switching regulator with reactors of single winding. The efficiency, the voltage rating of the transistor and the regulation range are discussed on typical three kinds of circuit."
"Radiated and conducted emission standards are derived for each converter in a multiple DC-DC converter system, allocated as a function of power rating. Analytical methods of predicting the emission and design techniques for achieving the standards are described. Recommended procedures and test equipment used to determine the actual emission level of each converter are also described."
"Solid state power conditioners have historically presented poor power factors to single phase supplies. An analysis technique is presented, while several typical input currents are discussed and waveform bounds presented which allow high (0.9) power factors."
"In a mercury bombardment ion engine, the discharge supply is a high current, low voltage supply that maintains an arc or discharge inside the engine. The output of the power supply is commandable and the response to this command is current, Ina 30 cm ion engine the supply provides up to 45 volts at ~13 amperes and is referenced at ~1100 volts above ground. Due to the engine discharge characteristics, a very slow feedback control loop is required. A high speed current limit must therefore be used to protect the components in the power conditioner, in this case a pulse width modulated bridge inverter. A high speed cycle-bycycle current limit circuit which allows the inverter to continue running in an overcurrent condition is used to protect the inverter. The high speed current sensing allows the inverter to be turned off each half cycle before the current in the primary of the inverter exceeds a safe level. This permits the inverter to continue to provide current into a discharge or a fault condition, until the feedback control system can actively control the current."
"The purpose of this guide is: 1) To review grounding practices with especial reference to safety. 2) To establish, as a basis for design, the safe limits for potential differences which can exist in a station, under fault conditions, between points which can be contacted by the human body. 3) To provide a step by step guide for the design of practical grounding systems based on these limits. 4) To recommend test methods for obtaining data for the design of ground systems, and for verifying the adequacy of ground systems as constructed. 5) To develop mathematical methods as an aid in the understanding and solution of typical ground gradient problems. 6) To make available in English translation, some of the more pertinent and valuable foreign language articles. 7) To provide a comprehensive bibliography, with abstracts, of existing literature related to the subject, for the benefit of those seeking additional information not included herein."
    "The Awards Presentation, a ceremony observed annually at the Society's Conferences, took place Monday, 18 October. The awards were presented following the Get Together Luncheon, according to a long-standing tradition of the Society. President Kenneth M. Mason presented the awards listed below to the recipients or their representatives. The work of James Wong Howe, a distinguished cameraman, was recognized posthumously by a Special Commendation Award accepted by Peter Keene. — Fifteen newly elected Fellows of the Society received certificates from President Mason at the Fellows Luncheon held at the Engineers Club on Tuesday, 19 October. The Award citations and brief biographies of the recipients appear below."
"The brief reports published here are intended to reflect the large volume of work being carried on through the SMPTE Engineering Dept. and its committees. For more detailed information on the activities or the individual projects, one should contact Alex E. Alden, Manager of Engineering Services of the SMPTE, at headquarters. The Society welcomes participation by specialists from industry in the work of its Engineering Committees and all those who may be interested in exploring the possibility of active membership on any of the committees should contact A. E. Alden or Roland J. Zavada, Engineering Vice-President of the Society. While the Society is in a position to provide the mechanics for the development of National Standards, it relies heavily on the input made available from industry through its engineering committee members."
                 "To control the discharge of water-contaminating substances, photoprocessing labs must first determine the nature of the contaminant and the extent of the discharge. This involves the taking of proper samples. Faulty sampling procedures result in unreliable analysis and erroneous conclusions which can not only be costly but also result in the plant's being denied access to the municipal sewer system. The sampling techniques and the means of flow measurement currently available to the photoprocessor are described, and the importance of effluent monitoring in establishing the effectiveness of recovery and reuse practices is emphasized. A basic approach to initiating an effective sampling program is presented. Tests for metals, acidity, chemical oxygen demand, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon (expected to be widely used in the future) and many other factors are described. The use of sampling and flow measurement to improve the monitoring of silver levels and the effectiveness of silver recovery is discussed to illustrate the benefits and problems encountered with in-house effluent analysis. The paper features extensive references, bibliography, and tabulated information. Among the many items covered here are: manufacturers (scores of them, producing a great variety of equipment), principle of operation, cost, reliability, parameter measured, range of measurement, and ease of installation."
"The two most commonly used methods for silver removal — metallic replacement and electrolytic plating — can remove better than 95% of the silver but are not effective in removing any other metals which may be present in photographic effluents. The method of chemical precipitation with sodium sulfide can remove virtually 100% of the silver and most other metals from dilute or concentrated photographic effluents using one-step treatment. A sulfide precipitation process has been developed using automatic pH control, automatic detection of the precipitation endpoint, and two-stage filtration which is capable of safely and efficiently treating photographic effluents of varying pH and metals concentration."
"The role of the industrial engineer in the construction of facilities such as Technicolor's large new film-processing plant is examined. (With a processing capacity of 15 million feet or 4.6 million meters of film per week, this is certainly one of the largest such plants in the world.) People in the areas of plant and operations management are generally “too close” to the problem to be effective designers of such a facility, although their input into the study is a requirement. They may be able to define productivity, but they do not always know how to get it. The industrial engineer is the link between the operational people and the design engineer. Using flow charts, plastic grids and templates, job descriptions and other data, including his personal knowledge of plant operations and procedures, the industrial engineer develops the optimum layout."
"Two key objectives must be kept in mind when a major relocation of a plant is undertaken: to make the move most economically and to ensure the least disturbance to production. The relocation of the Technicolor Motion Picture Division laboratory and executive offices from Hollywood to Universal City involved six phases: logistics, scheduling, preparation, execution, follow-up, and evacuation. Tasks to be managed under these headings are examined in detail. Through cooperation and attention to these six phases and using in-house labor to move everything except two computers and some heavy machine shop equipment, the move was carried off with virtually no disruption of production and this was done at a lower cost than was budgeted."
              "The problems of synchronizing the increasing number and variety of broadcast television sources to a local station reference are examined, and the conventional analog methods employed to obtain synchronization are noted. The digital framestore synchronizer provides the general solution today, although since their introduction in 1974, such synchronizers have not been readily accepted in the industry because of the cost, size, weight, and power consumption of the first production units. A synchronizer is described which can store a complete video frame and yet occupies only 8.75 in (22.2 cm) of panel height on a standard 19-in (48.5-cm) rack. The power consumption is less than 250 VA, and the weight is less than 60 lb (27.3 kg). The video input circuitry is designed to provide time-base correction of any helical-scan videotape recorder television signals and of most quadruplex VTR signals. The advantages of the framestore technique over field-store are discussed, and some applications for the synchronizer are considered."
"The following three papers deal with the subject of using a graticule or overlay on an oscilloscope to help determine whether or not a television waveform will produce a subjectively acceptable picture. Aspects of this subject have been discussed as far back as 1947–1948. The concept of echo weighting and several data involved in the concept were described in a Journal paper of May 1953 (Influence of Television Transmission Echoes). — It is interesting to see how the concept has become more definite and formalized and how the requirements have become somewhat less severe. In the early days, the communications people were scared of picture deterioration and afraid of the consequences of possible miscalulation. Present-day engineers are more firmly certain, because of the widespread experience, of their tolerances. For a long time, because of the limited precision and stability of cathode-ray oscilloscopes, it was deemed impractical to use graticules as indicators, but engineers can now predict with some confidence the result of a particular waveform adjustment. It is now reasonable to assert that the industry should settle on a standard graticule for evaluating television transmission in North America."
"A Short-Time Waveform Distortion (SD) graticule was proposed by this author in September 1971. In December 1972, A. M. Lessman published echo-time weighting data that can be used as the basis for designing an oscilloscope graticule. Echo-time weighting as such is of little practical usefulness and must be converted into amplitude-time weighting to become the basis for an operational graticule. It is shown that in certain parts there is remarkably good agreement between the proposed SD graticule and the amplitude-time weighting derived from Lessman's echo-time weighting data, while other parts of the derived amplitude-time weighting are either inapplicable or of negligible significance."
"Gain and phase deviations in the transmission path of a television signal above 300 kHz affect the smallest picture elements of the signal and may cause undesirable echoes and loss of resolution in the picture. This type of “short-time” distortion may be evaluated by waveform measurements using a test signal and an oscilloscope graticule. The test signal selected is the standard “sine-squared” step. The graticule design assumes transmission impairment to be subjectively equivalent to that of a single well-displaced echo of appropriate magnitude. Thus, the envelope of the sum of the test signal and its delayed echo define the graticule contours. The relative amplitude of the delayed echo is determined from the results of subjective single-echo time-weighting tests. The derivation of this envelope, while approximate, takes into account the rise time of the test signal and the normalization process that enters into adjusting the oscilloscope. The graticule as it is used applies directly to transmission impairments that give rise to single-echo distortion. Experience in using similarly derived graticules for visual-telephone testing indicates the method to be useful for multiple and smeared echo distortions."
"Because international standards for video test signals and test methods for long-distance television circuits have recently been agreed upon by CCIR and CMTT committees, it is now important to resolve a long-standing discussion in North America on the dimensions of a time-weighted graticule for the 2T sin2 pulse. In the past in North America, either no graticule has been used to determine the subjective impact of a signal distortion or else a scaled version of a graticule designed for British 405-line monochrome television (shown recently not to conform to North American standards) was used. The various factors which must be considered in the formulation of a time-weighted graticule for the 2T sin2 pulse are examined, including the graticule truncation close to the impulse to prevent unwanted color distortions, the truncation at the extremities to meet the constraints posed by typical test signal formats, and the approximations involved in the derivation of a practical graticule with simply defined dimensions. Recent data by Lessman on echo time weighting are used to define a suitable graticule. The proposal involves straight-line approximation of the echo-weighting factors and considers the effect of the measurement errors resulting from the shape of typical distortions relative to the graticule outlines, in a time interval where, for economic reasons, the total available weighting should be obtainable. The proposed graticule is compared with the old scaled graticule, and the dimensions of a direct transformation of the echo-weighting factors are given to show the extent of the approximations used. There is sufficient difference between the scaled graticule and the one proposed to consider the new graticule as a North American standard."
"The Joint Committee on Intersociety Coordination represents the EIA, IEEE, NAB, NCTA, and SMPTE. The JCIC meets upon call from any of the member organizations to discuss specific subjects which may involve the other members and may warrant joint action, either by a statement of policy or initiation of an appropriate committee activity. Since 1968 three Ad Hoc Committees have been set up; these are study committees for Color Television, Television Broadcast Ancillary Signals, and Television Sound."
"A study was made of the use of photoinstrumentation as an aid in determining the proportion of soybean seed loss attributable to stem cutting, with a view toward improving the process for more efficient crop recovery. Soybean seed loss during harvesting may exceed 10% of the crop, mostly due to losses encountered at the combine cutterbar. Laboratory cutting analyzers were built that enabled cutting to be studied under controlled conditions of speed and blade-stem interaction. Both repetitive-flash (stroboscoplc) still photography and Hycam motion-picture analyses were made of the cutting and pod-shattering process. Finite differencing and the Taylor's series expansion were used in the development of a computer program for the reduction of displacement vs elapsed time (or frame number) data from motion-picture records to provide velocity and acceleration graphical printouts. Shatter loss with single-impact cutting was found to be severe but declined gradually with increasing speed of knife up to 12,000 ft/min (3,659 m/min). At high blade speeds, stems were often subject to multiple cuts before severance. Seed loss was substantially lower for the multiple-cut stems where there was less transfer of energy along the stem. The lateral vibration of the stem was measurable on film and provided quantitative information on energy transfer into the stem."
              "Motion-picture laboratories contend with several sources of variability in producing consistent, high-quality prints, especially in the case of color reversal intermediate (CRI) and interpositive-duplicate negative duplicating systems. What has been lacking is a simple, inexpensive, easily implemented, and universally adopted control method for the production of interpositives and duplicate negatives from negative originals. We propose a control method based upon the concept of LAD — Laboratory Aim Density. A standard film patch is specified at densities midway between the minimum and maximum typically obtained for normal camera exposure. All other material in a production (regardless of film type or origin) is timed with respect to this standard patch. Laboratory Aim Densities are specified, and tolerances are suggested, for the print-through of the standard patch for each film type onto which the original or intermediates may be printed. These Laboratory Aim Densities are chosen to be at the center of the usable straight-line portions of the duplicating film's characteristic curves. Within the tolerances of normal film, printer, and process variability, consistent duplicates having good tone and color reproduction characteristics will be obtained from the original. This method may be adapted also for obtaining color internegatives from reversal camera film originals."
"The advent of high-performance electromechanical servo systems and of an electronically variable delay-line (EVDL)-type time-base corrector for videotape recorders (VTRs) made recovery of a properly phased color video possible in the early 1960s. The development of the video digitization and memory technique in the late 1960s produced a digital time-base corrector (DTBC) of expanded capture range at a commercially acceptable cost. Use of VTR systems with the color-under technique, with its acceptable color video performance, operational economy and simplicity, has become widespread in many non-broadcast fields as well as in the electronic newsgathering field. An important application of DTBC is for color-under VTRs, and many variations of DTBCs are being developed to further improve the performance when used with VTRs. A DTBC is also a useful ancillary element of high-performance VTRs, including quadruplex types."
"The following paper is the first of nine to be published in this and the next issue of the Journal, covering all aspects of NBC's Television Central System. With the engineering expertise and experience gained over four decades in the television field, and with significant software contributions from the RCA laboratories, the program leading to automation and computer control of the entire NBC Television Network was begun in 1969 and completed in 1974."
"Large television centers are becoming more common throughout the world. While the design of individual studios and associated control rooms within such centers can be dealt with based on past experience, the routing and ultimate release-to-air of numerous individual signal sources within the center take on a special dimension when the system is very large. Rebuilding around an ongoing operation within an existing structure strongly influences the final design. A review of existing operating practices suggests many possibilities for improvement from a human-factors viewpoint. The final scheme includes the use of a large audio-video routing apparatus, a multichannel computer-controlled release studio, and numerous remote-control subsystems. Automated program schedule preparation and flexible voice communications play important roles in the completed system."
"Switching Central is a multichannel computer-controlled facility which provides monitoring, switching, and control of all Network and local television programming originating in NBC New York. The system is designed to support ten simultaneous channels and is presently equipped for six. All channels are identical and designed to be free-standing and functionally independent of one another."
"The function of the NBC computer control system for television switching is to provide the overall execution and control necessary to support the production of several independent streams of program material. This function includes all program switching along with control of all video and audio sources in the NBC plant. The primary input to the control system is a magnetic tape prepared by NBC Management Information Systems which contains a daily routine describing the program material for the day — including channel (Local NBC, Network, Regional Networks), time of action, length of material, text describing the material, and the associated video and audio sources of the material. The requirement of continuous operation and system reliability dictated a multi-computer configuration to support the required central function. The configuration chosen consists of two different types of computer systems, called channel processors and keyboard processors. Channel systems carry out the switching of program material and facilities control for a single operator-specified channel; keyboard systems provide all command and bookkeeping functions. The discussion is complete to the level of individual tally lights."
"The operation of a television network requires the efficient and reliable processing of a great number of video signals not only from in-plant studios but also from diverse external sources via satellites, network land lines, and microwave systems. The new NBC Transmission Center provides direct monitoring access to 120 video inputs and 6 independent output channels (expandable to 10). It provides 26 video processing amplifiers and includes 30 source selectors for any of 100 inputs to 30 user entities; there is also a character generator “menu” display for supplying updated information on resource reassignment and emergency change. The use of patch cords has been greatly reduced compared to past practice."
"Television audio must accompany the picture in television broadcasting—a fact sometimes overlooked. High-quality sound is essential to network broadcasting. Thus, the new NBC transmission facility was designed and built to process, distribute, monitor, mix, and control hundreds of high-quality audio signals, incoming and outgoing to the network plant."
             "A new self-contained camera control unit (CCU) for the TKP-45 portable color television camera head has been designed. It can be readily carried into the field for portable production applications or for electronic newsgathering. It can operate either from a 36-V battery or from ac. With the new CCU, the TKP-45 retains essentially all of the operational features of the TK-45 Studio/Field camera, and a precision, genlockable, internal sync generator has been added. The many functions that are provided make this a top quality portable production camera."
"When geosynchronous satellites were first placed in orbit, it was thought that there was little about the space environment which could cause sudden failure of the satellites other than the direct impact of a meteorite. Since 1972, there has been a growing awareness that the environment is not as benign as was first thought and that communications satellites now commonly used for international and domestic relay of telephony and television can suffer some unexpected interruptions in service. This paper describes the nature of this new problem and the way in which it can affect spacecraft. It also describes some of the earlier problems which have complicated the operation of spin-stabilized satellites."
"Present-day automation systems frequently use a minicomputer in an on-line mode as the primary controller. The computer system consists of three major parts: the actual computer, the software instructing it how to perform its tasks, and the peripherals that connect it to the “outside world.” The reliability of each part in a computer-controlled television switching system and the options available to assure acceptable performance under various conditions of failure are discussed."
"The peculiar nature of the standard test signal currently used in analog television system evaluation treats a digitized video signal in such a way that the true performance of the system under test (VTRs in particular) is not revealed. The common test signal for measuring DP and DG in a VTR is a 20-IRE-unit subcarrier superimposed either on a 100-IRE-unit ramp signal or on a stair-step signal. Experience has shown that even though the VTR circuits are only fractionally loaded, the results of DP and DG measurements may be easily interpreted for fully loaded (saturated color) operation. This is not true for combined analog and digital systems because quantizing errors, once introduced, have a fixed peak value so that they actually represent a smaller and smaller proportion of the signal as the signal is made greater. Standard measurements of DP and DG in high-quality digital systems can be so misleading as to show errors of more than 8% DG and 5° DP. Two improvements in measuring techniques are proposed: first, the subcarrier amplitude of the test signal should be doubled to 40 IRE units peak-to-peak, and second, the subcarrier phase should be made random during the ramp or stair-step. These changes will not eliminate the problem but will make meaningful measurements easier to obtain."
"Three-color meters are used to measure the color quality (color temperature) of light sources, and to select the appropriate filter for balancing color films designed for one type of illuminant to light sources of a different color quality. This paper describes a direct-reading three-color meter which automatically computes and instantaneously displays both blue/red and green/red color ratio readings, independent of the absolute light level and without a need for operator adjustments. A filter computer, used to calculate color correction filters to be placed over the camera lens, is also described."
"It has been demonstrated that holography holds a great potential in art conservation and preservation and also as a technique for recording images of works of art. Its use in revealing damaged and deteriorating areas of both statuary and paintings has been proven elsewhere and new possibilities are being discovered regularly. It is now possible to envision the use of holography in many unique applications such as in museums of three-dimensional images or even the simultaneous visual comparison of volumetric similarities between statuary being exhibited continents apart. Studies of works of Pisano, Donatello, and others are described and illustrated, and the special problems of preserving art in the environment of Venice are noted."
               "Because the subject of dirt in motion picture production is of international scope, a detailed study was made of the many factors affecting the final screen quality of a print regarding freedom from the effects of dirt in the numerous stages of production or post production. The basic elements of air, processing solutions, clothing, excessive traffic in critical areas, equipment, film handling, static electricity, building construction and maintenance, janitorial service, and film cleaning are discussed. Methods of tracing and analyzing dirt sources are outlined and recommendations are made for ideal conditions to minimize or eliminate dirt in each area."
"The author, a longstanding member of the Australian film industry, reports from his notes (made during two trips) on the motion-picture industry in the People's Republic of China. A fairly complete status report on the industry is presented. Production methods, the influence of the cultural revolution on film production, and general studio organization are described in the first part of the paper. The second part discusses some technological aspects of China's film industry. Interestingly, color rawstock — negative, print film, color reversal intermediate — is now manufactured in the country. An infrared screen technique is used to obtain traveling mattes, and process photography is carried out using the “Crystal Ball” front-projection process (which employs a beaded screen). A non-Western standard for 8.75mm film is described. The manufacture of studio equipment in China is mentioned. Printing and processing methods and release-print inspection are also described."
"The following four papers complete the detailed treatment of NBC's Television Central System that was begun last month. For an overview of the NBC system plus accounts of the switching system in practice, computer control of switching, and audio and video transmission, the reader is referred to the October Journal and specifically to the first five papers in this series: “NBC Television Central—An Overview” by F. L. Flemming; “NBC Switching Central” by R. Edmondson and R. Post; “Functional Capabilities of a Computer Control System for Television Switching” by R. H. Roth, A. Kaiman, B. H. Sams, and A. H. Simon; “Versatile Transmission Video Facilities at NBC New York” by R. Mausler; and “Television Transmission Audio Facilities at NBC New York” by H. Krochmal and R. Mausler."
"Improved communications for NBC's entire New York plant was a major goal of the recent NBC Television Central project. Throughout the planning, design, and installation phases, the operating modes of the existing communications subsystems provided a baseline for technical and operational improvements. Among subsystems discussed in this paper are production interphone, interrupted-return-feed, engineering interphone, and intercom. Also discussed are specific problems of telephone interfacing, telecine and videotape machine communications, and communication with remote areas."
"The newly automated Television Central facility at NBC's Radio City plant in New York controls ten simultaneous audio/video channels. These computer-controlled channels are independent, in that each has its own audio and video switching system as well as control of rolling devices, display systems, and manual overrides. Selection and installation of the General Automation SPC-16/45 computer and peripheral equipment permitted this high level of switching control. The computer architecture and input/output options as well as the needs of the NBC Production and Engineering staffs were important considerations."
"A large remote-control system, interfacing 24 studios to 60 machines (videotape and film), was recently installed at the NBC New York Studios as part of the Television Central Project. A time-sharing scheme was selected to avoid the high cost and complexity of a hard-wired approach. Individual buses for each studio eliminate common-mode failures. Any machine can be assigned to any studio without conflict, and machine status can be monitored continuously."
"Broadcast quality audio signals are now supplied to the NBC Television Network after pulse-code-modulation (PCM) processing. The 12-bit PCM system and the biphase modulation techniques described in this paper allow six multiplexed signals (video, four audio, and data) to use a common crosspoint while maintaining exceptional isolation among all signals. The heart of the system is a 32-thousand crosspoint (100 × 320) routing switcher which supplies the audio and video signals required for network services and supports all in-house production and recording needs for the NBC New York plant."
"At its 26th meeting, on 10 September 1974, the Satellite Technical and Operational Committee—Television (STOC—TV), having discussed the need for standardized operational graticules for oscilloscopes used to check the technical quality of long-distance connections containing links by satellite, decided to form, an ad hoc subcommittee for such graticules. STOC—TV was established in North America in 1967 in recognition of the need to develop unified operating practices, technical quality criteria, and standards for international television connections using communications satellites. Its membership comprises companies operating intercontinental satellite links and domestic satellite systems and, also, major terrestrial common carriers and broadcasting networks in the US. and Canada."
"To Promote Standardized Methods of measurement and compatibility of results when waveform monitors are used at International Television Centers and other points along an International Television Connection, the Satellite Technical and Operational Committee—Television (STOC-TV) recommends that graticules for waveform measurements be in accordance with the guidelines contained in the present document."
"The commercial motivation for storage of 30 minutes of high-quality video on 30-cm-diameter discs has pressed the technology of surface scanning beyond the practical limits of stylus use. Replacement of the stylus by a focused spot of light gives increased resolution, freedom from wear, and the possibility of excellent protection against handling and environmental effects. It also requires the use of servomechanisms to register the light spot with the track both transversely (radial tracking) and longitudinally (focusing), and these in turn require optical error detectors."
                                     "Passage of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 marked the latest of the United States' efforts to replace our customary system of measurement with a metric system, in this case the International System of Units (SI). It is almost certain that the change will take place, since it is supported by a significant number of government agencies, of industries and their trade associations, and of scientific and engineering societies. The effect of conversion on the units of measurement used by the SMPTE in its future publications and standards is discussed, and present practices are touched upon."
"Previous papers have described the control of single output television switchers, commonly used for transmitter booth operation, by means of a computer. Recent designs have included numerous systems, both radio and television, in which a number of busses are controlled by one computer. The increased data load, the sharing of switcher input equipment such as tape and film machines, and the requirements for emergency manual control all affect the system design. A standard software package has been adopted for both radio and television service, and the hardware is based on a modular approach permitting easy alteration to suit the requirements of individual stations."
"Efforts to reduce the size and weight of portable color television cameras have recently culminated in the introduction of the Microcam I. The Microcam allows operation for well over an hour with a system (lens, camera, Viewfinder, power supply) weighing less than 13 Ib (5.9 kg). It utilizes three ⅔–in Plumbicons and very sophisticated electronics to minimize power consumption, which of course reduces the required weight of batteries. (The Microcam II, to be introduced in several more years, will use the same electronics but charge-coupled sensors instead of Plumbicons to achieve even greater weight savings.) The complete video processing system consists of four circuit boards that bear respectively three processing amplifiers, an NTSC sync generator with optional genlocking capability, a two-line image enhancer, and an NTSC encoder. The electronics pack, designed using aerospace principles, may be carried with a shoulder strap or worn on a belt. In its first field use, the new portable color television camera was very well received."
"WAGA-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, has now more than a year's experience with electronic newsgathering and employs two ENG mobile units and seven mobile film crews. The heart of the ENG system is the Nurad quadrupole antenna located at the 950-ft (290-m) level of the WAGA-TV combined studio transmitter plant, 5.5 mi (8.9 km) from the downtown “canyon” area. This news-intensive, downtown area includes the major portion of the business and retail district, the State Capitol and offices, City Hall and County offices, and the municipal, state and federal courts. WAGA's ENG system has proven 100% effective within the downtown area, and is estimated to be 95% effective overall out to 28 mi (45 km) which is as far away as we have attempted to use the system. Factors that influenced the design of the ENG mobile van and the ENG control area are discussed, and efforts to take advantage of the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the various component units are described. The fact that an ENG crew is about twice as productive as a corresponding film crew is offset somewhat by the fact that ENG crews are best sent on assignments where timeliness is crucial, because videocameras, batteries, umbilicals and VTRs collectively are still much heavier and more unwieldy than film camera systems."
"Using a Digital Equipment Corp. PDP-11/40 minicomputer with peripheral equipment along with a Teletype terminal, Technicolor, Inc., in North Hollywood has assembled a system for the automated generation of paper printer-light tapes. The system handles two separate but related problems: it converts large quantities of past light-tape data into the format required by the present equipment, and it provides for the storage and updating of light-tape data being created for new negatives as they enter the plant. The first phase of this process computer implementation, the equipment involved, and the capabilities of the programmed computer are discussed."
"Very little has been published during the past fifteen years on the subject of cleaning solvents and it is the object of this survey to provide users with sufficient information to select the correct solvent for their particular application."
             "A tutorial review of the pulse-code-modulated (PCM) NTSC signal characteristics is given including: (1) basic data rate of television images; (2) the color encoder-decoder or codec; (3) PCM encoding rates and phase relative to the color subcarrier; (4) quantizing errors; and (5) the bit rates for practical television systems. These matters are presently being considered by various committees who will promulgate digital standards for the television industry."
"Recent advances in digital television are exemplified in the techniques now available for processing and correcting the errors that arise when videotape is played back with a VTR. Such techniques use time-base correctors (TBCs) in systems for eliminating VTR distortions. A short history of time-base correction is given, from the delay-line units used 20 years ago with quadruplex VTRs to the latest digital TBCs that can reduce large time-base errors of helical-scan VTRs virtually to invisibility. Principles and details of the Microtime 640 Digital TBC are discussed. Briefly, it operates in either the V/H-lock or no-lock mode. Either direct or heterodyne color recovery can be selected. The input signal is sampled at three times the color subcarrier frequency, and 8-bit PCM encoding is used. For speed and simplicity of control, the Model 640 employs a bipolar random-access memory (RAM) of about 24-kbit capacity. Such TBCs can now interface with virtually any VTR, and their use is expected to grow steadily."
"The formation of the SMPTE Study Group on Digital Television (SG-DTV) began in August 1974, with the appointment of C. P. Ginsburg to chair the group. Initial responsibilities for the Chairman included: (1) collaboration with W. T. Wintringham, Engineering Vice-President of SMPTE, and J. A. Flaherty, Chairman of the Television Technology Committee, to whom the Chairman of the Study Group was eventually to report, for the purpose of drawing together a Charter which would properly describe the functions which the Study Group was to perform; (2) selection for participation in the Study Group of a nucleus of technical people who were active and expert in the field of digital television; and (3) establishment with the European Broadcasting Union Working Party C, which has been involved in studies of the digital television field for some time, of a basis for future collaboration with the SG-DTV. The Charter evolved to the following form in November 1974, and it has not yet been found necessary to modify it."
"Algae, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and rotifers are microorganisms that occur in motion-picture processing operations. The type of organism found is dependent on the chemical composition, temperature, pH, and water content of the processing solution. Wash waters are especially susceptible to microbial contamination because of chemical carry-over, gel fragments, and dirt from the air, which serve as nutrients. The ways of preventing such growth include insuring the proper physical layout of the laboratory, using filters, housecleaning regularly, and (in some cases) using a microbicide."
"Large-screen cinemas are defined as those in which the screen appears large to the audience. This condition is approached when the screen occupies 60° of the viewer's field of vision horizontally and 30° vertically. Sightlines in large-screen cinemas should be calculated, based on an eye-level-to-top-of-head parameter of 10 to 11 in (25.4 to 27.9 cm). Oblique viewing angles should not exceed 45° to the significant action area of the screen. Projection angles and their limits, comfort, screen brightness for large screens, and basic acoustic requirements are commented on. Formulas for single-row sight line determination are included."
"A proposal of the Nordisk Film/TV Union (NFTU), document 1069–1969, is discussed in great detail. This document refers to the measurement of acoustic response in cinema theaters for optical 35-mm soundtracks. The instructions, procedures and equipment this proposal offers for consideration are described at length, for the benefit of the service engineer for whom this type of measurement may constitute a new field of activity. Also, the work carried out simultaneously in other countries and by ISO is described. Reference is made to test films and further developments of instrumentation in the recent past. Mention is made of the new possibilities opened up by an ISO Draft Proposal, calling for an “Y”-curve to cover films currently in production or exploitation, and for a “X”-curve for such new systems as the Dolby SVA and the Hue-Modulated Photographic Color Soundtrack. A hope for further research regarding roll-off or no roll-off is also expressed."
          "The preparation, storage, retrieval, and broadcasting of stills (slides and graphics) add up to a significant cost element that must be controlled in the operation of a typical television facility. The physical handling in using stills can damage the materials and result in human error. Furthermore, reserving a studio camera and/or a telecine chain to show stills is inefficient and not cost-effective. A new system to overcome these problems, the Electronic Still Store (ESS), has now been demonstrated by CBS and Ampex. The ESS can randomly search an electronic library of still pictures from a number of locations, arrange the stills in the order for playing, play them as fast as 1 still/s, and do these things without physically touching the media. The system makes available a current stock of about 1500 stills (those expected to be needed within the next 100 days) and a long-term stock of about 5000 stills. System control tasks are handled by an LSI-11 microcomputer which emulates the larger PDP-11/40. The core element of the ESS is a very reliable computer disc drive. The adaptation of the disc drive for storing PCM video requires only that the dissimilar standards of digitally encoded video and the computer peripheral be reconciled."
"The SMPTE Winter Television Conference in Detroit on 23–24 January yielded 15 excellent topical papers on television newsgathering and 14 on digital television. Several of the digital television papers have already appeared in the Journal, and all of the newsgathering papers have been published in unedited form in a softcover book, Television Newsgathering, available from Society Headquarters at $1 2.50 per Copy."
"From the perspective of a technical operations director whose television station has more than a year's experience in the gathering of television news on videotape, the author examines the question, “How well does the electronic journalism (EJ) system fulfill the goal for which it was designed and assembled?” To achieve a coherent and functional system, the designers must bring together diverse experience involving microwave transmission, backpack cameras, portable VTRs, VTR editing and playback systems, vehicle construction and modification, and on-air news operations. Probably, few people have expertise in all six areas, so each of these subjects is discussed in turn. A framework — actually used — for assembling an EJ system from these elements is described. Strong points and weak points of the EJ system are examined, and reasons for the shortcomings and possible solutions for them are considered. It is hoped that the experience of WKYC-TV will benefit those who are now wrestling with the problems of installing a new EJ system."
"At the heart of electronic journalism (EJ) at NBC is a small, battery-powered, portable VTR — the Sony U-Matic® VO-3800, which uses 20-min 3/4-in cassettes. Whether the stories on these cassettes are beamed to the studio by microwave or carried there by courier or by the News team, they are soon ready for editing on Sony VO-2850 VTRs prior to airing. The EJ edit rooms at NBC's Radio City studios are described in detail and a number of useful modifications of standard equipment are discussed. Such modifications have made a time-code reader more versatile, provided a new edit-preview capability, allowed the VTRs to be used in a fast-search “Videola” mode, and — by using the video signal for control purposes — permitted camera-trigger operation of the portable VTR and (optionally) a time-code generator. Block diagrams of the audio, video, and monitoring systems are discussed. Finally, a new tri-color VTR system is revealed for obtaining full-fidelity NTSC color signals with low-cost helical-scan VTRs. The system records white, red, and blue signals with separate portable VTRs; a time code on a soundtrack and three separate time-base correctors are used to assure proper registration. The resulting improvement in picture quality may extend the use of portable EJ VTR equipment into new programming areas."
"Sixteen-millimeter soundtrack tests were conducted to determine the carrier frequency of cross-modulation signals that would correlate best with listening tests and the maximum amount of cross-modulation distortion that would be acceptable to listeners. Results show that a carrier frequency of 8.5 kHz should be used for cross-modulation tests on 16mm films and that 3% cross-modulation distortion (-30-dB cancellation) is probably a reasonable maximum distortion for acceptable soundtrack quality."
"This report, submitted as part of the Progress Committee Report For 1975, was received too late for translating for publication in the May 1976 Journal (see p. 269). We are pleased to present it here as addendum to the Progress Committee Report."
"Syntha Vision is a computer animation process for producing realistic images of solid objects. The system employs a digital-computer simulation of the photographic process, in that three-dimensional shapes, reflection properties, light sources, and camera lenses are all mathematically represented within a large general-purpose computer such as an IBM 360/65. The physical laws of reflection are then used to compute the image that would be produced on film if all these elements really existed. Controlled motion is obtained when the “film director” uses a specially designed computer input language to create a set of simple instructions defining the frame-to-frame motion of the “objects” as they would appear to the camera. The computed pictures, generated in digital form on magnetic tape, are processed by a digital-to-analog converter which drives a high-resolution cathode-ray tube; the CRT images are then photographed by a conventional animation camera. Using an actual project as an example, we describe the important steps in producing a Syntha Vision film. Because the computer does no more than follow the instructions of the film director, all of the creative steps normally involved in animated film design are still completely under human control."
"A complete system is described for cueing two or more crystal-sync cameras by using a small dedicated minicomputer to store information about the running and stopping of the cameras. On command, any number of cameras may be switched on and off by the cameramen, at random, throughout a continuous program. The recorded data can later be decoded and applied as visual information to the magnetic soundtrack for editorial handling. A feature of this technique is the fact that at every stage, the only equipment needed other than the dedicated minicomputer is standard film equipment."
                "Where a channel has a limited data rate or a digital store has a limited capacity, it is sometimes essential to reduce the data rate of pulse-code-modulated color television signals. One direct way of doing this is to lower the encoding frequencyfs, but the Nyquist sampling limit is soon reached and further reduction results in beat distortions due to “alias components” when the lower sidebands of fs overlap the baseband video frequencies. NTSC television signals can be digitally encoded at sub-Nyquist rates by placing the alias components into those parts of the spectrum not normally occupied by the luminance or chrominance components of the video signal. By the proper choice of comb filters (two types are specified), most of the alias signals can be removed from the baseband video. In the system examined, fs is exactly 2fsc + 1/4 fh or 2fsc — 1/4fh, where fsc is the NTSC color subcarrier frequency and fh is the line-scan frequency. Comb filtering is done between fs — f, v and fv where fv, is the baseband video bandwidth. Frequency response equalization is performed within the comb-filtered frequency band. Two modifications to the basic system were studied: using constant vertical quadrature phase sampling and performing comb filtering prior to digital encoding. Color slides and test waveforms encoded by this technique were viewed and found to be subjectively acceptable."
"Specific standards on Broadcast Audio Facilities have existed for some 20 years, and yet there is still widespread confusion in the industry regarding terms such as program level, peak program level, volume units, etc. These are discussed and illustrated with the output of an audio console as an example. Volume indicator (VU meter) principles are discussed and compared with those of a Peak Program meter. A special measuring technique (using the Program Level Tone Burst signal) is introduced to measure the harmonic distortion of facilities that can not carry sustained tone signals. Finally a few hard and fast rules are presented that come to grips with some of the terms and some of the jargon used in audio broadcasting."
"The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) code is the computer industry's standard for information interchange. This paper recommends the serial 8-bit ASCII code, its standard transmission techniques, and its derivatives as methods for recording time-code data on tape and film. A similar approach has already been implemented for videotape, and a new time-code system is now needed to facilitate production encoding, post-production decoding, and control of mixing and editing equipment in the film industry as well. One proposed derivative of the ASCII code, the frequency-shift-keying (FSK) modulation scheme, can be used with unmodified conventional recording and motion picture equipment. The most sophisticated derivative, the asynchronous-pulse-width-modulation (APWM) code, meets all the performance requirements of a time code for tape and film. The derivatives can be easily converted from one to another, which offers the advantage of inexpensive interface. The proposed codes have been developed for use with minicomputers, microprocessors, and standard data terminals. An integrated-circuit Motorola M6800 microprocessor is presently being used to generate and read time codes recorded on film and tape. The combination of the ASCII code and the microprocessor has resulted in a system that is “intelligent” and versatile and yet has substantially fewer parts than other systems."
"The 110 papers presented at this Congress included a representation of wellestablished techniques used in conjunction with the newest and most sophisticated advancements in equipment. Titles and authors of these papers are given below. Summaries or abstracts of several of the papers are also provided, grouped under session titles. The papers reviewed in the December 1974 issue of the Journal are noted again here."
              "In the October 1933 issue of the Journal, Dr. Loyd A. Jones published “A Historical Summary of Standardization in the Society of Motion Picture Engineers.” This paper gave a review in considerable detail of the standardization activities of the Society since its founding in 1916."

"The worldwide television systems of 1976 evolved from a laboratory demonstration of crude but recognizable images just 50 years earlier. Ideas and concepts for television date back another 51 years. — The development of television progressed through an early experimental stage in which mechanical-scanning schemes were soon overtaken and turned aside by electronic systems. This led into a period of experimental broadcasting and to the establishment of broadcasting standards. After an interruption by World War II, expansion took place rapidly. During the same period, a confrontation between alternate systems for color transmission served ultimately to expedite establishment of the compatible color standards in use today. — Introduction of the successful transverse-scan videotape recording system in the mid-1950s immediately began reshaping television broadcasting and production techniques. This process is still actively taking place, tape competing head-on with film for certain production recording applications. — A period of refinement and improvement of studio and transmitter technical facilities began after tape recording became established. Solid-state technology, computer techniques, and the continuing evolution of camera-tube technology—all made important contributions in this process. Colorization of broadcasting facilities, responding to a delayed awakening of audience interest took place between 1965 and 1970. — In the most recent half decade, the updating and improvement programs have evolved into wide-ranging application of newer technology. Digital processing of video signals, in particular, has made possible new modes of operation in television production, newsgathering, and broadcasting. New methods of program distribution have entered, or are about to enter, the marketplace in their bids for public acceptance. Clearly, television technical history continues in the making."
"Technology and its history is the all consuming avocation and advocation of all serious engineers, this one included. And the history of the technology in the motion-picture industry has an added dimension of glamor that makes it all the more exciting. — To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the SMPTE, I've been asked to do an update on an article on the history of the motion picture camera (that was co-authored by myself, E. C. Manderfeld and George A. Mitchell) originally published in the 50th Anniversary Issue of the SMPTE Journal (July 1967). While I wrote the original article from the vantage point of Vice President of Engineering for Mitchell Camera Corp. — one of the premier professional motion-picture camera companies that traces its beginnings to the start of the motion-picture industry early in this century — I now write from the vantage point of President of Cinema Products Corp., the company that I founded only eight years ago. Now, as then, I will attempt to approach my subject in an unbiased and objective manner. — In that first article, I dwelt exclusively on the large-screen formats and equipment therefor. I feel it is appropriate, and indicative of the technological progress made in the development of film stocks, that this article deal not only with new developments in 35mm equipment but also with the enormous strides in technology that have occurred in the 16mm field. I will draw the line there, however, and save for my next paper any discussion on super-8 camera equipment as it relates to professional cinematography. — This has been a decade of amazing progress and growth in the development of new professional motion-picture camera equipment. As we have found, technology advances in a geometric progression rather than arithmetic, and this has been no less true in the professional motion-picture equipment field."
"The past 45 years of professional motion-picture camera design are reviewed by the authors whose personal participation spans this period which started with the hand-cranked cameras. There were cameras that punched perforations, and the motor-driven and silent-sound-stage cameras, including many wide-screen processes. Many of the failures as well as successes are discussed, including three-dimensional and wide-screen anamorphic photography. The influence that our defense and space efforts have had on the design of motion-picture cameras can be seen in the development over the past decade of high-speed cameras of both the pin-registered and rotating-prism type. Miniaturization and rugged construction requirements have influenced motion-picture camera design. Developments in optics, film manufacture and electronics are influencing the design of cameras already on the drawing boards, and work now being done in electronic beam recording promises revolutionary camera designs."
"With the invention and development of the motion-picture film projector in the late eighteen hundreds there came a need for long lengths of a flexible transparent film support which could be coated with photographic emulsion to provide rolls of positive and negative film. As a result of close cooperation between George Eastman and Thomas A. Edison a film support made from cellulose nitrate was developed. A Kodak chemist, Harry M. Reichenbach, formulated the first successful base coating composition in 1889.1"
"Man's interest in the use of color for visual presentation goes back in history to his earliest known attempts at pictorial representation. Its use has persisted in his art and architecture, costume and decoration up to the present time. It was only natural that it should be introduced into his entertainment, games, pageant plays and finally motion pictures. — The first attempts to produce color in motion pictures were crude and far from realistic. Many color systems were invented, developed and used, only to be abandoned when other systems emerged that were preferable from a technical or commercial standpoint. In the course of slightly more than sixty years, the names of over one hundred color processes have appeared in motion-picture advertising and on the theater screens. All of the processes were not individual processes, some were merely names given by a producing company or laboratory to an existing process and still others were foreign films that utilized a process popular in the country in which they were produced. Elimination of the name only and the foreign processes leave approximately fifty which originated or were used in the United States. Each of these systems has contributed to the technological advancement of motion pictures through photographic chemistry and/or optics."
"On 6 May 1954, at the SMPTE Convention in Washington, D.C., J. I. Crabtree of the Kodak Research Laboratories presented a paper covering the history of the motion-picture laboratory which was published in the January 1955 issue of the Society's Journal. Mr. Crabtree's excellent coverage of the origins of the motion-picture laboratory in the early 1890s and of the changes in technology that were introduced through the years up to 1954 is invaluable so it seemed obvious that his paper should be the introduction of the present survey. Here we reproduce the first page of his paper, and the reader is referred to the January 1955 Journal issue for a detailed account of the evolution of the laboratory."
"This paper presents a step-by-step outline of the many problems encountered and the ingenious solutions developed before the optically recorded photographic soundtrack as we find it today on the release print could become a practical reality. Starting with the first attempts to record sound on cylinders, disc or film, the authors catalog and illustrate the challenges, the difficulties and the technologies which overcame them, the important turning points, and the finally established and surviving systems. (The early developments of magnetic sound recording are covered in a companion paper in this issue by Loren Ryder.) A copious array of bibliographic references permits the more interested reader to delve deeper into the history of motion-picture sound recording."
"During the “Battle of the Bulge” in World War II, General George S. Patton's forces captured two tape recorders from the German Army Intelligence. One was sent to the Signal Corp Sound & Motion Picture Headquarters on Long Island where it was reviewed by Colonel Ranger, and one was sent to the Washington, D.C. Naval Research KL Sound Laboratory at Anacostia where it was reviewed by myself and others."
"The author presents an evocation of the most important steps in the development in Europe of sound-recording techniques suitable for recording on film. It is interesting to note that, in many ways, the evolution of experiments in sound-recording techniques ran parallel to that in the United States. On the other hand, in some areas, radically different routes were traveled. An interesting example of highly original inventive thinking was the hot-cathode microphone, called Kathodophone. It is also noteworthy that the Kerr cell, which in the United States was not believed to be useful for sound recording, was in routine, practical use in the German motion-picture industry for many years before, finally, the mirror-galvanometer won out over it in Europe too as the most practical light modulator. Glimpses of the origins of magnetic recording are also given. Altogether, the paper contains good information, complementary to the development of sound recording in the United States."
"Set lighting equipment over the past fifty years has been influenced by innovations in areas such as film characteristics, sound and various production techniques. The equipment selected for attaining dramatic and artistic lighting effects is an important factor contributing to the success of both motion-picture and television productions. The dimming effects of the present energy crisis may be overcome in the future by the introduction of more efficient light sources. — This paper is a revision of the “History of Motion-Picture Set Lighting Equipment” by M. A. Hankins, which was published in the July 1967 Journal. Developments in past and present equipment are discussed."
"Quoting from the introduction to the fourth edition of Motion Picture Projection, by James R. Cameron: — “In the spring of 1923 S. L. Rothafel, ‘Roxy,’ of the Roxy Theater in New York City addressed the Society of Motion Picture Engineers and made a prophecy. He said that a marked advance in projection would take place in the next five years, in the machinery and equipment used for the projection of motion pictures in the theater. — “‘We are dreaming wonderful things,’ he said. ‘We are visualizing marvelous projects. The work of the past is but the stepping stone to something much finer and better. Today motion pictures do not constitute an art. They are the result of the fusion of varied abilities. But wedded in the future to light, color, music and scents [sic], they will come to be the highest expression of art that we shall know.‘”"
"CANADA HAS BEEN INVOLVED in the film industry since its inception in North America and has played an important role in developing this means of communication."
"A comprehensive history of instrumentation and high-speed photography does not exist in the published literature and space limitations preclude the possibility of such treatment here. Primary emphasis will be placed on those historical developments that relate to the Society and the role it has played in the growth of the field. Highlights in the early history of instrumentation and high-speed photography have been described in some detail by Smith (1952)1 and Eisendrath (1966).2 Unfortunately, there is some redundancy of other works in this report, but it is thought necessary to include this background information as historical perspective to events that follow. The reader is referred to the above authors and the references cited at the end of this article for more detailed information and trends pertaining to specific subjects of interest."
"In 1916, according to the Constitution and Bylaws of the SMPTE, there were four membership grades of which the most important were Pioneer Members, defined as those who were “in the art as principals 15 years or more antedating the time of the organization of the Society,” and Honorary Members who were required to have been active in the industry for more than 10 years."
"“The SMPTE has been involved in education almost since the days of its founding.”"
"When one seeks to delve into the history of the motion picture industry during the period we usually refer to as “formative”-the space of time during which the inventions upon which the future success of the industry would be based were in process of discovery-one is immediately confronted with many apparently conflicting claims."
     "One of the foremost concerns of broadcasters today is the impact of recent advances in equipment design and performance on television newsgathering. In fact, it is seldom that technological developments have so significantly influenced the future of an entire segment of the broadcasting industry. Recognizing the importance of this aspect of television news reporting, the SMPTE devoted a full day and evening at the 10th Annual Winter Television Conference this year in Detroit to an intensive coverage of the subject."
"At this session, we want to discuss some of the aspects the process of getting into electronic news gathering. As you know, this process is being referred to in various different ways: E.J.; ENG; Mini-Cam; etc. If I may, I would like to call it E.J. since that is the name I find easiest to remember."
"WAGA-TV wasn't the first station to become active in the Electronic Newsgathering field. However, with six months or so of varied experience under our belts this report may be of interest, especially to those who may be in a position similar to ours; that is - a combined transmitter/studio operation with a tall tower located five to seven miles from the points which generate maximum day-to-day news activities."
"During the eight years since the original Minicam, a proliferation of small color cameras has shown the tremendous utility of a broadcast quality camera that can be carried on the back and shoulders of a strong cameraman. The recent upsurge in electronic news gathering ENG has generated the need for a camera with the weight and operating simplicity of a movie camera, so that the cameraperson can be chosen for his or her journalistic ability rather than for sheer strength and technical competence. The Microcam described in this paper was developed by the same CBS Laboratories–now Thomson-CSF Laboratories–CBS Television Network team that developed the Minicam and the project benefited greatly from that experience. The project originated under the CBS Corporate Research Program and later was jointly sponsored by Thomson-CSF S. A. and the CBS Television Network."
"The Ikegami HL series of hand-held color cameras is the most widely used camera of this type in the world today. More than 300 sets of these have been sold and they are being used by US broadcasters, including all three (3) networks."
"The TK-76 Television News Gathering Camera as described at the ll7th SMPTE Technical Conference in Los Angeles in September 1975 is shown in Figure 1. It is a small, lightweight 0 single package camera requiring only the application of a nominal 12 volt battery to generate fully encoded color signals. Shown around the cameraman's waist is a battery belt which is considered the normal source of power for the portable, man-carried, application. Since September, the product design has been completed and the camera is now in its first production cycle."
"NEC placed emphasis on increased reliability and stability as the basic design concept for developing completely self-contained color camera for ENG. The result of examinations led us to think that power consumption reduced to the minimum and reduced heating are the prime requirements to realize the above aims. For without attaining those requirements, miniaturization of camera and driving over long period through battery those are essential for ENG camera are impossible. NEC owes it to NHK that NEC introduced the technical direction of “μ-POWER” as the fundamental design philosophy. Under the joint effort with NHK, NEC started development of μ-Power LSI of Process Amplifier in the summer of 1974 and the test product was developed in the spring of 1975. This product clearly indicated the possibility of LSI'd video circuit. with this knowledge, NEC expanded the scope of development of LSI including encoder, preamplifier, synchronizing system and deflection system to develop next generation color camera and the prototype of μ-Power LSI'd color camera was developed in October 1975. Commercialized first lot will be completed in the spring of 1976. The prototype camera is 3-tube color camera employing 2/3ʺ Plumbicon* that power consumption is approximately 25 W."
"Industrial and educational users associated with helical scan recording techniques are familiar with the extremely rapid rate manufacturers have been able to develop new products to meet non-broadcast applications. In fact, the technology in the helical scan market has moved so fast in the last ten years that some criticism has been voiced by users that technological obsolescence is assured within a year or two for industrial buyers. As an ex-product manager, I can empathize with the industrial user who has recently made a large cash outlay for video equipment only to find that newer and better equipment is in the offing a short time later. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the free enterprise pursuit of customers has benefited the industrial user tremendously through the development of a high quality, more reliable, and less expensive bevy of video products."
"The Canadian Domestic communication satellite ANIK has now been in broadcasting distribution service for three years and, during that period, there has been a large expansion from the initial utilization. The main thrust to date has been providing a program distribution service, but some experimentation has been done in what can be better termed program production, utilizing unique capabilities offered by satellite."
"I'm certainly delighted and pleased, and flattered, to be invited here this year again, as last year, at this marvelous love-feast of electronic camera manufacturers and performers of ENG. I'm really a little puzzled at why I have been invited. Is there some peculiar FCC rule that requires you to have a token minority film man in your midst?"
"Over the years, two-way communications systems have continued to grow in their operating flexibility and mobility. The vehicle mounted radio has given way to the smaller, lower power radios. With communications associated with the person rather than the vehicle, entry into an apartment building, basement, garage or shopping center never leaves the user without communications to his base station. This increased mobility has placed additional demands on the coverage requirements."
"Electronic News Gathering (ENG) has produced a requirement for Microwave Antennas that are Adaptable, Reliable and Reasonable in price."
"The Electronic News Gathering (ENG) concept has become an accepted method for television broadcasters to provide better and faster presentations of significant events to their viewers. ENG allows remote live events transmission to the studio for immediate taping or broadcasting."
"A small lightweight, battery powered, portable tape recorder is the heart of Electronic Journalism at NBC. The Video Tape Recorder (VTR), Sony type V03800, uses 20 minute 3/4ʺ cassettes. The helical scan format is commonly known as U-Matic, under the SONY trade name. The cassette feature of this equipment has proved to be particularly suitable for the highly mobile fast moving use that Electronic Journalism demands. The Edit Rooms at the studios are equipped with Sony V02850 Video Tape Recorders which are used both for direct playback to air and for editing."
"Examining television news gathering trends in the United States over the past year it becomes apparent that in many areas video tape is beginning to replace film as the preferred storage medium for news gathering applications. As a result of this trend, direct comparisons of size, weight, cost, shooting ratios, editing capability, etc., are a topic of serious discussion throughout the broadcast television industry."
"I'd like the opportunity now to introduce the panel and then I have a couple of instructions as to the way we'd like to conduct the session in order to get the most value out of it. Starting on my left is Hugo Bondy whom you're familiar with from an earlier paper today. Hugo is a Chief Engineer of WAGA, Atlanta. Next to Hugo is Jim Kitchell, Manager of NBC News Services Division. Next to Jim is Torn Battista, Executive Vice President of the Columbia Television Stations Division. Adjacent to Torn, we have Ray Schneider, Director of Special projects Engineering & Development, Columbia Television Network. On my right is John Tallerico, WLIX, Lansing and Jackson, Michigan, Director of News. Next to John is Charles Kotcher, Chief Engineer at WXYZ, Detroit, ABC owned and operated. Ray Smith, next to Charlie, is Manager of Engineering, WKYZ, Cleveland; and at the end of the line we have Charles Meyer, Supervisor of ENG at WBBM-TV, Chicago, CBS owned and operated."
"This standard describes the International System of Units (SI), the modern version of the metric system. It includes listings of the base units, supplementary units, and units derived therefrom. Guidance is provided on application of the SI prefixes, other units in use with SI (including units accepted for limited use and units to be abandoned), and unit selection. A section on style and usage covers the writing of unit symbols and names, pronunciation, and recommendations for numbers. Extensive guidance is provided on conversion and rounding including tables for conversion of linear dimensions, also pressure and stress, along with a very extensive table of conversion factors. An appendix provides background information in the development of SI."
"This standard prescribes the requirements for the design, construction, test, and installation of electric penetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures for stationary nuclear power generating stations. The requirements for external circuits which connect to penetration assemblies are beyond the scope of this standard."
 "This document provides guidance for preoperational testing of Class 1E Power systems for nuclear-power generating stations. The extent of the system shall be that covered by IEEE Std 308-1974, \"Standard Criteria for Class 1E Power Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations.\" The power systems include both AC and DC supplies but do not include the equipment which utilizes the AC and DC power."
"The purpose of this standard is to establish uniform procedures for the measurement of radiation of radio noise from overhead power lines with meters that conform to American National Standards. A uniform procedure is a prerequisite to comparisons of radio-noise performance of various overhead power lines. The procedure applies in the frequency range of 0.015 to 30 MHz. A procedure for measurements in the frequency range of 20 to 1000 MHz, which is to be used only as a guide, is also presented."
"Telephone companies and equipment manufacturers have generally agreed on a definition for longitudinal balance for many years. This agreement extends also to the basic approach followed when measuring balance. Testing a device for balance involves the application of a longitudinal voltage. Then any resulting metallic voltage is measured, and the ratio of the two voltages is used to develop a balance number.Unfortunately, agreement has ended at about this point. A number of different test circuits are used by different segments of the telephone industry. Although all of the existing test circuits have some merits supporting their use, the mere existence of varied circuits leads to differences in test results.In addition to differences related to the test set, test conditions and procedures can also affect the result. When an item of equipment is to be tested, there is often a test set or procedure,or both, capable of giving any desired result.Agreement on one way of testing for longitudinal balance has been sought. This standard represents such agreement. It defines the basic requirements of a standard test circuit. Reasonable tolerances are included so that a test-set designer will find considerable latitude to make the set his own way. Besides defining the requirements for a test circuit, this standard includes test conditions and procedures that must be established and followed. As a result, all test sets designed and used in accordance with the standard will produce the same balance number for a given test specimen. Similarly, comparing balance numbers for different devices will become more meaningful when all come from tests meeting the standard."
"Radar systems operate in frequency bands that since World War II have been identified by letter designations. Over a period of time these frequencies and their associated letter-band designations have been fixed by usage. In order to recognize and preserve accepted usage, this standard defines the letter-band nomenclature to be used as a convenience for describing the frequency in which radar operates. It should be cautioned that these are not a substitute for the specific frequency limits of a radar, nor is it meant that these letter bands be applied to other than radar."
"This standard applies to enclosed low-voltage ac power circuit breakers as described in American National Standard for Low-Voltage AC Power Circuit Breakers Used in Enclosures, C37.13-1973 (IEEE Std 20-1973), except that the circuit breakers discussed in this standard incorporate current-limiting fuses as an integral part of the circuit breaker. The entire device thereby becomes capable of interrupting shortcircuit currents up to 200 000 A rms and may be applied on circuits where the available short-circuit current does not exceed that amount."
"A list of graphic symbols for the designation of electrical, electronic, and pole line devices for layout drawings of cable television (CATV) systems is provided. This standard does not use reference designation and class designation letters."
"The Dataway defined in IEEE Std 583-1975, Modular Instrumentation and Digital Interface System, is the basis for all CAMAC* systems. It provides the means of interconnection between modules and a crate controller within one crate. This standard defines the CAMAC Parallel Highway Interface System for interconnecting up to seven CAMAC crates (or other devices) and a system controller. The Parallel Highway, so called because the data bits are transmitted along the Highway in parallel, is capable of handling higher data rates than nonparallel highways. However, in some applications, for example, where there are long distances between crates or where simplicity of interconnections is particularly important, the Serial Highway of IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System (CAMAC), may be more suitable.This standard defines the signals, timing, and logical organization of the connections from crate controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers to the Parallel Highway through a standard connector. The internal structures of crate controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers, and the physical construction of the Parallel Highway System are defined only where they affect compatibility between parts of the system."
"This application guide for the relay protection of squirrel-cage and wound-rotor induction motors and synchronous motors presents a review of the generally accepted forms of motor protection and summarizes the use of relays and devices, singly and in combination, so the reader may select the necessary equipment to obtain adequate motor protection. The guide is concerned primarily with the protection of three-phase integral horsepower motors and refers to two-phase motors only in special instances where specifically indicated."

"After a discussion of the concepts of ageing of insulations and of the endurance of insulating materials, the importance of verifying the relevance of ageing to insulation failure in equipment is pointed out. Information regarding frequency distributions of service stresses and of the stress dependence of insulation strength is also required. After a discussion of ageing versus changes of property, problems of evaluating the endurance of insulating materials, functional testing of insulation systems, and of the acceptance testing of equipment insulation are briefly reviewed. The paper concludes by recommending certain areas which should be studied in order to improve rational, consistent and economic evaluation methods."
"Results are presented of investigations into the thermal ageing behaviour of cellulose paper insulation in which tests at temperatures of between 100 °C and 160 °C have been carried out on well-dried samples of cellulose paper contained in sealed glass vessels in an atmosphere of initially dry nitrogen gas. The degree of ageing has been assessed by measuring the time rate of decrease of several physical and physico-chemical characteristics of the cellulose paper, e.g. burst strength, degree of polymerisation etc., and conclusions drawn concerning their relative sensitivities to the state of ageing of the test sample. In addition to these measurements the rates of production of the main gaseous decomposition products have also been determined. This work is preliminary to a more extensive investigation into the effects of ageing, both thermal and electrical, on the life of oil-filled cable insulation and the present results are discussed in this context."
"The basic concept of the test method and its main advantages are recalled in the first Section. In particular, it is noted that the test technique used by us allows determination of the “intrinsic” value of voltage endurance. In the second Section many data pertinent to some of the most important plastic insulating materials are reported. It is so possible to make an interesting comparison among these materials."
"A model for the life of a high tension polymer insulator material was postulated to be dependent on the temperature (T), ultraviolet (U.V.) radiation (I), energy of activation (E), gas law constant (R) as: Life Ln(L)=c + E−BI/RT, where c and B are constants. This model was derived by modifying the Arrhenius equation of reaction rates to r =A − E−BI/KT to take into account U.V. radiation. The validity of the model was verified by accelerating the failure of the insulator material under controlled degrading factors in an environmental chamber. The correlation between the experimental results and the postulated model is excellent. Such a model for life with parameters determined experimentally gives a means of estimating life of insulator material at ambient temperature and average U.V. radiation of sun."
"Thermal endurance test results on polyhydantoin film are presented, performed both in the conventional atmospheric conditions and in the conditions fulfilling the requirements for the equalized ageing process. The basic principle of the Equalized Ageing Process method (EAP) for thermal endurance testing of solid electrical insulating materials is to make the ageing process at the test temperature equal to that at the service temperature, by changing the test atmosphere appropriately. In an equalized ageing process all the chemical ageing reactions are accelerated equally."
"Accelerated thermal aging tests according to ASTM D3032 were used to predict life expectancies of major appliance hookup wires having PVC insulations."
"A short review of the constructive solutions generally adopted in recent years in manufacturing high voltage current transformers is given, and the problems involved in designing the insulation of such equipment are discussed."
"This paper presents thermal aging data on a largely inorganic insulation system for dry-type transformers."
"Thermoplastic rubbers represent a new class of polymers whose properties and processing behavior make them ideal products for many wire and cable applications. In the last few years several polymers of this type have become commercial. Although they differ chemically, they all combine thermoplastic processability with many of the properties of vulcanized rubber. This combination of flexibility, toughness and high speed processability can mean increased profits through lower operating cost, lower capital equipment costs, and product line simplification."
"As a candidate of impregnant which exhibits better compatibility with polypropylene-based sheets insulation, many kinds of ethers involving phenyl and/or aryl groups are synthesized in laboratory scale to be estimated on their physico-chemical and dielectric properties. Though they surely possess a dielectric absorption due to dipole orientation, their dielectric loss factor is in extremely low level at power frequency above the temperature of −50°C, as far as the sufficient purification is achieved. Taking account of major requirement for cable or capacitor application, selected are nonyl phenetole, hexylphenyl phenyl ether and n-tetradecylphenyl phenyl ether as a promising dielectric. Subsequent determination indicates that three types of aryl ether offer more desirable balance between physical and dielectric properties and favourable compatibility with polypropylene film, rather than dodecylbenzene and polybutene. Consideration is additionally given to their compatibility with polypropylene on the basis of the extended solubility parameter concept."
"Power cables designed for 115-KV and above require a relatively thick insulating wall that results in a large overall cable diameter and a large volume of insulation per foot of conductor, A typical 138-KV cable may be made with an insulating wall of nearly one inch. The radial electric stress in this insulation is a maximum at the strand shield-insulation interface and decreases (inversely with radius) to the insulation-insulation shield interface. By using two or more dielectric layers with different dielectric constants one can reduce the maximum electric stress near the strand shield."
"On the manufacturing process of a submarine coaxial cable, a multitroughs water cooling system is adapting to avoid the voids forming and to strengthen the gripping force between the insulating polyethylene and a center conductor."
"The apparent increase of the capacitance of solid/ liquid insulations measured at very law frequency under law voltage (∼1 volt), is mainly produced by the appearance of polarization layers (ions are impeded at the interfaces) provided that adequate conditions be fulfilled for the densities and mobilities of ions, and for the frequency and amplitude of the applied voltage. Thus, the insulation behaves approximately as a capacitance (the capacitance of the polarization layer, which may reach same) µF/cm2, a value frequently encountered in Electrochemistry) in series with the resistance of the dielectric (which shunts the geometrical capacitance measured at high frequency)."
"The ideal composition of fibers for insulating paper has been clarified by investigating the influence of the shape of fines on dielectric and tensil breakdown of oil-impregnated Kraft paper for OF cable (at oil pressure 1kg/cm2). Furthermore, the pulp refining methods for producing such insulating paper has been developed."
"An extensive study has been carried out on the response characteristics of RCL-type corona detectors as a function of cable length, using terminated and unterminated XLPE insulated distribution power-cable specimens. The corona detection circuit response was examined both in the time and frequency domains, utilizing calibration pulse rise times between 0.1 and 20 µs. Particular attention was given to errors arising with unterminated cable specimens and the techniques on how these may be eliminated with suitable high voltage terminations. The transition between lumped circuit and distribution parameter or transmission line behavior was also considered."
"The advantages of direct-current (DC) over alternating-current (AC) for the transmission of electric power have long been recognized. Considering the transmission line per se, and neglecting terminal equipment, the advantages of DC are overwhelming, and include the following: 1. Improved utilization of the transmission corridor or cable. 2. Complete control over power flow. 3. Absence of phase-angle or synchronization problems. 4. Absence of line reactance problems."
"The structure and shape of the coils in high-voltage apparatus have a pronounced effect upon their electrical life expectancy because of the dielectric stress concentration at the edges and corners of the conductors. In these regions, as a result of the high dielectric stress, accelerated damage to the insulation can occur due to the partial discharges on the surfaces and in minute voids created during manufacture or in service. The extent of the influence of these increased stresses on the electrical life expectancy of several types of epoxy-mica insulation for large electrical machines was investigated."
"Insulation system characterization in industry, through work in IEEE and IEC, is evolving from thermal aging functional tests to multi-stress aging functional tests. The latter approach includes all significant aging factors, affecting the insulation systems of specific equipment, in the functional test programs. The technical basis for using these complex tests and considerations in designing and interpreting them are reviewed, based on the experience obtained in using multi-factor tests, to evaluate the insulation systems of medium-size turbine generators in the author's company. The relationship of these tests to single-factor functional and materials properties tests is discussed."
"The degree of dependence on voltage endurance tests as an important property of high voltage insulation quality has recently increased, due to its wide-spread use by Manufacturers and Utilities."
"Tests were conducted to predict remaining electrical insulation life of a polyimide-epoxy insulated 60 kW form-wound homopolar inductor generator following completion of 23,130 hours of turbo-generator endurance tests. The generator stator was sectioned to provide five sections, designated statorettes, and to permit 33 coil dielectric measurements on each section. Thermal aging tests were conducted on each section at select elevated temperatures to establish an Arrhenius life-temperature plot for end-life prediction and product or application use."
"Many techniques have been proposed for the elimination of the ring of corona which can occur just outside the slot of high voltage stator coils. The aim of this work was to evaluate these voltage grading methods to determine the most practical methods of accomplishing this objective for machines rated above and below 16 KV. For operating voltages up to 16 KV a single semiconducting silicon carbide paint system of 2.5″ or longer provides excellent corona protection. For higher voltages a multiple paint system or a system composed of two layers of paint separated by insulation is required."
"An extremely sensitive overheating detection technique has been developed using special “sacrificial” coating materials in conjunction with an ion chamber detector or a nuclei condensation monitor. Several distinct “families” of sacrificial coatings based on diazonium compounds, malonic acids, metal acetylacetonates, blocked isocyanates, and special fluorocarbon greases have been formulated for this application."
"From the testing results on the electrical breakdown phenomena of various epoxy micaceous insulations for form-wound coils of a high voltage rotating machine, electrical failure properties such as breakdown voltage and voltage endurance time were analyzed statistically using Weibull distribution."
"Several contributions to the study of empirical correlation between tip-up and insulation life are reviewed, In addition to the published literature some previously unpublished field measurements made by the authors' Company are cited. Some investigators report favorable correlation while others report the contrary. Our own experience on two different insulation systems indicates that the extent and the kind of correlation is dependent on the kind of insulation system which is being evaluated."
"Some problems associated with the drying of large power transformers are studied in this paper. It is shown that the conventional end-of-drying criteria cannot be used as dryness criteria when moisture is deeply embedded in the insulation. The solution proposed here consists in introducing into the drying transformer paper probles that are representative of the transformer insulation, and in monitoring their humidity profiles remotely and continuously during the drying. The presence of unfavorable temperature distributions in the transformer insulation and the deleterious effects of such distributions on the effectiveness of the drying process were clearly evident during field tests with this paper probe arrangement."
"1. Pressed GFRP profiles have proved themselves over years as an insulation for the rotor windings of turbogenerators."
"Discharge initiation phenomena in a liquid-nitrogen-filled cavity were investigated using “a.c. impulse” voltage. It was found that the discharge magnitude in the beginning half cycle of the voltage is generally different from that in the next half cycle time. This phenomenon is discussed in terms of discharge processes and the quantity of discharge-formed bubbles. Overvoltage characteristic of the discharge magnitude was also found in a liquid-nitrogen-filled cavity as in a gaseous-nitrogen-filled cavity."
"The experimental investigation of treeing phenomena of polyethylene at the liquid nitrogen temperature gave following conclusions."
"An investigation into internal discharges in artificial air-filled cavities in impregnated-paper, polythene and polypropylene ueing a multi-channel, pulse-height analyser is described. On lowering the temperature of test samples from 343 K down to that of liquid nitrogen the discharge repetition rate and discharge magnitude under alternating-and direct-voltages are greatly reduced. The electric strength with power-frequency-alternating-, direct-and lightning surge-voltages with polarity reversal, is appreciably increased when the temperature is lowered, the improvement being particularly marked with direct voltages. Operating the electrical apparatus at cryogenic temperatures increases the working voltage, the electric strength and the life time of the electrical insulation."
"Several types of thin-film plastic insulation are being evaluated for possible use in ac superconducting underground transmission cables. The materials include polyolefins, polycarbonates, polysulphones, and nylons, in thicknesses ranging from 25µ to 125µ. Multiple-layer samples of the films are placed between 9.5 mm diameter, spherical stainless steel electrodes, and the film and electrodes encapsulated in epoxy. The epoxy casting is arranged to allow injection of liquid or gaseous helium between the plastic layers, at pressures up to 5 atm and a temperature of 4.2 K. Each casting contains eight pairs of electrodes."
"The design of superconducting transmission cables requires a systems approach which includes consideration of the conductor, insulator, cryogenic envelope and refrigerator. Each component of the system must function satisfactorily without disrupting the other system elements. The cable insulation must meet demanding requirements of breakdown strength, corona inception level and mechanical integrity. But it must accomplish all this without burdening the refrigerator with a heat load due to ac dielectric losses."
"A superconducting cable using helium as the electrical insulation requires rigid insulating support spacers to hold the conductors in position. This paper describes the design and testing of post type spacers for such a cable. The spacers consist of an approximately spherical mass of epoxy or ceramic to serve as the electrical insulation with imbedded conducting inserts to control the distribution of the electric field."
"Magnetic fields in high voltage vacuum insulation are of interest because they may produce cross-field discharges and propel vacuum arcs. This paper shows that the coaxial cable geometry with elbows and high voltage terminations permits neither the gyration of electrons nor the sufficient elongation of electron trajectories to produce a noticeable number of ionizing collisions with residual gas molecules. Experiments with a 10 toot long, 5.75 inch diameter coaxial line did not reveal the theoretically expected are motion away from the current source nor any tendency towards retrograde motion. In a butt-gap geometry, however, the kink instability of the plasma column was found to drive the are rapidly to the electrode edge. A radial magnetic field in the butt-gap enhanced are diffusion and cathode spot tracks indicated a tendency of the plasma to rotate in accordance with the Lorentz force. The beginnings of the new concept of self-sustained ion pumping are outlined. Apparatus for demonstrating this effect utilized permanent bar magnets, titanium cathodes and 60 Hz high voltage."
"The paper summarizes some results obtained recently and relative to different aspects of the electrical bevaviour of a coaxial tape wrapped insulation in helium under high electric stresses and up to breakdown. The effect of various parameters-taping and impregnation- is analysed."
"The last 15 years in the UK have seen a major change in the insulation materials used in both AC and DC rotating machines."
"Novel and economically promising polymer/mica composites have been produced by microwave-plasma irradiation of mica flakes in ethylene prior to incorporation into a polyethylene matrix. These materials have good melt flow properties, favorable filler alignment, and controlled interfacial characteristics. This has prompted us, firstly, to carry out “diagnostic” measurements of the interfacial polarization (Maxwell-Wagner effect) and, secondly, to evaluate these composites from the point of view of their possible interest in high voltage insulation technology."
"A modification or the Cleveland Open Cup Test, ASTM D92, was developed for dielectric fluids in non-fire hazard power capacitors and transformers. This was on the basis of considering fire situations in these apparatus. Two criteria for non-flammability were deduced and applied in this test: that burning may only be initiated at the boiling point, and that burning cease on cooling when separated from the heat source. A number of fluids were tested. Effects of soot are noted."
"A new method for measuring the zeta potential has been developed which exists on the surface of the cellulosic pressboard impregnated with an electrical insulating oil while the oil streams through the capillary holes in the pressboard. The metal salts of di-(2 ethyl-hexyl) sulpho-succinate were dissolved in a purified insulating oil, the zeta potential and AC electric conductivity were investigated. The dependence of the zeta potential on the type and concentration of the salt was clarified. It would be safe to say that in electrical insulating oil the electrokinetic phenomenon could be dealt with in the same manner that it has been dealt with in the aqueous solution so far."
"A newly developed all-polypropylene-film power capacitor is described here. The size of the capacitor is about half that of the conventional types and its dielectric loss is less than one-seventh. We succeeded in this development by studying insulating fluids, films and several factors in the production of capacitors to yield good electrical insulation which is free from voids that occur due to swelling of the film and to imperfect impregnation of the all-film construction."
"Silicone fluids constitute a very diverse family of organosiloxane liquids having the general structure (CH3)3-Si-[O-Si-(R)2]n-0-Si-(CH3)3 in which R may represent almost any organic group. These fluids are coming increasingly in use in dielectric and insulating systems because of their thermal, electrical and chemical characteristics and particularly as they are becoming economically competitive."
"Because of new technical and safety requirements for electrical equipment, silicone liquid is presently being evaluated as a dielectric coolant in transformers. Previous papers have discussed the dielectric properties of the bulk silicone liquid. In this paper, we deal with the dielectric properties of solid kraft paper and aramid paper insulating materials impregnated with silicone liquid."
"This paper reports the results of research aimed at finding a relationship between dielectric strength and other material properties. The variables investigated were dielectric constant, dissipation factor, volume resistivity and glass transition temperature. The “best fit” equation contained only the first three variables. This equation had a correlation coefficient of 0.87. It is proposed that this correlation could be improved if atomic ionization potentials and molecular free volumes were included as variables in the dielectric strength relationship."
"It is well known that the space charge accumulation gives a great influence on both the short-time and long-time breakdown strengths for the de plastic insulation system."
"The investigations of the tree initiation in polyethylene were carried out using the de and the impulse voltages in the rise times ranging from 1µs to 700µs. The results of the impulse voltage supply show that the time required for the build-up of the space charges at the tip of needle electrode at 25°C ∼ 30°C is about 30µs ∼ 80µs. The tree initiation voltages are decreased when the impulse voltage is superposed on the de voltage of the opposite direction and they are increased when the impulse voltage is superposed on the de voltage of the same direction. The specimens are prestressed with the de voltage for 10 minutes, then subsequently are tested using an impulse voltage with the duration of wave front of 1µs after the waiting period of 2, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. The tree initiation voltages are reduced the same as the result of the de superposed tests when the polarity of the impulse voltage is opposite to the de prestressing voltage."
"Although the initiation voltage of the tree at the needle electrode in a plastic with OC voltage is very high, a sort of tree can be formed by earthing the needle after charging it with much lower OC voltage than the initiation voltage. The tree formed by earthing will be called “earthing tree” here. Since the formation of the tree in AC field is considered as the effect of repetition of charging and discharging, some relation may exist between the AC tree and earthing tree."
"This paper describes test methods used to study the phenomenon of electrical treeing in solid dielectrics. Measurements of double needle characteristic voltage and voltage life for a variety of useful dielectric materials are presented. The effects of additives upon treeing in polyethylene are discussed, and evidence is presented which indicates that the ionization potentials of aromatic hydrocarbons determine their behavior as voltage stabilizers."
"The investigations are concerning with voltage stabilizing effects of peroxide decomposition products, measured by treeing resistance."
"The diffusions of water under the electric field and on the thermal gradient are described. Under the basis of this theory, how to prevent water trees is theoretically and experimentally discussed."
"This paper presents an experimental investigation on frequency acceleration of water treeing and on the effect of different factors, such as humidity content, different contaminants, temperature and field strength on tree growth in PE and XLPE. For this investigation model test specimens have been used to supplement cables for testing. Coloured trees and their points of initiation have been analysed for their content of impurity elements and are found always to contain sulphur and some metal."
"It has been pointed out by several authors that the influence of impurity particles on dielectric phenomena in non-solid dielectrics can be in some cases significant, especially for technical liquids."
"Recent transient analysis using a drift dominated conduction model is examined to show the effects of electric field distortion due to space charge on charge transport times and on peak electric field strengths for various excitations, initial conditions and charge injection boundary conditions."
"The general formulae for calculating the potential distribution around an electrostatic point charge in the presence of three different dielectric media, i.e. two semi-infinite media separated by a sheet, are deduced using the image method. The potential is expressed as an infinite series which is shown to be convergent. The number of terms for a reasonable accuracy, for instance 10−3, is usually less than 20. An equivalence between the point charge in the presence of three dielectrics and a point current (linear current density) in the presence of three media with different resistivity is introduced."
"The photoelectric response of high polymers is different in four separate spectral regions. In the infrared, photocapacitive effects occur. In the near ultraviolet, there is injection of electrons and/or holes, with marked dependence upon the electrode material and strong time variations. In the far ultraviolet, interband excitation and photoemission experiments give estimates of band gap (9 eV) and work function (4 eV) which agree with other measurements of these quantities. In the gamma region there are immediate and delayed effects. Trapping of charge may be of importance in these materials, but it is difficult to obtain definitive evidence by optical means. Despite the differences between polymers, and between various samples of the same polymer, there are a surprising number of common features to the optical response."
"A high quality fiber optic light guide design was developed to meet the long term light transmission and electrical requirements necessary for switching solid state HVDC systems. The successful application of light guides up to 60 feet in length has been demonstrated and work is continuing to improve their capability for more extensive use in other HVDC applications."
"It may appear surprising that these important facts have remained undetected during the many years the test of Publication No. 112 has been in use. However, there are two good reasons for that."
"IEC/TC15 is preparing a new edition of Publication 112 concerning a method for determining the comparative tracking index (CTI) of solid insulating materials under moist conditions; the Electrical Engineering Dept., University of Genoa, has performed a set of tests on this subject. A short description of the aims, of the procedure and of the apparatus used for the tests reported in IEC Publ. 112 is given. Several metals have been used for the electrode system to investigate their influence on the tests, and the relevant results are reported. Solutions of different kinds of contaminants have been employed to study particularly the action of wetting agents. Ionic and non-ionic wetting agents have been used, and their effect on solid insulating materials with different surface properties is shown; the action on the drop volume is also taken into account. Oscillographic records of the tracking currents, and photographic records at different stages of the degradation phenomenon have been taken in order to better clarify the different behaviours of the dielectric materials. The obtained results are discussed, and hypotheses on the degradation mechanism are suggested."
"Many previous studies on the phenomena of breakdown in insulating oils suggest that the nature of the interfacial layer at the electrode/oil interface influences the breakdown process 1–3. Same studies also indicate that the cathode plays a more important role than the anode in initiating processes which eventually leads to breakdown 4."
"As part of a programme aimed at the development of a sensor with a rapid response to changes in relative humidity the changes in capacitance and surface conductance fellowing a sudden change in ambient humidity have been recorded for specimens of non-porous aluminium oxide. As the equilibrium water uptake and the consequent changes in capacitance and conductance depend on the relative water vapour pressure and are independent of the total gas pressure, the measurements were made by subjecting the specimens to increasing and decreasing step changes in water vapour pressure in a vacuum system. Capacitive and conductive currents were separated using phase sensitive detection. The resulting responses were not simple exponentials. They suggest that the overall response is determined by the time required for the formation of the adsorbed film and by the time required for equilibrium dissociation to be established."
"Experiments were carried out on wire-tube corona apparatus to measure the sparkover voltage and the maximum pre-sparking corona current with and without heating the discharge electrode. Positive and negative polarities were employed on discharge electrodes of different diameters in clean air at room temperature."
"Corona discharge study has been made considering discharge as a streamer like process. After to have compared the effect of uv radiations and low energy particles like electrons and positive ions, by means of an infrared analysis, experiments have been carried out with ions lower than 30 eV. Though the ions seem to be the more effective particles, their impact did not give a degradation so important as the one due to discharges. An ultraviolet spectroscopy analysis is used to show the presumed increasing conductivity. In conclusion future work on the subject is proposed in order to elucidate the surface transformations and the breakdown of insulating materials. Indeed few results are known on the effect of neutral and negative particles as on the simultaneous ageing of the discharge constituents considered two by two."
"Electrical discharges in various gases may produce chemical species which can cause damage to solide surfaces of different materials. In air, for example, ozone, metastable states of molecular oxygen, atomic oxygen and nitrogen oxides are produced. Furthermore, in the case of corona discharges,those species are pushed in preferred directions by electrical wind. As a matter of fact, in the case of corona discharges, there is an electrical wind 1 resulting from the momentum given to the gas molecules by impact or drag of the ions as they move out of the high field region. The particles of the gas are swept away by this electrical wind towards low field regions and flow around encountered surfaces. The experiments presented in this paper were made with a point to plane system."
"Voltage breakdown is perhaps the most important factor in the performance of electrical equipment in service. At high voltages corona* may lead to voltage breakdown especially over a period of time. In liquid impregnated insulation systems, corona often varies tremendously with time in both magnitude and repetition rate, which complicates both its measurement and the understanding of its influence."
"Failures of high-voltage oil-polypropylene insulated capacitors during operation at 20 kHz were experienced after the capacitors had been filled with new transformer oil. Examination indicated that air pockets trapped in the insulation system during the oil fill had ionized with subsequent damage to the polypropylene. An investigation of the behavior of ionizing air pockets was carried out by means of a model capacitor. A conducting glass electrode permitted visual observation of the conditions in the air pockets. Radically different behavior was noted depending on the type of transformer oil used."
"This paper presents a progress report on a continuing investigation into the voltage endurance of cast and molded resins, particularly cast epoxy resins. The relation of gas cavity size to the observable discharge magnitude and the stress level on the resin at which discharges can be expected to occur within internal cavities is estimated. This illustrates that, with small cavities, the discharge picocoulomb magnitudes can be well below the usual present limits of detection. Experiments with cast resins in which low level discharges exist indicate the trend of discharge magnitude with voltage and time. Continuing voltage endurance tests of specimens with low level discharges indicate a decreasing time to failure with increasing time of ac stress similar to those with surface discharges of much greater magnitude."
"The paper describes the study of simple experimental models of partial discharges. The characteristics of discharges in point to plane gaps with air or air and solid dielectric, in parallel-plane cells with open air gap and solid dielectric or with artificial voids in the dielectric are studied with a view to contribute to a better interpretation of partial discharges in H. V. equipments."
"This paper describes partial discharge tests and evaluations made by Philadelphia Electric Company on solid dielectric extruded cables which were giving unsatisfactory service. Both theoretical calculations and actual measurements are presented and are related to the analyses of the causes of poor cable performance."
"Dielectric high potential testing under partial vacuum can measure or determine the minimum air gap distances between uninsulated inaccesible parts which are inside electrical apparatus such as motors and transformers without exceeding voltage limits for the solid insulation of the system."
"The need for partial discharge (corona) measurements at very low frequencies is explained and the results of tests on epoxy resin samples are given for the frequency range 0.1 Hz to 50 Hz. As no suitable commercial generator was available, a new type of low-frequency low-noise generator has been developed and this is described. The discharge detection system is also explained in the paper. This includes a pulse discrimination system for eliminating unwanted pulses from outside the test component. This was particularly useful when measuring discharges in a short length of cross-linked polyethylene cable, in the presence of discharges over its ends."
"Partial Discharge test is a non-destructive over-potential test which demonstrates the condition of the insulation prior to breakdown. Such a test is assuming greater significance particularly in high voltage apparatus where an economical design of insulation is desirable. Partial discharge tests are being introduced as routine tests for high voltage apparatus. Various methods are in use for partial discharge tests. Of these methods, measurement by discharge detector gives quantitative information. In this paper results of discharge measurements on two typical high voltage coils, one completed motor and a transformer are given. Results of discharge tests on a few typical insulating materials are also given."

          "A method is presented for determining the lost service area of a communications system due to interfering signals of a known origin. Simplification of propagation equations allows the area of protection to be approximated as a circle when a desired signal and an interfering signal are present. The service area geometry may either be circular or rectangular."
        "The Authors consider EMC problems in H.V.substations in which the protection,measurement and control functions are obtained with up-to date solid-state technologies equipment; the system configuration is typical and includes line and transformer bays. The A.,in order to evaluate the problems in a systematic way,consider.the power system and equipment. in it installed,either if H.V.components or for control and supervision, as components of a system for which the compatibility is to be ensured.

 "The corridor concept entails the grouping of power, communications, pipelines, railroads, and highways in one overall right-of-way in order to minimize land usage. This grouping of utilities, while advantageous from a land usage point of view, raises strong technical problems of interference between the utilities. Certainly, the need for any utility corridor concept must assess issues such as land use, environmental, social, economic, aesthetic and legal factors. The technical feasibility aspect, however, must focus on the interaction between the various using utilities and try to determine certain minimum widths for a utility corridor within which these utilities can compatibly operate. In such an evaluation, the effects of various corridor widths have to be analyzed in relation to protective measures and added costs."
  "A simplified estimate is made of the energy coupled to a circuit inside a shielded enclosure. The steps are 1) Estimate maximum values of local electric and magnetic fields on exterior of shield resulting from incident electromagnetic field, 2) Apply known values of Transfer Impedance and Admittance of \"leaky\" areas of shield to determine internal electric and magnetic fields, and 3) Estimate energy coupled to load."
  "Summary form only given. VLF Shielding, below 10 KHz and down to 20-30 Hz, requires design considerations and unique fabrication and installation techniques. The lower the frequency of concern, the more critical the choice of materials and the fabrication and installation of these materials in the high performance VLF shielded room. Since the greatest design and fabrication is with respect to the magnetic component in VLF shielding, this presentation will cover elementary design and performance information with respect to the absorptive losses in both far field and induced near field conditions. All-important in design and fabrication considerations is the reluctance of joints, door seams and other penetrations. Also unique is the honeycomb type of air vents when used as a shield in induced magnetic fields. Power line filters present challenging problems when the frequency of shielding is in the pass band of these filters. VLF shielding and information on the above will be covered with equal attention to the design, selection of materials and fabrication. Illustrations will be given for typical applications for Tempest and EMP requirements."
  "Control Technology in collaboration with the Royal Aircraft Establishment have developed range of active and passive suppressors suitable for airborne use. The work was undertaken to make available an approved range from which suppressors could be selected either for incorporation in new equipment to enable it to comply with the relevant procurement specification or for retrofitting existing aircraft systems. The design of the passivè suppressors is based largely on the work presented at the 1972 IEEE EMC Symposium in the paper \"An Improved Design and Measurement of Attenuation Characteristics of RF Suppressors\" by M L Jarvis. Initially, development was of suppressors having cut-off frequencies which would enable equipment to meet the conducted emission requirements of MIL-STD-461 and BS.3G.100. Both 28 V dc and 200 V 400 Hz ac versions have been produced with a variety of current ratings - up to 10A for the ac suppressors and up to 100A for the dc suppressors. Both \"T\" and \"H\" versions are available. Details will be given in the paper of a BASIC program to evaluate prototype suppressor designs for minimum voltage attenuation or for insertion loss."
"This paper deals with the EMC and Magnetic design and control work carried out on the Transponder section of the spacecraft used in German/US Space Exploration project HELIOS. This project represents a cooperative programme of space research between the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration and The Ministry for Scientific Research of the German Federal Republic."
     "Recent progress made by NASA in applications of advanced composites to aircraft structures is reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to flight service evaluation programs that are or will be accumulating experience with secondary and primary structural components on aircraft. The NASA flight service programs are conducted to obtain practical experience in design, manufacturing and operational considerations for a variety of aircraft components. The primary focus for the programs have been commercial transports. To establish confidence in advanced composites to a point where both transport builders and transport users are willing to make long-term production commitments using composites, NASA has initiated a series of programs to introduce advanced composites into airline fleet service. In implementing this program, initial applications were selective reinforcement of metal components on military aircraft. Small secondary structural components for commercial transports were added to the program; larger secondary components are being fabricated; and large primary structural components are in the design or planning stage. Results will be présented from flight service programs with composite-reinforced metal structures in the CH-54B helicopter tail cone and the C-130 transport aircraft wing boxes. Experience with advanced composite components on the L-1011, B-737 and DC-10 commercial transports will be also reported. A description of future NASA programs that are aimed at composite primary structures in commercial transport aircraft and at development of high-temperature composites technology that may be applicable to future supersonic aircraft will also be reviewed."
"In recent years composite materials have been developed to the point that their strength and weight characteristics make them very attractive as substitutes for metals in various aircraft applications. However, from the electrical standpoint, composites are marginally conductive materials which are capable of supporting only a very minimal current flow, are in many cases capable of providing only marginal shielding and are in some ways unique in their characteristics with respect to electromagnetic fields. The electrical and electromagnetic impact of composites is directly related to the ways in which composites change aircraft characteristics such as lightning protection, shielding effectiveness, electrical systems, antenna operation, static electricity protection and radar cross-section. Because of the change in these various characteristics, weapon system design and development from fuel system, avionics and electrical systems to methods of installation for electrical ground jacks and static electricity dischargers may be significantly affected."
                    "The microprocessor has developed over the last few years into a computer built on a few low cost chips. This has facilitated the use of firmware techniques in many areas where, previously, computer applications were too expensive. Thus it is finding widespread use in digital instrumentation and signal processing; this paper describes a microprocessor in such an application. While sinusoids have traditionally been used in spectral analysis, the bipolar Walsh functions, which also constitute an orthonormal set, are increasingly coming into use in this field. In evaluating the coefficients of a Walsh series, a Walsh spectral analyser has only to accumulate sampled values of the signal. The multiplications involved in Fourier analysis are eliminated, thus simplifying the hardware and increasing the speed. A digital Walsh spectral analyzer, to generate the first 64 coefficients of a periodic signal, has been designed and built."
"This communication intends to set the Walsh-Fourier transform and the concept of sequency in proper perspective with regard to the other Fourier transforms and the concept of generalized frequency. In doing this, it explains some peculiarities of the Walsh functions and the rather unpromising results, in spite of its computational advantages, achieved in many attempts to use the Walsh-Fourier transform in solving engineering problems."
    "An extension of the method of moments (MM) technique predicting the radiation characteristics of extended HF and VHF off-surface radiators on aircraft, is presented. In this analysis, the aircraft fuselage is approximated as a body of revolution. Protruding appendages on the body (such as rotors on helicopters) are treated as parasitic elements. A computer algorithm implementing this approach is used to calculate the power radiated by helicopters equipped with off-surface radiators. The effects of lossy ground planes in vicinity of the aircraft are considered and compared with published range data."
"The geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) is -a high frequency ray optical solution to electromagnetic problems. Using the ray optical approach the radiation from an arbitrary radiator can be described in terms of an astigmatic bundle of rays. By enforcing the conservation of energy, Fermat's principle, and using the velocity of light, one can write an expression for the field at S in terms of the field at 0. Using this concept, one can describe the reflected field from a general curved surface. These two solutions encompass traditional geometrical optics (GO). However, GO lacks generality in solving complex electromagnetic problems in that it does not take into account the diffractions which occur at edges, vertices, and various other discontinuities. Thus, Keller1,2,3 developed in the early 1950s the concept of GTD, which adds these significant diffraction terms to the GO solution. These additional diffraction mechanisms are briefly presented and applied to several practical problems in this paper."
             "A broadband, active, isotropic receiving antenna was developed at NBS for the frequency range 15 kHz to 150 MHz. It was designed for use with a conventional receiver to measure weak, near-zone electric fields of unknown polarization, such as leakage emanations from electronic equipment placed within a shielded enclosure. The antenna system consists of three mutually-orthogonal active dipoles, each 31 cm long by 3 cm diameter. The entire frequency range of each of the three field components is amplified and used to modulate a high-speed light emitting diode (LED) located inside the dipole. The modulated infrared (IR) signals are guided through glass fibers 10 meters long which connect the \"isolated\" dipoles to avalanche photodiodes at the far end of the fiber guides. These photodetectors recover the RF modulation from the IR carrier for input to the receiver. The fiber-optic antenna system described in this paper has high sensitivity (down to 10 μV/m) and fast response time (RF modulations up to 150 MHz). The read-out indication at each receiver frequency is proportional to the Hermitian magnitude of E, which is the root-sum-square value of three orthogonal E field components at the measurement point. The linear dynamic range of the antenna system depends on the receiver bandwidth and signal frequency. It is 70 to 75 dB at frequencies between 0.02 and 2 MHz (for 0.5 kHz receiver bandwidth), 60 to.70 dB between 2 and 25 MHz (for 5 kHz receiver bandwidth) and 40 to 55 dB between 25 and 200 MHz (for 50 kHz bandwidth)."
      "Measurements of the r.f. impedance of the electrical network of cars - observed from several input. points - have been made. Using parameters that were averaged over the measurements, a normalized network - which is equivalent to the electrical system operating either as a disturbing source or as a disturbed load - has been determined. Though the measurements were performed in the frequency range 0.5 - 108.MHz with satisfactory results, the proposed normalized network should be used up to 30 MHz only: a more extensive investigation for frequencies above 30 MHz is necessary."
"During the past 40 years, the automobile industry has taken the lead in initiating and pursuing programs to measure and control electromagnetic interference from vehicles and has sought to assure compatibility of vehicles with other equipment. It has a long and successful history of cooperation in the development and use of standards relating to control of radio frequency emissions. Although the earliest efforts by the industry were aimed at protecting onboard entertainment radios, protection of other communications services has since been given primary consideration as the need for such protection was identified. This presentation will trace the history of the development of the SAE standard for measurement of electromagnetic radiation from motor vehicles from its inception, treating the need for each revision and method of acquiring the data necessary for accomplishing revision. The greatest emphasis will be placed on the latest and most extensive revision of the standard, copies of which will be available at the meeting. The report also will update the status of the SAE measurement procedure in the world community and its relationship to measurement procedures specified by other standards writing groups. Also treated in this presentation will be goals for the future of the standard, one of which is to make it a more internationally acceptable standard."

"The scope of the Piezoelectricity chapter was strongly restricted this year. Previously, material on ferroelectric, pyroelectric, and electrooptical materials had comprised a large portion of the chapter. However, a \"Bibliography of Ferroelectrics\" by Toyoda is published several times a year in the journal Ferroelectrics. Sections covering the periods, March-June 1975 (1) and July-December 1975 (2) appeared this year. Lang publishes an annual \"Literature Guide to Pyroelectricity\" containing a review and a key-word-in-context index in Ferroelectrics. This year's index covered the years 1974- 1975 (3). The literature in electrooptics is included in a separate chapter in the Digest of Literature on Dielectrics. It is believed that these other areas are now adequately covered and that only piezoelectricity should be included in this chapter. The literature used in preparing this review was found by use of Chemical Abstracts~ Science Abstracts~ several computerizedretrieval services, as well as by a study of the major journals. A total of more than 600 references, the majority having appeared in 1976 with a small number from 1975, were found. Out of this total, 271 were selected for review. The material not reviewed included reports for government agencies, relatively inaccessible nonEnglish language publications, more than 75 Japanese patents, and more than 20 Russian patents. Abstracts of all the patents can be found in Chemical Abstracts. The proceedings of two major conferences, published in their entirety in Ferroelectrics~ were a rich source of papers on piezoelectricity and related topics. These conferences were the 1975 IEEE Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 9-11 June 1975 and the Third European Conference on Ferroelectricity held in Zurich, Switzerland on 22-26 September 1975. A large number of papers on applications of electroacoustics were presented at the IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium held in Los Angeles, California on 22-24 September 1975. Relevant papers from these conferences are reviewed in some of the following sections."

"The range of conduction phenomena observed in polyethylene (PE) is quite variable. In ultraclean materials, in which ionic impurities and Poole-Frenkel enhanced ionization are less likely, the currently accepted view is that carriers are injected from the electrodes. Strong experimental evidence that the injected carriers are electrons when contacting polyethylene with a metal comes from the work of Davies1 and more recently from Andress et al.2"
"An electron injection technique has been used to study the transport of electrons in polystyrene. Two electron beams are used in the experiment: one beam injects charge into the free surface of the polymer film, the other beam monitors the surface potential of the film.1, 2 From measurement of the charge deposited and the potential of the surface one infers the average position of the injected charge. From the time dependence of the surface potential and its variation with temperature it is possible to distinguish between the various possible transport mechanism in the polymer."
"Many researchers have investigated the space charge injected into insulators. However, our understanding of space charge phenomena is far from complete. In the present paper, total quantity and mean spatial depth of space charge injected into polyethylene films are measured by the technique of Thermally Stimulated Charge Decay (TSCD). The electric fields at electrode-film interfaces are evaluated."
"An electron beam in passing through a thin solid film may suffer an energy loss, the characteristics of which provide information concerning electronic structure, ionization energy, inter- and intra-band transitions, and plasma oscillations. The energy loss peaks in thin metallic films, e.g., aluminum and also alloys have been studied extensively with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or, as it is now often called, ESCA, meaning electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis). The mechanism of the observed loss peaks in metals may be adequately explained by the plasma oscillation theory due to Böhm and Pines1, using the collective behavior of the valence electrons. During the past few years attention has been devoted to the study of the core and valence levels of a number of polymeric insulators using the ESCA technique (Wood et al.2 and Delhalle et al.3). However, there is still a considerable lack of understanding of the energy loss mechanisms in these materials."
"Recently, fast transient dc conditions were used1 to study charge transport in polyimide film. Although originally interpreted in terms of thermally-assisted electron tunneling, these data were later shown to be consistent with dipolar orientation.2 Thus, information about the nature of charge transport in polyimide film must come from data on steady-state, rather than transient, currents."
"Previous investigations have shown that a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene can be made piezoelectric and pyroelectric by the temporary application of an electric field.∗1, 2 For applied fields in excess of about 250 kV/cm, the electrical response became independent of applied field, independent of poling temperature between 0° and 60°C, and independent of poling time between 5 minutes and 7 hours.1, 2 Such behavior implied saturation of polarization, and values of polarization required to account for the piezoelectric response were well within the maximum to be expected from alignment of dipoles within the crystalline phase of the copolymer. Measurements on similar films now indicate that the polarization distribution within the films is non-uniform and varies with poling temperature. This paper presents these results and will propose a model of charge transfer within the film to reconcile the evidence for saturation polarization and nonuniform charge distribution."
"There are perhaps two primary morphological entities encountered in the crystallization of high polymers; the single crystal, obtained in isolation by crystallization from dilute solution, and the spherulite, the typical form resulting from crystallization from the melt. The single crystal is important as an exemplar of polymeric crystalline order and as a building block of more complex morphologies. A spherulite is a polycrystalline aggregate whose component crystallites possess (in essence) the nature of single crystals; although often small and imperfectly developed in practical circumstances, it is the dominant morphological form in the \"real\" world of molded polymers."
"In recent years a variety of conduction mechanisms have been proposed for natural polyethylene including electrode-limited processes such as field-enhanced Schottky emission,1 or bulk-limited processes such as Poole-Frenkel conduction2, 3 and space-charge limited conduction4–6. While it is generally accepted that carrier migration in high polymers is characterized by a hopping mechanism between localized states, little is known of the nature of these states and the origin of the charge carriers. This paper deals with several aspects of electrical conduction in molded specimens of natural polyethylene and focuses on the effects of applied voltage, temperature, and electrode materials. Detailed studies of the steady-state and transient conduction regimes have revealed that carrier migration appears to be bulk-limited up to at least 2 × 105 V/cm and related to the motion of injected and trapped space-charge through the volume."
"Electrical conduction and breakdown in polymers have been studied for many years. However, even in a simple polymer like polyethylene (PE), there still remain many unresolved questions. Polymers usually consist of crystalline (spherulite) and amorphous parts. Therefore it is necessary to investigate the electrical properties of both the crystalline and amorphous parts if we are to obtain a detailed understanding. In our previous papers,1, 2 we reported that the electron-beam-induced conductivity in polymers consists of fast and slow components. The mobility of fast carriers at the high field has been estimated from time of flight measurements1, 3 in polymers containing π electrons such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PEN (polyethylene naphthalene) and PS (polystyrene) etc. The slow component is related to carriers which migrate through the specimen by a sequence of trapping and detrapping processes. The carrier trapping states were also studied by TSC (thermally stimulated current)4 and TL (thermoluminescence)5 measurements. The quantum yield for the carrier production by the electron bombardment is much smaller in the saturated polymer like PE than in π electron systems,3 which makes measurement difficult in the former material. In this paper, time of flight measurements in PE by pulsed electron beam and simultaneous measurement of TSC and TL will be reported to reveal the carrier transport process and the localized state in PE. The breakdown processes in PE are also discussed in terms of our proposed transport process and trapping states."
"Films of polyethylene were elongated and investigated for the effect on electrical conductivity and breakdown strength of draw ratio. These characteristics of low-density polyethylene are reported here."
"Recently, we have suggested a simple model for conduction in polymeric insulating materials.1–3 The primary aim of developing the model was to improve the prediction of the field dependence of conductivity yielded by earlier models. Our model is based on the assumption that the current flowing through the dielectric is of the same character both at low and high fields, the charge carriers responsible for the current originating in the bulk of the di electric. A three-dimensional Poole-Frenkel effect has been applied to calculate the carrier density enhancement due to high fields; it has been shown that the effect of field on carrier mobility may be neglected up to fields of at least 1 MV/cm. The model yields a formula for the field dependence of conductivity which does not include any freely-disposable parameter:"
"In this brief lecture summary I have attempted to present sufficient background information, together with references, for the uninitiated to get a good grasp of the types of information available from high energy photo-electron spectroscopy (ESCA) and to follow this with a brief outline of areas of application which will be of interest to a meeting whose theme is “Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena.” I will regard this brief review as highly satisfactory therefore if I am able to communicate to the uninitiated some of the exciting prospects for ESCA in the general field covered by this conference."
"A drift-dominated conduction model is often used in conduction analysis where the velocities of charge carriers are proportional to the local electric field through their mobilities, and in turn the electric field is related to the charge densities of the carriers through Gauss's law. Recent work for unipolar ion conduction has obtained generalized solutions for the transient time and spatial responses of the electric field and space charge distributions and for the terminal voltage-current characteristics for any initial and boundary conditions and for any type of terminal excitation or constraint.1–3"
"When one tries to decide whether a given electrical phenomenon in a solid polymer is due to ionic or to electronic effects it often appears that Nature has chosen to be evasive on the issue. Thus, whereas one well done scientific paper may claim ionic effects predominate in a given polymer, the conclusion of another equally competent research report may be that electronic effects are the most important in the same polymer. Sometimes these conclusions are based on solid state theories which have been developed for crystalline materials with relatively well understood defects and then carried over qualitatively to polymers which are structurally much more complicated and which always contain morphologically significant amounts of non-crystalline material. Thus, it is appropriate to investigate models which attempt to account for the inherent inhomogenities of crystalline polymers. This paper summarizes some simple considerations involving the use of electrostatic image theory in conjunction with the Clausius-Mossotti relation to approximate the interaction of ions with the interfaces between crystalline and amorphous regions in polymers."
"In recent years, a number of investigations have been carried out on space charge formation in the bulk of insulating materials from both the physical and engineering points of view. It has been pointed out that the presence of space charge lowers the breakdown strength.1 It is, therefore, important in the case of utilization of dc power cable to investigate methods for preventing space charge formation. The following methods may be effective: (1) increasing the height of the injection potential barrier at the electrode-insulator interface, (2) trapping the major fraction of the charge in the surface layer of the insulator, and (3) draining charge from the material. In the present study, method (2) has been investigated since it has been reported that carboxyl groups formed by natural oxidation on the polymer surface become trap centres.2"
"Many polymers, especially if linear, are amorphous as judged by macroscopic standards, but are locally rather ordered. They comprise a third class of what are generally termed “amorphous” solids. A comparison of the three classes of amorphous solids is shown in Table 1. If the polymers are highly aromatic in nature they can exhibit unusual electrical properties. They can range from being highly insulating to highly conducting (σ = 10−20 to 10+7 mho/m).1 Their dielectric constants1 can range from 2 up to 300,000."
"Since World War I, electrical insulating oils for transformers and allied electrical equipment have been refined from naphthenic petroleum crude oil stocks. The resulting oils show little or no wax formation and have acceptable dielectric, mechanical and heat transfer properties at temperatures down to −40°C. Usable naphthenic crude oils are coming into short supply and there is a real possibility of a short-fall in supply of the traditional oils in the 1980's. This progress report describes selected portions of work done during the first third of a program directed toward evaluation of potential replacement liquids, particularly other mineral oils."
"Major efforts have been made to study the transport properties of charge carriers in polyethylene (PE). However, the results obtained to date are contradictory and the reported mobility values for electrons in PE range over several orders of magnitude.1–5 Most of these data were obtained from time-of-flight measurements in which a break point in the current — time curve was taken as the transit time td. In all these experiments there was insufficient variation of the applied voltage (V) and the sample thickness (d) to verify the relation for the mobility (μ)."
"Whereas much experimental and theoretical work has been carried out to determine the nature of electrical conduction in the lower members (melting point ≤293°K) of the n-alkane series,1, 2 little work has been reported on higher members such as n-octadecane (C18H38). These higher members of the series are generally solid at room temperature and are amenable to purification by zone-refining. In addition, in the solid state they have well-defined crystal structures.3"
"The incipient physical processes governing nanosecond breakdown in liquids may be conveniently studied with the aid of statistical interpretation.1 Thus, even though the physical processes are not known, it appears to be useful to divide the breakdown lag time into formative and statistical components. The approach has been successfully applied to nanosecond breakdown in gases2 where Townsend α-processes are largely responsible for the formative lag time, while various mechanisms controlling the rate of appearance of electron govern the statistical lag time component. Provided that several experimental criteria are met, the formative time for a particular gas can be assigned a discrete value which depends only upon the applied field and the pressure. The resulting separation of a single-valued formative period and a distributed statistical time lag does not appear tenable in liquid breakdown. Instead, there is evidence3–6 that the formative component of lag time must, itself, be viewed as a distributed quantity. Based upon observation in n-hexane, it has been proposed that the formative time be described by a Gaussian distribution function about its mean value."
"In recent years1–8 considerable attention has been focused on the development of prebreakdown disturbances in liquids. These disturbances (streamers) seem to be the manifestation of a highly conducting state since rapid breakdown occurs when they bridge the gap. From measurements of the effect of small concentrations of specific additives on the velocity of propagation of the streamers we have concluded that electronic processes are of importance in their growth.8 In this paper we shall present further data and shall discuss the mechanisms involved."
"The mechanism of breakdown in dielectric liquids has been ascribed in the past to particles,1 liberated electrons,2 gas evolution,3 and other agencies. There is no doubt that there are circumstances in which any of these may individually assume importance and determine the electric strength of a liquid. Previous work with fluorocarbon liquids'4 has provided an indication that several of these mechanisms may act cumulatively in determining the prebreakdown events in dielectric liquids. The divergent fields used in this study provide a means of artificially retarding the events preceding breakdown and hence allow time resolved Schlieren studies to be carried out to highlight polarity and field effects."
"Although numerous theories have been proposed to explain breakdown in dielectric liquids, a unified understanding of its origin is still lacking. Measurements of such breakdowns are difficult because it is an ultrafast transient event, lasting only nanoseconds. Within that time, quantities of interest such as conduction current can change from milliamperes to tens of thousands of amperes. Moreover, even by taking extreme precautions such as using isolation transformers and well-shielded cables, the electromagnetic radiation associated with breakdown can strongly disturb electronic equipment. Such problems pose great difficulties for investigation of electrical breakdown events based on electrical measurements. In the present study, an optical method based on a laser-schlieren system was used and the spatial development of electrical breakdown in liquid hydrocarbons was recorded photographically."
"Previous work1 by the authors has shown that the breakdown time-lags for oil-filled trigatrons subjected to power frequency voltages can range from a small fraction of a cycle to several cycles of 60 Hz voltage. In general it was shown that long breakdown delays of one quarter to several cycles of power frequency voltage occurred with large amounts of available trigger energy (∼1 J) and low stresses across the main gap (−50 kV/cm rms), while short delays (<1 ms) resulted from the use of higher main-gap stresses and lower available trigger energies (tens of mJ). The present study has sought to examine in greater detail the time-to-breakdown characteristics in the submillisecond delay region and to discuss various breakdown mechanisms in terms of the dependence of the breakdown probability on time."
"In response to projected future needs for the transmission of large blocks of electric power, we have been working on an underground ac superconducting transmission cable system. The program has included the development and testing of an electrical insulation system consisting of epoxy support spacers surrounded by helium pressurized to 450 kPa absolute at temperatures between 4.2°K and 5.0°K. This paper presents the results of recent tests of the electrical breakdown strength of the helium portion of the cable's insulation system."
"The convection of charge in highly insulating liquids, typically hydrocarbon fuels, is of considerable importance because of the associated generation of high intensity electric fields.1 It is generally accepted that a charge is often generated in two-phase liquid transport. It is not so widely recognized that the transport of this charge at interfaces can be strongly influenced by fluid convection induced by the charge itself. Charge transport from liquid to air across an interface is typically via electro-hydrodynamic instability. Previous studies2 have shown that at incipient instability, monolayers of charge should, in fact, behave as though the interface were perfectly conducting. This seeming contradiction of the insulating nature of the liquid results because the incipient instability has zero frequency, and the monolayer simply adjusts to distortions of the interface so as to cancel the electric shear stress and hence to cancel the tangential electric field."
"The electromechanical breakdown mechanism1, 2 has long been presumed to be responsible for the low dielectric strength of elastomers when tested with parallel-plate-type elec­trodes. In this breakdown model, the compression force generated by the applied voltage, V, deforms the polymer slab from the original thickness d0 to a thickness d. This deformation is related to the Young's modulus, Y, of the polymer and the applied voltage by εV2/8πYd2o = (d/do)2 ln(d/do) (in c.g.s. electrostatic units) where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer. For a small value of (V/d0), the value of (d/d0) can be calculated from this equation. On the other hand, since the function on the right hand side, f(d/d0) ≡ (d/d0)2 ln(d/d0) has a maximum value of 0.184 at (d/d0) = 0.6, no stable solutions exist for any applied voltage, V, which gives εV2/8πYd2o greater than 0.184. If the intrinsic strength has not been reached at this value, further increases of V make the deformation unstable, and it has been postulated that the system collapses, i.e., electrical breakdown occurs at an apparent critical stress of However, there are many cases in elastomers where a stable deformation with d/d0 << 0.6 can be maintained with mechanical means. In addition, electrical breakdown always occurs in a very localized area when tested with plane electrodes. With this electrode geometry, the local deformation of the polymers, which has been observed by Fava,3 and by Blok and LeGrand,4 cannot be quantitatively calculated using a simple formula. It appears desirable to examine the electrical breakdown in elastomers using a needle/plane electrode system instead of the parallel plates, with the actual separation between the needle tip and the plane electrode being constantly monitored. This system offers several other advantages over the plane/plane electrode system. First, using a needle automatically reduces the area of high electrical stress in the sample and minimizes the coverage of imperfections which are abundantly introduced during sample preparation. Second, due to the elasticity of the material, any indentation by a very sharp point causes deformation of its surroundings. Thus the needle, which rests at the surface, will follow the indentation during the electromechanical thinning, particularly when the needle is spring-loaded to maintain a good contact with the rubber. The only disadvantage is probably the field enhancement due to the high curvature of the needle tip. This can be corrected by studying the breakdown over a wide range of separations. This method is, therefore, adapted in the following study of the ac dielectric strength of crosslinked EPDM."
"Insulation present as a result of the necessary mechanical construction in power transformers results in interfaces of solid and liquid insulation, both in series and parallel, between current carrying conductors. This complex construction has received little experimental attention1 compared with studies of electrical failure occurring in insulating oils between bare metallic electrodes. The present preliminary work is concerned with the adoption of previously developed optical techniques2 to probe a full scale solid-to-liquid interface modelled on a transformer oil duct."
"There are two techniques commonly used for the measurement of the real and imaginary components of the dielectric permittivity. The most common one is the steady-state, single frequency, measurement. In this method, a sinewave voltage is applied to the measuring cell and the resulting current components are measured. Sensitivity is enhanced by using a tuned amplifier and a phase-sensitive detector (PSD), which compares the phase of the detected current with that of the oscillator. The amplitude of the PSD output is proportional to K' (or K”). Alternatively, the phase and the magnitude of the current required to obtain a null in the detector can be used to measure the current. The most common example of the steady-state circuit is the bridge (Figure 1a).1 Measurements of high precision can be made when the time constant of the PSD is long compared to the period of the drive voltage, but the complexity of the PSD prevents rapid changing of frequency and hinders automation."
"Silver azide (AgN3) is a crystalline solid, and its room temperature conductivity is ∼3 × 10−9 S/cm.1, 2 When a sufficiently strong electric field is applied via electrically conducting contacts, the current through it increases first slowly and then rapidly until disruption takes place,3 the whole process taking several minutes. The disruption is in the form of explosive decomposition into nitrogen gas and silver at one or more sites;4 the explosive decomposition then propagates throughout the crystal at a velocity of ∼1 km/s. We have found that for silver-dag-painted electrodes the critical field is ∼3.5 kV/cm. The time to disruption decreases with increasing field."
"Since soundwaves require a medium in which to propagate, it is obvious that transmission cannot take place in a pure vacuum. It is not so obvious at which air pressure the transmission of ultrasound is still feasible, nor its form of propagation, since theoretically1 transmission is proportional to pressure. In air at atmospheric pressure, ultrasonic waves form and propagate by molecular collisions. As the pressure is reduced, this mode of transmission continues, with a velocity independent of pressure,1 until the mean-free-path between the normal molecular collisions is greater than the ultrasound wavelength, when wave transmission is not possible. However, according to Bolt et al.,2 sound can still propagate by direct flight of molecules from the transmitter to receiver without collision, in what is known as the Geometrical Relaxation Regime."
"This paper reports on a continuing investigation of the partial discharge characteristics of micron-size cavities embedded in a solid dielectric. Partial discharges in large cavities in solid insulation are known to cause progressive deterioration of the insulation and ultimate breakdown.1 A large number of voids in the diameter range one to tens of micrometers are known to be produced in the process of manufacture of extruded cross-linked polyethylene cables.2 It is conceivable that discharges could occur in some of these micro-voids and cause gradual degradation of the plastic similar to discharges in large cavities in solid insulation. In order to study the partial discharge (p.d.) behavior of solid insulators containing micron-size cavities under high-voltage stress, spherical cavities (microspheres) up to tens of micrometers in diameter were introduced into the solid in known proportions. The effect of the size and concentration of the microspheres in the solid were investigated and compared to the p.d. behavior of samples which contain no artificially-introduced microspheres."
"Although it is essential to know the life of insulation at service stress, it is frequently impractical if not impossible to measure this life directly. Hence, service life is commonly inferred from accelerated aging tests in which one or more stresses have higher than normal values. Accelerated tests in which the stress of interest is continuously increased, commonly called progressive stress tests, have received considerable attention recently.1–4"
"The surface conduction of solid dielectrics in atmospheric air has been of much practical concern both in power engineering and electronics since the early days of electrical engineering. It has been known since then that atmospheric humidity reduces both the sparkover voltage and the surface resistivity of most solid dielectrics through the formation of water films. However, most published reports treat the behavior of polluted or completely-wetted surfaces and very few have addressed the behavior of clean surfaces under various conditions of humidity."
"Of the possible synthetic substitutes for cellulose cable insulation previously reviewed by Fujita1 and Reed,2 TenaxR paper3 development was discontinued for economic reasons, while kraft/polypropylene (PP) film laminates have been successfully applied to experimental 132 kV4 and 275 kV5 cables. The se laminates have mechanical properties which permit satisfactory taping; however, the PP film involved tends to partially dissolve or swell in hydrocarbon imprégnants. This compatibility problem was noticed on lapped insulation after being subjected to load cycling.6"
"The radial stress distribution and the maximum stress in a loaded dc cable are governed by the volume resistivity of the insulation. Since the resistivity is dependent on temperature, the maximum stress in the loaded cable is transferred from the hot conductor area to the cooler external portions of the insulation (stress inversion), and, according to load conditions, may be multiplied several times (Figure 1). This results in limitation in either stress or load rating of a dc cable."
"High speed photography has been used for many decades in the study of gas breakdown but only recently has the technology become adequate to permit similar work with solids. Using a simple camera we previously investigated1 the impulse wavefront breakdown of a composite consisting of a column of air in series with a layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The hypothesis in vogue2 is that such insulation breaks down because a discharge in the weaker gaseous section acts like a thin, conducting extension of the metal electrode closing the air column. This extension conveys the applied voltage to the dielectric layer which breaks down if the intrinsic electric strength is reached in the solid at the point of contact with the discharge channel. Our previous investigation demonstrated the inadequacy of this hypothesis. It was shown that the spark was initiated in the solid well before a luminous discharge channel had formed connecting the dielectric surface and the metal electrode. It was proposed that the establishment of a spark depended on the prior establishment of appreciable conductivity in the dielectric. This was attributed1 to the build-up of great stress by charges deposited onto its surface from discharges in the air column, which were shown to occur at intervals on the wavefront as the voltage increased to breakdown. It was of interest to determine whether or not similar conclusions could be drawn about the technically-more-important breakdown by alternating voltage, but the mode of camera shutter operation prevented its application to this problem. The investigation had to wait for the development of the camera described below."
"High voltage transmission technology has now reached a point where presently operating lines carry 765 kV and lines to carry over one million volts are being comtemplated for the near future. To achieve these goals, considerable effort is being expended to develop well-designed insulators suitable for use in these transmission line systems. These insulators must possess the following three properties: i) excellent breakdown characteristics that do not drift as a function of ordinary loading conditions and time, ii) low weight, and iii) high mechanical resistance. Excellent insulating characteristics of certain organic materials coupled with the desired insulating and mechanical characteristics of fiberglas structures have led to the development for use in extra high voltage transmission lines of a composite insulator made of a fiberglas core with sheds of a suitable organic material. It is hoped that these composite insulators will be of economical engineering use.1"
"Von Hippels1 photoconductivity experiments on solid dielectrics and his observations of vacancy and space charge formation ushered in two decades of research on the effects upon breakdown of: electrode mechanisms such as Schottky emission2 and Fowler-Nordheim emission;3 bulk-limiting mechanisms such as space charge limited currents4 and Poole-Frenkel defects;5 models and evidence for current controlled negative resistance;6 and other space charge formation mechanisms.7, 8"
"Epoxy resins have excellent electrical and mechanical properties and they have been used as insulation for switch-gear, instrument transformers, bushings, etc. In these applications, particular attention must be paid to their electrical properties."
"It has been suggested that free radicals may be formed and that they may play a significant role in the electrical treeing process in solid polyethylene (PE).1 The techniques of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) should then be advantageous in a study of electrical treeing mechanisms, since EPR responds only to systems containing unpaired electrons, such as free radicals. The hyper-fine structure of the EPR spectra can provide information about the nature of these radicals. In addition, radicals of differing lifetimes, and their evolution with time may be studied by this technique."
"The subject of this paper is the relationship of the spherulite structure of cross-linked and non cross-linked, low density polyethylene and the channels that are formed in these materials by partial electrical discharges. The spherulite-like structures were produced in cross-linked polyethylene by rupturing below −70°C. The microscopic examinations were made with an optical and a scanning electron microscope."
"The quality of insulation, its durability, and the causes of breakdown can be deduced from the Weibull breakdown distribution. However, the basic phenomena influencing insulation life and the aging process, though investigated for many years, are still not well understood. The life and reliability of cables is influenced by their operation at elevated temperature, by the presence of water and other chemical substances."
"This paper summarizes a study of the effect of cross-linking processes and by-products of cross-linking on electrochemical tree growth in polyethylene insulated cables. The investigations dealt with cables cross-linked by radiation and chemically by peroxides. The test program also included thermoplastic polyethylene insulation containing acetophenone as an additive. Results indicate that the decomposition by-products of peroxides have a major effect on tree growth in cross-linked polyethylene insulated cables."
"In our previous paper,1 we reported on techniques to mea­sure the number and length of water trees occurring from voids in cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE). In this report, a theoretical equation describing the voltage life of XLPE insulation as a function of the deterioration due to water trees is derived. This theoretical equation, without arbitrary constants, closely matches the experimental data of voltage life from 154 kV XLPE insulated cables to 600 V butyl rubber insulated wires."
"The purpose of this work was to develop an accelerated test by which insulating polymers could be screened for their relative resistance to the formation and growth of water, or more generally, electrochemical trees. The requirements placed upon the test were that it be simple and inexpensive, reliable and reproducible, and yield results in a reasonably short length of time. The development of the test necessarily centered around the development of a superior method of growing electrochemical trees."
"In order to better quantize and understand water tree growth in polyethylene under a constant dc voltage stress, we have expanded on earlier work.1 The present study utilizes different polyethylene and a different electrode system. Both of these changes have affected water tree growth."
"Electrical insulators primarily serve to direct current through conductors. They must not only resist electrical stress but also mechanical, chemical, and thermal stresses due to handling, installation, and use under various environmental conditions. Insulators should afford conductors mechanical support, environmental protection against extraneous matter (e.g., dirt, moisture, chemicals) and a means of heat transfer. In general, good electrical insulators are also good thermal insulators. Any degradation of an insulator will reduce its protective function. Specific properties important in electrical insulators may be found in reference 1."
"This paper describes the observed changes in the electrical properties of insulation with time. We might properly exclude reversible changes (e.g., resistance changes from absorption and desorption) as not truly being aging. However, since reversible changes in insulation can result in irreversible changes elsewhere, they are also included. The properties examined are electrical breakdown, insulation resistance, and dielectric loss."
"The mechanical and dielectric properties of solid polymers are usually measured as a function of temperature and frequency or temperature and time; occasionally, the influence of hydrostatic pressure is also considered. It has recently been shown that for mechanical properties, in particular creep, such a characterization is not complete.1, 2 Another parameter which strongly influences the behaviour of polymers is connected with physical aging, a process which occurs because solid polymers generally are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, so that their properties gradually change with the time elapsed after solidification of the melt.3, 4"
"The purpose of this research was to systematically evaluate the utility of thermal analysis techniques in lifetime prediction methods for electrical insulating materials. There have been studies using various separate thermal methods on electrical insulators but there appear to have been no reports where a variety of techniques were applied. Recently the terminology “total thermal analysis” has been applied to such studies.1"
"It is well known that the breakdown voltage in any insulation medium is considerably reduced in the presence of insulating surfaces parallel to the electric field. The mechanism of surface flashover in high vacuum has been investigated by many research workers,1, 8 and it is well known that under the applied voltage the insulator acquires a surface charge.2, 3, 7 The charge is positive if the maximum in secondary electron emission yield (δmax) of the surface is greater than unity and it is negative if δmax is less than unity. For δmax > 1, the electric field at the cathode-insulator junction is enhanced by the positive surface charge and by unavoidable junction imperfections. It is generally believed that the flashover is initiated at the cathode-insulator junction for most insulating materials, since δmax > 1 for such materials. It is also well known that the flashover voltage does not increase linearly with the length of the insulator."
"The purpose of this report is to discuss from the point of view of charge continuity the current-voltage characteristics of a system in which charges are transported both parallel and normal to a surface. Observed characteristics of an interdigital array coated with a thin film of dielectric are compared with numerical experiments designed to model simultaneous bulk and surface currents. The overall objective of the investigation from the materials science viewpoint is to characterize the influence of ambient humidity on charge transport in dielectrics."
"It has been found that air or other gases blowing through a corotron during negative corona charging of an insulating organic polymer film results in a markedly-slower dark discharge rate of the surface charge as compared to the dark discharge rate when the polymer is corona-charged in the ordinary manner in still air. The degree of the effect depends on the gas flow rate and the particular polymer material; for instance, polystyrene copolymers with low glass temperature (Tg) exhibit a strong effect, while high Tg polymers such as poly-N-vinyl carbazole exhibit little effect. The effect has not been observed for positive corona charging."
"Experimental and theoretical investigations of dielectric dispersion and absorption in MIM and MSM thin film structures at low frequencies are interesting both from a theoretical and practical point of view. Because an important part of these dielectric phenomena manifests itself at frequencies below 10 Hz, for which frequency region there is no commercially available equipment for dielectric measurements, there are few laboratories in which such measurements have been performed. Interesting results in this frequency region have been obtained by Simmons and co-workers1–3 and Jonscher and co-workers.4 Fonash and co-workers5 have analysed theoretically the ac properties of biased MIM structures."
"The dielectric behavior of ferroelectric ceramics are of special importance in determining their electro-optic properties. An electro-optic ceramic is a transparent or partially transparent polycrystalline ferroelectric material. It is composed of an aggregate of ferroelectric single crystal grains, with a typical grain size varying from 0.5 to 40 μm depending on the method of fabrication and the temperature of annealing."
"The consideration of steric interactions between molecules in a condensed phase has been considered only slightly in the literature on rotational phases and most of the comments about such interactions are buried in papers primarily devoted to other studies. Ubbelohde1 calculated the volume required for free rotation about the principal axes of several aromatic compounds in the liquid state. This was done in connection with the volume changes on melting of these compounds. He showed that the molecules often have only one axis capable of free rotation, the other axes having a volume of rotation greater than the molecular volume. He did not develop this line of work any further, nor did he provide any indication of his methods of calculating the volume of rotation."
"The bandwidth of ocean cable systems has been increased from 6MHz in the last system (SF) to 30 MHz in the present system (SG). In minimizing the added attenuation and misalignment of SG cable, the outer and inner diameters of the core dielectric have been increased and the dielectric loss of the polyethylene core has been decreased. The nominal losses for SF and SG systems are shown in Figure 1. To obtain the factor of two lower dielectric loss in SG compared to SF, it has been necessary to use a higher density polyethylene, 0.93 (SG) vs. 0.92 (SF) g/cm3. The increased diameter of the SG core, along with the higher density, has led to processing problems. To obtain a cable which was good from a mechanical standpoint, the processing parameters were changed and these affected the transmission characteristics of the finished cable which necessitated the present study.1, 6"
"The dielectric behavior of a mixture of polar molecules provides information about the influence of longrange (dipolar) intermolecular forces on molecular reorientation. If the dielectric dispersions of the components of a binary polar mixture are widely separated in frequency, the observed intermediate value of the permittivity contains information about the dynamics and may be used to evaluate models for the effect of the internal field."
"Following a suggestion by Poley1 that the observed dispersion region of dipolar origin which lies between the Debye dispersion region and optical frequencies might be due to vibration of a molecule about a temporary equilibrium position, Hill2 proposed what is now called an Itinerant Oscillator model. In such a model, it is supposed that a molecule may undergo rotational oscillations about a particular axis, where the instantaneous orientation of this axis is determined by the arrangement of the neighbors of the molecule in question. In addition to the vibrations of the molecule about this axis, the ‘cage’ of neighbors containing the molecule is assumed to undergo rotational Brownian motion."
"The electrical properties of organic solids have been studied in a variety of ways by physicists, chemists, and engineers. The threads of such investigations are, of course, woven into the fabric of the Annual Conferences on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena. The solid organic dielectric systems employed by the pioneering electrical technologists were the natural waxes and that cornerstone of the electrical industry, paper or cellulose. It is not without significance that many of those earlier insulating solids were not only organic but bio-organic and polymeric also. Many enlightened biologists and biochemists are taking note of the fact that bio-polymers are conduction-shy and that this is an important property in regulating life processes. But that is another story, perhaps for a Whitehead lecturer at the end of the century. Today we concentrate on insulating polymers that are man-made. Two factors have caused a flowering of interest in such materials in the last decade or two."

"The behavior of electromagnetic surface waves generated by both elevated and buried sources is explained with physical reasoning and described with mathematical formulas. All combinations of source and receiver orientations are considered. Applications of generalized surface wave formulas for mixed-path and spatially varying terrains are discussed. The generalized surface wave formulas for elevated and buried sources are validated with Sommerfeld integrals and are applicable over a wider range than previous approximate surface wave formulas."
"A variety of continuous wave, swept frequency, and pulse transmission experiments were conducted in and around the Wawona Tunnel at Yosemite National Park. The experiments were performed to obtain data on the HF electrical properties of large volumes of rock. The experiments involved the propagation of electromagnetic waves through more than 300 m (1000 ft) of granite. In situ bulk conductivities of 2–5 × 10−4 mho/m and relative dielectric constants of 5–7 were measured in the 3–50 MHz band. Experimental errors in these values are estimated to be less than ±9% and ±10%, respectively."
"A theoretical model has been developed to explain the unexpectedly long communication ranges of over 300 mobtained, and the marked polarization effects observed, during recent radio transmission measurements in a conductor-free area in a coal mine at frequencies in the range of 57.5 to 920 kHz. The model is based on a dipolar cylindrical TEM mode of propagation, with E vertical and H horizontal, in a low-conductivity horizontal coal seam bounded by high-conductivity rock. The best overall fit to the experimental data over the frequency range 57.5 to 920 kHz is found for coal and rock conductivities of 1.4 × 10−4 mho/mand 1.0 mho/m, respectively, for an assumed coal dielectric constant of 7. A better fit to the data at 57.5 kHz can be obtained if, in the model, the conductivity of the surrounding rock is allowed to be high for only a short distance above and below the coal seam and of a substantially lower value elsewhere. If the coal conductivity is changed from 1.4 × 10−4 mho/m, which is near the lower end of the range of expected values for bituminous coals, to 1.0 × 10−2 mho/m, which is near the upper bound of values for such coals, the attenuation is markedly increased with corresponding reductions in communication range."
"A coal seam is idealized as a resistive slab bounded by more conductive rock. The source is taken to be a vertical electric dipole. It is shown that the dominant mode has relatively low attenuation."
"A telemetry link capable of communicating from a depth of 50 m to the surface is described. The buried package fits within a diameter of 100 mm and provides a bit error rate of less than 10−4 at a rate of 1000 bits per second while consuming 8 w. A control link capable of turning on and off the buried telemetry transmitter from the surface is also described together with results from typical tests in a three-layer soil. The included propagation analysis is intended for use at frequencies below 100 kHz."
"Two borehole instrumentation systems for the measurement of complex propagation constant in the frequency range from 300 kHz to 25 MHz are described. The first system measures the ratio of the signals coupled to two identical receivers in separate boreholes at different ranges from an isolated transmitter in a third borehole. The second system operates in a single borehole by measuring the mutual impedance between two magnetic dipoles aligned parallel to the borehole. This second system has an automatic digital data acquisition system based on a programmable calculator which reduces the data to conductivity and dielectric constant versus frequency. Examples of data on conductivity and permittivity of actual boreholes in various geologic materials are given."
"Experiments were conducted to determine the in situ relative dielectric constant ∊r and skin depth δ of hard rock in a permafrost region. In the Brooks Range in northern Alaska, measurements of transmission attenuation and transmission phase shift were done between the surface and the hole as well as from hole to hole over the frequency range of 5 to 50 MHz. Relative dielectric-constant and skin-depth results were in the ranges 5 to 30 and 20 to 140 m, respectively."
"The basic mechanisms of tunnel propagation and of underground radio systems are briefly reviewed. The TEM approximation of the monofilar mode is compared with available rigorous solutions. Below the tunnel cutoff frequencies, the leaky feeder techniques can be described by the coupled line methods or, with a simpler physical picture, by the use of two eigenmodes. The only valid explanation of the leaky feeder radiation at higher frequencies is the random diffraction of the feeder leakage fields by the wall irregularities. To avoid the inefficiency of this process, the insertion of leaky stubs in a well-shielded coaxial cable is proposed."
"To realize a radio wave communication along mine galleries a few kilometers long without repeater, we show that it is possible to use a leaky braided coaxial cable, with an inductive coupling to the tranceivers. By using the transmission line theory, we determine the optimal electrical and geometrical constants of the cable. A communication 2 km long has been demonstrated for a total transmission loss along the line of about 70 dB. We also account for the possibility in which the cable is situated close to the wall along a short distance and we show that the increase in attenuation of the monofilar mode does not have a great influence on the performance of the cable. The theoretical approach is confirmed by experimental data for a number of specific cases."
"The transmission loss for a leaky coaxial cable communication system in a circular tunnel is calculated for an idealized model. The transmitting and receiving antennas are electric dipoles that may be located anywhere within the tunnel. For typical cable parameters, the optimum frequency is found to be in the range from 2 to 10 MHz. Calculations reveal that the use of a sparse braid and a high velocity cable will strongly improve the cable-dipole coupling with only a small penalty of a higher attenuation rate."
"Over the past several years much effort has been expended in the development of through-the-earth communication links. The development of such links would improve the chances of survival following coal mine disasters by allowing miners to make their circumstances known to rescue teams. In order to implement effective electromagnetic communication links for signalling between mine workings and the surface, the electrical properties of the rock overlying mine workings and ambient background noise levels in several mining provinces are studied. The results of both CW and pulse field transmission tests show good agreement with theoretical considerations, and several techniques for locating either a buried finite line current source or a buried finite vertical-axis loop are demonstrated. The effect of loop size on the latter location criteria is considered, as well as the relative merits of a pulse or CW system."
"Using a finite-difference method, the surface magnetic fields of a harmonic vertical magnetic dipole buried in a laterally inhomogeneous earth are computed. The geoelectric section consists of a homogeneous half space in which a cylindrical conductor of square cross section is embedded. Results are presented in terms of the magnetic field polarization ellipse parameters, with particular attention being paid to the ellipticities in the horizontal and vertical planes. These are shown by means of equicontour maps in the surface plane, and promise to be quite useful in the detection and mapping of subsurface conductivity zones. With reference to buried-source location methods, it is shown that the source location error, as derived from the tilt angle of the vertical polarization ellipse (measured at the surface) is quite small. Finally, some suggestions are made on field procedures, which may enable on-site corrections to apparent locations to be made without knowledge of the subsurface conductivity structure."
"An apparatus designed to measure field patterns of circular-loop antennas immersed in fresh water is described. Measured field patterns are presented to show the differences between bare and insulated loop antennas and to compare loops having different forms of insulation. The insulation is seen to alter the field pattern significantly when the loop dimensions are such that it is electrically large in the water but not in dielectric material forming the insulation. Some shaping of the field pattern can be accomplished by placing the wire loop asymmetrically in the insulation. The measured field patterns are in good agreement with theoretical patterns calculated using the Fourier series analyses for bare and insulated circular-loop antennas."
"To obtain omnidirectional reception, a solenoidal loop antenna can be built into the same cable as that used for the ELF electrode-pair antenna. The loop's noise voltage is higher in level and is more complex than that of the electrode-pair antenna. Measurements of towed cable vibration, of towed antenna noise, and of the physical and electrical properties of antenna cable samples have been made to clarify the noise production process. The results have included (i) the development of a quantitative theory for each significant noise type, (ii) the identification of a number of noise suppression techniques, (iii) the realization of a low noise level, in agreement with theoretical predictions, when an antenna incorporating some of these techniques was tested at sea, and (iv) the construction of various laboratory facilities for testing candidate antenna designs, the most notable being an antenna-towing simulator in the form of a shielded water-flow tunnel."
"The center-driven insulated antenna end-loaded with a bare quarter-wave section is investigated theoretically and experimentally. This antenna is analyzed in terms of the theory of the bare antenna and that of the completely insulated antenna in a relatively dense ambient medium. A simple transmission-line-like solution is obtained. Input admittances computed from the theoretical formula have been shown to agree well with measured results with air-insulated monopoles in both salt and fresh water. For an electrically short antenna the magnitude of the current distributions for a terminated insulated antenna can be kept quite constant, while that of the completely insulated antenna with the same physical length is triangular. This feature of the electrically short antenna provides a more useful current distribution and driving-point impedance. By adjusting the radius of the insulation, it is possible to match the characteristic impedance of the insulated antenna to the apparent input admittance of the monopole antenna to obtain a nearly pure traveling wave even for a longer insulated antenna."
"An airborne short-pulse radar system to measure ice thickness was designed and operated during the 1973–74 and 1974–75 ice seasons. This system supported a joint effort among NASA, the US Coast Guard, and NOAA to develop an all-weather Great Lakes Ice Information System which aids in extending the winter navigation season. This paper describes experimental studies into the accuracy and limitations of this short-pulse radar system. A low-power version of this system was built and operated from an all-terrain vehicle on the Straits of Mackinac during March 1975. The vehicle allowed rapid surveying of large areas and eliminated the ambiguity in location between the radar system and the “ground truth” ice auger team which is unavoidable for the airborne versions of the system. These in situ measurements also permitted an assessment of the effects of snow cover, surface melt water, pressure ridging, and ice type upon the accuracy of the system. Over 25 sites were explored which had ice thicknesses in the range from 29 to 60 cm. The maximum radar overestimate was 9.8%, while the maximum underestimate was 6.6%. The average error of the 25 measurements was 0.1%."
"A VHF impulse radar system operating on the ground is a viable technique for mapping the near-surface geological structure and electrical properties of permafrost. A fixed antenna configuration transported over the surface yields a reconnaissance map of two-way travel times for subsurface reflectors. Wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) sounding determines propagation velocity versus depth when performed in layered areas. To obtain a WARR sounding, one measures travel time versus antenna separation. These techniques were field tested in the Tuktoyaktuk region of the Mackenzie River delta, N.W.T. Data recording was on a graphic display for initial field analysis and on analog magnetic tape for subsequent processing. Reconnaissance surveying has mapped structural features at various depths between 3 and 30 m. The electrical loss of the soils at a site limits the penetration depth. Clays and silts attenuate the radar signal more than sands and gravels. WARR soundings have determined dielectric constant versus depth in layered areas. While impulse radar is useful in delineating geological structure, core drilling is required to determine the geological composition."
"Statistical classification of geoelectromagnetic responses containing additive gaussian noise is considered. The classification is performed with minimum average probability of error criterion of goodness. The Bayes receiver structure for classifying three different but equally likely geoelectromagnetic responses is presented. Since each geophysical model is assumed to have one unknown parameter, the three hypotheses are composite and the received signals are treated as random. The composite hypotheses are developed in terms of frequency-domain model responses. The three conductive models selected for this research are a half space, a sheet, and a two-layer earth. Geoelectromagnetic responses are found to yield strongly correlated signals with correlation coefficients typically of 0.9999. The receiver performance in terms of average probability of error is compared with (1) a system having known and equally correlated signals (ρ = 0.9999), and (2) a system having known orthogonal signals. These comparisons illustrate the degradation of performance resulting from the random and correlated nature of geoelectromagnetic responses."
"The effective conductivity of the geoelectrically complex Wisconsin Test Facility area has been measured by a number of different methods during the past few years. These methods include the H/I induction method, the wave impedance measurement technique (employing lightning discharges as the source), and two direct current methods (the four-terminal-array in-line dipole and Schlumberger techniques). The principal results obtained from these measurements were: (1) The pattern of the EW antenna is skewed clockwise, while the pattern of the NS antenna is skewed counterclockwise. (2) The effective conductivity under the EW antenna is greater than that under the NS antenna. (3) The minimum distance for determining the effective earth conductivity by the H/I method is seven effective earth skin depths. (4) The method of measuring each half-antenna in order to predict the effective conductivity of the whole antenna is correct within a factor of 1.22."
"In this investigation dielectric constant and loss tangent values of coal samples were computed from measurements made at microwave frequencies (8.2–12.4GHz). Two different waveguide methods were used in the measurements. One technique utilized a finite sample and two reactive terminations, and the other required the use of an infinite sample simulated in the laboratory by a very long specimen. For each of the two Pittsburgh seam coal samples, dielectric constant and loss tangent variations were also measured as a function of moisture. Typical moisture contents of 10% and 15% were examined. Electromagnetic propagation through a single layer of coal seam was then investigated analytically as a function of coal depth."

"Remote probing of atmospheric phenomena has become an area of intense research during the past decade. One result of this research is a technique for remote measurement of temperature profiles in the lower troposphere, which was developed and is being tested at Stanford University. This technique is based on the concept of Doppler-tracking an acoustic pulse by an electromagnetic radar; hence the name radio-acoustic sounding system (RASS). With this system, real-time temperature profiles from near ground level to 1 to 3 km have been obtained. These data compare in accuracy with those obtained from radiosondes; however, use of the RASS is a much more cost-effective procedure."
"The results of data obtained at The University of Texas at Austin in conjunction with the ATS-6 millimeter wave experiment are presented. Attenuation measurements at 30 GHz and sky noise data at 20 GHz were obtained for 93 days simultaneously at each of two sites separated by 11 km and for 314 days at one site. The ratio of the loss at 30 GHz to that at 20 GHz due to rain varied from about 2 to about 4 with a median value of 2.65. This value was used to estimate 30 GHz losses for the 38.6% of time during attenuation events for which the satellite link was not available. Space diversity reduced outage time for a system in Austin, Texas, with a 10 db fade margin at 30 GHz from 3.8 hours to 4.1 minutes for the 93 days. Extrapolated to a yearly base this corresponds to 15 hours and to 16 minutes, respectively. A plot of maximum observed cloud height against maximum hourly attenuation indicates that for a given attenuation level a lower limit is set for the maximum cloud height."
"An experiment was performed during the years 1962 through 1964 in which direction of arrival data were collected on pulse signals received over a 450 km east-west path. In order to determine the effect that traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) had on these data, a “corrugation” model was proposed. The corrugation model assumes that TIDs can be treated as if they were moving cylindrical sinusoidal perturbations on the ionospheric reflecting surface. Lateral deviations in the experimental data of the type predicted by this model were found to be quite common. Variations in the detected TIDs as a function of time of year were found to be consistent with the “seasonal effect” studied by Munro in 1958, Jones in 1969, and Davies and Jones in 1971."
"The A1 absorption data for a large number of stations have been utilized to study the global features of the lower ionospheric radio wave absorption. The seasonal index ns (defined in the relation L = Bs (cos χ)ns, where L is the monthly median value of absorption, and χ, the midmonth solar zenith angle), is found to decrease rapidly and smoothly with increasing latitude and also with increasing solar activity for all stations. The constant cos χ plot of seasonal values of absorption versus month shows summer as well as winter enhancements when considered on a global scale. Such plots versus latitude show maximum absorption values at around the tropical region, an increase in the absorption values at high latitudes above 50° N, with a minimum around 40°–50° N, and a fall toward the equator below 23° N during sunspot minimum. A secondary maximum with a strong peak is observed around 50° N with a minimum around 45° N during sunspot maximum. The plots of absorption values as well as temperatures for 30 and 50 km heights versus cos χ show loop-like structuring, indicating a considerable time dependence between them. Absorption and temperature at 30 km show a similar seasonal trend, whereas temperatures at 30 and 50 km show an opposite trend in their seasonal variations. The direction of looping of both temperature and absorption changes near about 35° N between low and high latitudes. Both temperature and absorption show large variabilities during winter periods. These findings have been explained in terms of the seasonal variation of the middle atmospheric wind circulation, and the importance of the dynamics of the lower ionosphere in controlling the aeronomy has been demonstrated."
"A modified form of the Smith-Pitteway full-wave program is used in conjunction with various lower ionospheric profiles to calculate the propagation characteristics of ELF/VLF waves from a source in the magnetosphere, through the ionosphere. Expressions are developed which give the ratio of the power transmitted into the earth's surface to the power incident on the top of the ionosphere, as a function of the number of wave-hops in the earth-ionosphere waveguide. This depends upon the wave polarization after each hop and a limiting polarization is found after several hops. Numerical evaluation of these expressions is presented and discussed."
"A technique is given for determining the thicknesses and the electrical constitutive parameters of a planar-layered medium such as a coal seam in a mine environment. Time-domain experimental data are analyzed with Prony's method to determine the natural frequencies of the layered medium. Explicit relations are given (for dielectric layers) for determining the thicknesses and dielectric constants from the experimentally determined natural frequency results. Explicit expressions are also given (for conductive layers) for calculating the electrical thickness from natural frequency results. The method is illustrated with sample numerical results."
"The components of a transmitted electromagnetic pulse into a conducting dielectric are determined for an arbitrary angle of incidence. Different components of the fields are found to change in distinct ways, and the resulting equations are applied to a double exponential pulse transmitted into the ground."
"Approximate solutions to Tatarskii's equation for the intensity scintillations of a wave propagating through a thin, highly turbulent layer have recently been developed by both the optical and radio astronomy communities. It is demonstrated here that these results, which are at first glance dissimilar, are in fact identical."
"An analysis is given for scattering of a plane wave from a two-layer conducting medium where the upper layer is homogeneous but where the lower layer or substrate is characterized by a periodically varying surface impedance. The exact solution obtained is expressed in terms of continued fraction expansions that converge rapidly for most cases of physical interest. The motivation was to provide understanding of how electromagnetic waves can be used to determine the thickness of a layer of coal that is backed by a relatively highly conducting region of slate. It is shown that, if the slate varies sufficiently slowly in the horizontal direction, the observed surface impedance and wave tilt at the air/coal interface is related directly to the local properties at the point of measurement."
"The presence of a numerical error in a previous publication is noted and the error source identified. However, the theoretical formulation is correct. Corrected numerical results are presented which favorably compare with results computed by other researchers. Also, theoretical results are produced using a predicted ionospheric profile of an upper atmosphere nuclear detonation. Finally, field attenuation for hypothetical two-layer ionospheric profiles is plotted as a function of lower-layer conductivity. It is seen that some hypothetical cases can exhibit high attenuation values in comparison to the normal-day's attenuation value. Some new theoretical expressions for the zonal-harmonics analytical formulation are exhibited, and the improvement expected in computational efficiency and in numerical precision by breakoff of the ground wave from the rest of the summation is discussed."
"Radio-wave scattering from natural surfaces contains a strong quasispecular component that at fixed wavelengths is consistent with specular-point theory, but often has a strong wavelength dependence that is not predicted by physical optics calculations under the usual limitations of specular-point models. Wavelength dependence can be introduced by a physical approximation that preserves the specular-point assumptions with respect to the radii of curvature of a fictitious, effective scattering surface obtained by smoothing the actual surface. Wavelength dependence of the scattering, as expressed in terms of the mean-square tilt of the smoothed surface, then depends on an integral of the two-dimensional surface power spectral density. A uniform low-pass filter model of the scattering process yields explicit results for the effective surface roughness versus wavelength. Interpretation of experimental results from planetary surfaces indicates that the asymptotic surface height spectral densities fall at least as fast as an inverse cube of spatial frequency. Asymptotic spectral densities for Mars and portions of the lunar surface evidently decrease more rapidly, at least as fast as an inverse fourth or fifth law of the spatial frequency."
"Electromagnetic waves from an ELF/VLF source in the magnetosphere may be propagated through the ionosphere to receiving antennas on the earth's surface. Among many factors important in estimating the received signal strength is the geometric spreading factor, dΩ/dAE, measuring the area, dAE, of the earth's surface intercepting the power radiated into the solid angle, dΩ, from the source. The spreading factor has been isolated and accurately estimated by a ray-tracing computer program. Calculations have been performed for transmissions at 3 and 10 kHz and for three different ionospheric models using source altitudes ranging between 300 and 8000 km for some representative receiver point locations. Spreading factors were calculated both for direct and multiple hop waves in the earth-ionosphere waveguide. For low source altitudes (below about 2200 km) the coverage patterns of spreading-factor versus the receiver's geographic position showed well-defined peaks, indicating locally high radio fields. For higher altitudes the coverage patterns were broader but showed weaker maximum field strengths. A comparison was made with a simply estimated factor employed by Smith and Rorden, and quantitative and qualitative differences are noted."
"Characteristics of wavelike perturbations in the F region are deduced from Doppler measurements made on CW transmissions between time station CHU, Ottawa, Canada, and AFCRL, Bedford, Massachusetts. For periods ranging from 5 to 100 min, occurrence frequencies and phase-path amplitudes of F-region perturbations are obtained for the years 1968–1970. While shorter periods are observed to occur more frequently than longer periods, peaks in the distribution are sometimes observed between 10 and 20 min. Amplitude distributions derived from phase-path undulations, which usually reveal an increase of amplitude with period, are at times found to fluctuate, indicating preferred bands of quasiperiodic activity in the F region. For selected ionospheric undulation events, ratios of phase-path amplitude to wavelength are estimated to be usually less than 0.02, but sometimes 0.05. The spectra of time series, derived from ionospheric Doppler measurements, are obtained by means of Fourier-analysis and maximum-entropy methods. These spectra are isometrically displayed using overlapping data windows while advancing in the time domain to observe the dynamics of ionospheric waves. Comparisons are made with comparable data samples derived from random numbers. While both spectral analyses show similar results, the maximum-entropy method appears to make it more certain that temporal changes of the spectra result from actual changes in the periods of wavelike ionospheric perturbations. For estimating the propagation effects resulting from the overhead passage of several traveling waves, mirrorlike reflection surfaces are synthesized computationally through the superposition of cylindrical waves of different characteristics. For a bistatic radar configuration, their effects on changing ray-azimuth deviations and Doppler shifts are illustrated."
"The problem of wave propagation in a medium with random one-dimensional inhomogeneities of dielectric permittivity is considered in the approximation of a Markov random diffusion process. The solution of the diffusion equation for the distribution function of the reflection coefficient from the inhomogeneous slab is obtained. Some statistical moments of the solution are investigated. It is shown that the reflection coefficient has equally probable distribution of phase if the regular reflection at the boundaries of the layer vanishes. For this reason there is no regular component in a random reflected wave. Expressions are obtained for the intensity of the transmitted and reflected waves. A sufficiently thick layer reflects the whole energy of an incident wave in the form of the random scattered field energy. Also found are the formulas for the mean field inside the layer and behind it and for the effective permittivity of a one-dimensional random inhomogeneous medium. The problem is considered for two limiting cases of a small-scale (kl ≪ 1) and a large-scale (kl ≫ 1) inhomogeneous medium."
"A new diagnostic method based on the excitation of thermal resonances using an electroacoustic probe has been developed to determine the electron density profile and other plasma parameters of a cylindrical warm plasma column. A coaxial electroacoustic probe is used to excite and detect the dipole and thermal resonances as the plasma density is varied. The electron density profile is expressed functionally in terms of unknown profile parameters. The profile and other parameters of the plasma column are then determined numerically based on some theoretical formulas and experimental results."
"The propagation of electromagnetic waves excited by electric dipoles oriented along the axis of multilayered spheroidal structures of finite conductivity is investigated. The electromagnetic parameters and the thickness of the layers of the structure are assumed to be functions of the latitude. In the analysis, electric and magnetic field transforms that constitute a discrete and a continuous spectrum of spherical waves are used to provide a suitable basis for the expansion of the electromagnetic fields at any point in the irregular spheroidal structure. For spheroidal structures with good conducting cores, the terms in the solutions associated with the continuous part of the wave spectrum vanish. In general, however, when the skin depth for the core is large compared to its dimensions or when the sources are located in the core of the structure and propagation in the core is of special interest, the contribution from the continuous part of the wave spectrum cannot be neglected. At each interface between the layers of the irregular spheroidal structure, exact boundary conditions are imposed. Since the terms of the field expansions in the irregular structure do not individually satisfy the boundary conditions, Maxwell's equations are reduced to sets of coupled ordinary first-order differential equations for the wave amplitudes. The solutions are shown to satisfy the reciprocity relationships in electromagnetic theory. The analysis may be applied to problems of radio wave propagation in a nonuniform model of the earth-ionosphere waveguide, particularly when focusing effects at the antipodes are important."
"A simple way of calculating the transient response of a thin wire is presented. The method is based on (i) the asymptotic antenna theory for thin wires and (ii) an expansion of the induced current in terms of the so-called natural modes. An explicit series representation of the transient induced current in terms of the resonances of the wire is obtained and this representation is used to numerically evaluate the wire current using a desk calculator. A comparison is made between the results obtained using the asymptotic theory presented here and those obtained from a numerical solution of a space-time integral equation. Good agreement between the results is found except for early times. The method points to a fast way of estimating the transient induced currents on more complicated structures such as a wire model of an aircraft."
"At the XVIIIth General Assembly in Lima, Peru, last August, a decision was made to redirect the emphasis of the Union and to reorganize the Commission structure. This represents the culmination of efforts to correct the organizational problems brought about by the considerable activity within URSI in the field of geophysics. At the XVIIth General Assembly in Warsaw, Poland, in 1972, consideration was given to moving in the direction of a closer association with the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), a part of the International Unon of Geodesy and Geophysics, in the expectation that this would provide a single organizational home for international interests in solar-terrestrial physics. However, this move was resoundingly rejected by the URSI Council; clearly it was desired that URSI retain its separate identity and its emphasis on radio science."
"The synthesis of optimum signals for ionospheric reflection is treated in this paper. It is shown that these optimum signals, when incident on the ionosphere, result in reflected signals which are enhanced in magnitude and compressed in duration. The optimum band-limited signals are found to have relatively complicated frequency and amplitude modulations. The reflection of linearly swept carrier pulses having gaussian envelopes that approximate the optimum signals is also considered, with the result that considerable compression is seen to occur for these signals. The ionosphere is modeled as an inhomogeneous ionized medium with a linear ionization density profile and a constant collision frequency."
"Median height distributions of electron concentration may be determined from ionograms by means of the composite ionogram technique of Wright, or by inserting tabulated parameters in the idealized model of Bradley and Dudeney. This paper discusses the complementary nature of these two approaches."
"The problem considered is an electrically thin dielectric insulating shell on an antenna composed of electrically thin circular cylindrical wires. The solution is a moment method solution and the insulating shell is modeled by equivalent volume polarization currents. These polarization currents are related in a simple manner to the surface charge density on the wire antenna. In this way the insulating shell causes no new unknowns to be introduced, and the size of the impedance matrix is the same as for the uninsulated wires. The insulation is accounted for entirely through a modification of the symmetric impedance matrix. This modification influences the current distribution, impedance, efficiency, field patterns, and scattering properties. The theory will be compared with measurement for dielectric coated antennas in air."
"The paper presents new information on the accuracy of the heuristic approximations in two important theories of multiple scattering in random media of discrete scatterers: Twersky's “free-space” and “two-space scatterer” formalisms. Two complementary approaches, based primarily on a one-dimensional model and the one-dimensional forms of the theories, are used. For scatterer distributions of low average density, the “heuristic” asymptotic forms for the coherent field and the incoherent intensity are compared with asymptotic forms derived from a systematic analysis of the multiple scattering processes. For distributions of higher density, both in the average number of scatterers per wavelength and in the degree of packing of finite-size scatterers, the analysis is carried out “experimentally” by means of a Monte Carlo computer simulation. Approximate series expressions based on the systematic approach are numerically evaluated along with the heuristic expressions. The comparison (for both forward- and back-scattered field moments) is made for the worst-case conditions of strong' multiple scattering for which the theories have not previously been evaluated. Several significant conclusions are drawn which have certain practical implications: (a) in application of the theories to describe some of the scattering phenomena which occur in the troposphere, and (b) in the further evaluation of the theories using experiments on physical models."
"The paper describes a new three-dimensional physical model of a random discrete-scatterer medium and presents the results of an experimental investigation to determine the suitability of the model in studies aimed at the evaluation of approximate scattering theory. In contrast to previous models in which the scatterer statistics were indirectly controlled by a physical process, the present model allows the statistics to be directly controlled as in a Monte Carlo computer simulation. It also permits considerable flexibility in the type of scatterers used. The experimental model investigated consisted of a layered slab region of polystyrene foam (142 × 76 × 27 cm) in which polyethylene spheres of 1.27 cm diameter were embedded at random positions. These positions were generated by computer from a uniform distribution. The medium was scanned by a narrow 35-GHz beam and the randomly varying transmitted field was recorded, sampled, and statistically analyzed. The accuracy of the first and second field moments, determined in experiments on the model with two different average densities of the spherical scatterers, is evaluated."
"The solution for the problem of electromagnetic scattering by a half plane with two different face impedances is presented for both normal and oblique incidence. Illustrative examples are discussed and a chart relative to the existence of surface wave contributions is presented."
"A new method is introduced to analyze phased array antennas of the aperture type, and is based on the Fourier transform relationship between the aperture electric field's cross-correlation function and the angular cross-spectral power density. The theory is first presented in the general form for planar arrays and then is applied to a linear array of infinitely long narrow slots covered by a dielectric slab. The array input admittance as well as the active reflection coefficient are deduced. It is shown that the point of unit reflection coefficient (blindness) in the scanning pattern, which occurs for ideal infinite periodic arrays, no longer exists for arrays with positioning errors. Instead, a near-zero reflection point is preceded and succeeded by two reflection maxima. The cross-correlation method helps also to clarify the nature of blindness for large finite periodic arrays; again, the blindness angle is one at which there is a near-zero reflection coefficient with two high reflection coefficient regions on either side."

"The reflection and transmission properties of electromagnetic waves by a semi-infinite uniaxial plasma moving perpendicular to the plane of incidence are investigated theoretically for the incident H and E plane wave. In this case, the plasma becomes anisotropic, and electromagnetic field components of the transmitted wave should be hybrid modes. Thus it is shown that the behavior of the power reflection coefficient is remarkably different from that of a stationary one."
"Antenna near fields can be accurately computed by the plane wave spectrum (PWS) method. The PWS is directly related to the far field at infinity. That is, at infinity, only a single plane wave contributes to the field. At the close-in distance of just a few wavelengths away from the antenna, integration is performed over all visible wavenumbers and some evanescent wavenumbers. Close (less than a wavelength) to the antenna, integration is performed over all wavenumber space. In between these two extreme distances from the antenna, there is shown to be a finite-sized subregion of all wavenumber space that contains all significant contributions to the field. That is, near fields are shown to be wavenumber-bandwidth-limited. Exploiting this fact, a technique of computing near fields could be created which is faster than both the aperture method and the original PWS method, once a suitable method is developed for determining the wavenumber bandwidth of near fields."
"Scattering of electromagnetic waves by a half-space random medium with three-dimensional correlation functions is studied with the Born approximation. The emissivity is calculated from a simple integral and is illustrated for various cases. The results are valid over a wavelength range smaller or larger than the correlation lengths."
"Brightness temperatures resulting from microwave thermal emission from a half-space random medium are calculated. The random medium has a nonuniform temperature profile and is characterized by correlation functions that possess both vertical and lateral variations. Radiative transfer equations are derived. They are solved with an iterative integral equation approach for small scattering albedo and with a numerical approach for general cases. New results are illustrated, discussed, and compared with various special cases. Phenomena caused by resonant scattering, which is absent under Rayleigh approximations, are revealed. Scattering in the lateral direction contributes to the decrease of the equivalent reflectivity and the increase of the brightness temperature."
"Integro-differential equations are formulated for the general problem of electromagnetic diffraction by an aperture in a planar conducting screen of infinite extent separating two half spaces of different electromagnetic properties. With the aperture specialized to the case of an infinite slot, equations appropriate for TE and for TM illumination are deduced from those for the general aperture. These slot equations are solved numerically, and results are presented for several cases of interest."
"Ray techniques are used to examine the range of validity of the Doppler shift formula Δf = (−fT/c) dP/dt where fτ is the transmitter frequency and P the phase path. The simple formula may be used when the time scale of changes in the medium and transmitter and receiver positions is sufficiently large. However, it may fail for quite moderate rates of change. For a moving transmitter a more accurate analysis shows that there may be additional solutions, associated with the complex and “faster than light” Doppler effects, which it does not predict. Space-time rays are used to obtain formulas valid in the case where the time scale of the changes, though still large in comparison to the reciprocal of the wave frequency, is not large compared with the time characterizing the wave propagation from transmitter to receiver."
"During planetary atmospheric and ionospheric study through radio occultation of spacecraft, multipath propagation often occurs at several altitudes in the medium. Although the signals are then simultaneous in time, they are separate in frequency. It is shown that dispersion can be used to separate such signals because they are inherently single-valued with respect to a family of curves having dT/dF = λD/V2 (where F = frequency, T = time, V = velocity normal to the limb, λ = wavelength, and D = distance from the spacecraft to the limb plane). The concept underlying this corrective measure is much like that of an FM-CW radar wherein frequency separation is converted to time separation. Application of the recommended dispersion may eliminate a major form of multipath and permit signal detection by receivers employing phase-lock loops that depend for their action on the existence of only one frequency. This should facilitate the processing of open-loop recorded data and it might permit the closed-loop reception of multipath signals without loss of information, making possible the observation of radio occultations with signals from Earth to spacecraft. Heretofore, this approach has not shown promise in multipath situations. No specific processes or designs are given here, but there is a practical discussion concerning the degree of accuracy that must be provided in flight and during postflight analysis."
"The effect of ground reflections on Faraday rotation and angle-of-arrival measurements using satellite radio transmissions is considered. It is shown that, in experiments where such techniques are used to monitor small ionospheric perturbations, errors in the measured polarization angle can be significant and may lead to spurious results. Methods of reducing these errors are suggested."
"A five-pulse technique was implemented for the 430 MHz incoherent scatter radar at Arecibo Observatory (18.3°N), to explore the detailed thermal structure of the E region from 105 to 130 km with an altitude resolution of 3 km. Five days of measurements in Sept-Oct 1970 showed long-period temperature fluctuations having a downward phase progression. The temperature oscillations are interpreted as manifestations of a semidiurnal tide which is quite stable over a 12-day period, together with a superimposed spectrum of shorter-period gravity waves which are randomly phased from day to day. The semidiurnal tide increased to a maximum amplitude of 17% of the mean temperature near 115 km and decreased above this altitude as dissipative effects became important. The vertical wavelength, deduced from the altitude variation of semidiurnal tidal phase, showed a smooth increase from about 20 km at an altitude of 109 km to about 50 km at an altitude of 127 km. No ready interpretation of the observed tidal characteristics was possible in terms of present theories for the semidiurnal tide. Altitude profiles of mean daytime temperature and ion-neutral collision frequency were also obtained from the measurements. The mean temperature gradient between 115 and 130 km was 15 K/km, which is somewhat larger than that given by current atmospheric models."
"This paper is designed to provide members of URSI with background information about the International Telecommunication Union and its two international consultative committees (CCIs): the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) and the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT). Toward this end the history of the present ITU and its predecessor organizations, the International Telegraph Union and the Radio Telegraph Union, is reviewed. The history, structure, and schedule of the CCIs are then treated. Finally, it is suggested that, in the future, contacts between URSI and the CCIR will be both richer and of increasing importance."
"The feasibility of carrying out incoherent scatter experiments on the space shuttle has been analyzed. Design criteria considered were the required average transmitter power, frequency resolution, spatial resolution, and statistical accuracy. Experiments analyzed were measurement of the naturally enhanced plasma line and the ion component of the incoherent scatter spectrum, and the plasma line artificially enhanced by an intense HF radio wave. The ion component measurement does not appear feasible, while the other two appear reasonable for short ranges only."
"The measured input impedance of a short, cylindrical dipole immersed in a pulsed, RF discharge, anisotropic, argon plasma is presented. The experimental results show that the input impedance undergoes a pronounced change when the antenna frequency passes through the harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency, which is in agreement with the predictions of kinetic theory. In general, the correlations between experimental and theoretical results are judged as fair to very good over a wide range of plasma parameters. Effects of the plasma sheath are found to be important and a sheath correction term based on a simple sheath model is included for correlating experimental and theoretical results. Using a curve-fitting technique, a sheath thickness of 3λD was determined. Impedance measurements at dipole frequencies above the harmonics showed anomalous results which are explained by kinetic theory."
"The electron plasma waves which are radiated from a point source and propagate in an oblique direction with respect to an applied static magnetic field are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The observed phase velocities and wave amplitudes in the oblique directions are explained by considering anisotropic characteristics of a magnetoplasma in which the directions of phase and group velocities are different. The observed phase velocity in the radial direction was found to agree with the theoretical ray velocity."
"For a specific scanning range of a phased array antenna we define the optimum array as that which has either the minimum maximum reflection coefficient or the minimum mean square reflection coefficient. For every scanning range there are matching angles, one for each criterion, at which the pattern is optimum. This is studied for infinite slot arrays both with and without interelement positioning errors. A two-state matching system is also introduced in which the array is perfectly matched at two angles within the scanning range. The results for the optimization problem for the two-state matching are also given to show how positioning errors and this matching system can result in a large scanning range over which the reflection coefficient is very small."
"The intensity correlation function for an extended incoherent source seen through strong turbulence is worked out assuming that the intensity randomization U ≫ 1. The scintillation index is found as a function of source angular size θ0, path length z, wave number k, strength of turbulence A, and slope of the assumed power law turbulence spectrum α (α = 11/3 for the Kolmogoroff case). The scintillation index drops to about 0.5 when Ak2 zα θ0α−2 ≈ 1."
"Propagation characteristics of pulse waves in rain, fog, and turbulence are determined by a two-frequency mutual coherence function. Parabolic differential equations applicable to strong fluctuation cases are derived for the two-frequency mutual coherence function for randomly distributed scatterers and turbulence. These equations are solved for the plane wave case using the eigenfunction-eigenvalue method. Numerical calculations are given for millimeter waves (100 GHz) and optical waves (0.6943 and 10.6 μm) in rain, fog, and turbulence over the distance of 5 km. The coherence bandwidths are found to be in the range of MHz for millimeter waves (100 GHz) in heavy rain (25 mm/hr) and for optical waves in fog, and considerable distortion of pulse shape may result in these situations. For other cases, the effect on pulse shape distortion may be negligibly small."
"An integral equation is used to study numerically the surface field and radiation from a finite planar structure which has a sinusoidally modulated reactance. The surface reactance is assumed to be uniform near a magnetic line source and modulated sinusoidally in the propagation direction beyond the uniform segment. On the modulated section of the surface, the magnetic field is essentially that for an infinitely long SMRS, provided that most of the energy is radiated through the fast waves before they reach the termination. By taking account of the radiation through the fast waves only, approximate expressions for the radiation pattern are also obtained. The approximated pattern compares well with the radiation pattern found numerically which includes all of the extraneous radiation due to the source, the transition between the uniform and the modulated reactance sections, and the termination insofar as the main beam and the largest sidelobe are concerned. The effects of the parameters such as the modulation amplitude, period, length of modulated section, and the average surface reactance are discussed."

"It is suggested that Breit and Tuve's 1925 application of pulses to ionospheric sounding, which led to the most widely used form of radar, also gave rise to a scientific instrument whose utility, flexibility, and general suitability for intended applications place it on a par with such familiar and standard devices as the telescope or spectrograph. By way of background, there is included a discussion of the circumstances attendant upon the first measurement of ionospheric layer height, which took place in 1912."
"It is demonstrated that the local absorption of an electromagnetic wave incident normally on a plasma can be obtained accurately by the geometrical optics approximation even in a region including the critical density provided that the electron density variation is moderate. The deviation from the WKB result with increasing density gradient is mapped out numerically for a linear profile in both the (isothermal well-ionized) plasma and the (constant collision frequency) ionosphere models; implications for a more general distribution are discussed."
"The problem of the reflection of current at the end of a semi-infinite wire is solved using Wiener-Hopf techniques. It is found that the end effect can be expressed as a single reflection parameter which is a function of the height of the wire, the electrical properties of the earth, and the frequency of the excitation. This simplification yields an accurate representation for the reflected current for points not very close to the end of the wire. Representation of the end effect in this manner leads to a simple theory for long finite horizontal antennas similar to that found in transmission line problems. Input conductance changes as a function of earth parameters for a resonant and an antiresonant antenna are then presented."
"Although the real part of the complex Poynting vector, $\\overrightarrow{P}$, cannot be strictly interpreted to indicate power flow, its previous use for this purpose has produced no logical inconsistencies. Results of Re($\\overrightarrow{P}$) for sources in lossy media, for plane waves interacting with a lossy half-space, and for Hertzian sources located near a lossy ground have been generated. The power flow results for these problems provide unexpected but physically consistent results."
"Using a generalized WKB approach rigorous full wave solutions are derived for the electromagnetic fields for vertically polarized waves propagating through inhomogeneous dielectric media with critical coupling regions. Both the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity profile are assumed to vary in the horizontally stratified media. The generalized WKB solutions are consistent with energy conservation and reciprocity relationships in electromagnetic theory. The reflection and transmission coefficients and the related characteristic surface impedance for inhomogeneous layers of finite thickness are computed as functions of the transverse wave number for several permittivity profiles. Excitation of propagating and evanescent waves are considered. For the trapped waveguide modes of the inhomogeneous layer the reciprocal of the reflection coefficient vanishes and the layer is characterized by a surface impedance. Some special permittivity profiles for which closed form analytic solutions of the electromagnetic fields are known are also considered. Computations derived from these closed form solutions are shown to be in good agreement with computations based on the generalized WKB solutions."
"Propagation along a thin wire located in an air-filled tunnel is considered in the limiting case where the tunnel radius becomes indefinitely large but the distance of the wire to the tunnel wall remains finite. It is found that the results are consistent with the corresponding analysis for a thin wire located over a plane homogeneous earth."
"The complete expressions for the electromagnetic fields generated by buried harmonic dipole sources involve complex integrals that cannot ordinarily be solved in closed form. We present numerical solutions for the quasi-static magnetic fields at the sea surface due to magnetic dipoles submerged from 25 m to 200 m in an infinitely deep sea, for frequencies in the interval 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz. We also present the ratios of the calculated fields to the fields which would be observed if the source were in unbounded free space. It is shown that the presence of the conducting sea water may enhance the field amplitudes in some cases. The results support the commonly proposed “up and over” propagation mechanism for the distant fields from a submerged dipole source."
"A shuttle-pulse technique for simultaneous measurement of the attenuation and bistatic scatter of millimeter waves is described. Measurements were obtained using a propagation path through rain of only a few meters; therefore, the rainfall statistics can be considered constant within the sample volume. Absorption data resulting from this experiment show a disagreement with theory similar to that previously reported. A “total bistatic scatter coefficient” for rain is defined, and the technique of using a shuttle pulse for its measurement is discussed."
"With a view to calculating depolarization and differential attenuation of microwaves by rain, with allowance for the variable shape and orientation of raindrops, the theory of P. C. Waterman is applied to the calculation of cross sections and depolarization ratios of spheroids, and drops of the shapes determined by H. R. Pruppacher and R. L. Pitter. Use of Waterman's extended boundary condition facilitates computation. The scattering characteristics of spheroids appear similar in nature to those of spheres, in the regimes considered. Marked singularities in the characteristics of backscattering depolarization appear at optical size 1.5. The Pruppacher and Pitter drops scatter similarly to equivalent oblate spheroids. Implications for weather radar measurements are briefly discussed."
"A technique to generate global maps of ionospheric parameters on an hourly scale is presented. The technique is based on the updating of predicted monthly median maps of ionospheric parameters with hourly observations. The updating procedure is accomplished by computing the differences between the predicted medians and the hourly values of ionospheric parameters that are observed at specific locations on the globe. These differences are extended to areas where data are not available by employing weighting factors that are derived from correlation coefficients determined from past observations. By applying the present technique to observations of the critical frequency of the F2 region, maps representing the daily-hourly structure of the F2 region can be obtained that have accuracies commensurate with the observations used to update the median maps."
"The Chatanika, Alaska, incoherent scatter radar has been used to measure the spatial variation of auroral ionization. A two-dimensional (altitude, latitude) cross-sectional map of electron densities in the ionosphere is produced by scanning in the geomagnetic meridian plane. The altitude variation of ionization is used to infer the differential energy distribution of the incident auroral electrons. The latitudinal variation of this energy distribution and the total energy input are obtained by use of the meridian-scanning technique. Examples are shown of observations made during an active aurora."
"The interaction of an electromagnetic wave with the shock-induced plasma flow field generated around a blunt body capsule as it encounters the planetary atmosphere of Mars is examined. From two preliminary engineering models of the Martian atmosphere and the estimated entry-trajectory characteristics of the capsule, it appears that the communication links to and from the capsule may be blacked out during entry because of a high free-electron concentration in the wake region of the capsule. In the worst case of a frozen flow field behind a normal bow shock in local thermodynamic equilibrium, estimates of the free-electron concentration in the wake region indicate peak values between 7.9 × 1010 e−/cc and 7.7 x 1011 e−/cc. Both of these values are above the critical electron concentration of 6.53 × 1010 e−/cc for the S-band direct transmission link to Earth, and 1.80 × 109 e−/cc for the indirect UHF transmission link through a relay bus. Also, atmospheric reflection and refraction of the telemetry signals are considered near blackout. The reflection and refraction coefficients are shown to satisfy Riccati equations, which are solved numerically to yield the desired coefficients. Estimates of the reflection and refraction coefficients for several possible electron concentration and collision frequency combinations are cited for linear and exponential plasma wake distributions."
"Formulas convenient for the optimization of various performance indices are discussed. Typical indices that have been optimized, both with and without constraints, are directivity, power gain, quality factor, and main beam radiation efficiency."
"Starting from a description of mode propagation in a homogeneous medium, coupling between different modes at an interface is derived based on a general formulation of the boundary conditions for a medium without spatial dispersion. The results are then applied to a layered medium which yields a simple way to derive the first-order coupled differential equations for a multi-mode, inhomogeneous medium in the case of vertical incidence. By this method the results are easily interpreted. As an application the magnetoionic medium is studied."
"An exact solution of Maxwell's equations is presented which describes adequately for the first time the many observed characteristics of the lightning discharge. These include: the source of the field required to develop the discharge channel; the leader stepping with pause time between steps which continue along different directions; the large diameter halo appearance of the leader and the small diameter hot arc return stroke; the current rise time in the channel. The solution provides the electromagnetic properties (inductance, capacitance, impedance) required to describe in detail the characteristics of the radio emissions: the spatial distribution of the radio field including its relative intensity and polarization; time duration of the radio signal with aspect angle; the energy radiated by the process. The solution provides a basis for designing meaningful experiments to establish relationships between observables essential in isolating the important characteristics required for a more complete description of the nature of lightning."
"The electric fields produced by lightning return strokes near Kennedy Space Center, Florida, have been measured simultaneously at distances of about 5 to 25 km and about 200 km. Detailed records of the first 12 μs of waveforms from four strokes are presented, as well as data on the initial field risetimes for 58 first and 92 subsequent strokes. The mean field risetime measured between the 10 to 90% points was about 1 μs at the close station and about 2 μs at the distant one."
"Because of the low transmitted power levels that are feasible in the extremely low frequency (ELF) band, it is essential to exploit such noise excision methods as are available to maximize communications signal-to-noise ratio (snr). A method that employs wideband clipping on ELF noise to match it to a linear matched filter has been evaluated with the use of noise data from northern latitude receiving sites. The analysis of month-long samples of noise data from all seasons and nearly all times of day indicates that an improvement in snr of at least 10 dB can be realized nearly all the time with the use of one or two parallel, manually adjusted clippers whose clipping levels are set on the basis of seasonal mean noise level."
"This paper presents the results of rain attenuation and depolarization measurements made at 17.65 GHz along a 1430-m terrestrial path. The experimental observations agree well with theory."
"The FM-CW technique is used to perform a partial reflection experiment. This method seems to be the only possibility to overcome the enormous noise level in the frequency range 2–6 MHz in middle Europe. A frequency near 4 MHz is swept by 100 kHz in 1 second and a transmitter power of 50 W is used. The technique, the operation and the data reduction are described. The possibility of measuring the electron density and the collision frequency profiles simultaneously is discussed. Some examples of deduced collision frequency profiles and electron density distributions under normal and anomalous conditions are presented."
"A technique has been developed for generating “shadow maps” (the shadow that an array of showers would cast on the earth's surface) in the microwave radiation from a hypothetical source in a geostationary satellite at specified azimuth and altitude. The input data for this technique are weather-radar records on digital magnetic tape. To describe and demonstrate the technique and its intended use, this paper contains just one shadow map at high resolution (approaching that of the radar record), one sequence of maps at a lower resolution covering the three hours of one storm-array passage, and an analysis of the effect that one passage would have had on an earth station and on various path-diversity pairs. We hope to generate high-resolution maps for a whole season (summer 1976) and to use them to catalogue and compare the various storm-array passages that would have a significant effect on slant-path microwave links."
"Analysis of simultaneously recorded 1.5- and 4-GHz scintillations at Tangua, Brazil, has shown that the scintillation index varies approximately as the wavelength between 1.5 and 4 GHz under weak scattering conditions. The amplitude distributions, especially those of the 1.5-GHz data, are somewhat irregular in shape and cannot be represented by a simple mathematical expression. The power spectra of the amplitude fluctuations on a log-log plot show a slope of -3 and have low wave number rolloffs near 10−2 m−1. This paper discusses some possible implications of these findings. Half of the 4-GHz power spectra show the minima which are predicted by the thin-screen weak scattering theory. The 1/e falloff of the autocorrelation corresponds to irregularities between 100 and 200 m. The cross correlation between the 1.5- and 4-GHz scintillations is about 0.3."
"Numerous formulas have been developed to partially correct laser ranging data for the effects of atmospheric refraction. These formulas all assume the atmospheric refractivity profile is spherically symmetric. The effects of horizontal refractivity gradients are investigated by ray tracing through spherically symmetric and three-dimensional refractivity profiles. The profiles are constructed from radiosonde data. The results indicate that the horizontal gradients introduce an rms error of approximately 3 cm when the satellite is near 10° elevation. The error decreases to a few millimeters near zenith."
"The radiation pattern of electric dipole and magnetic loop antennas is determined experimentally in the parameter regime 0.1 $\\lesssim$ ω/ωc $\\lesssim$ 1, 1 $\\lesssim$ ωp/ωc $\\lesssim$ 30 (ωp, ωc = electron plasma, cyclotron frequency, respectively). The measurements are performed in a uniform, dense magneto-plasma (density 1010 < ne < 1012 cm−3, temperature 0.2 < kTe < 3 eV, magnetic field B0 $\\lesssim$ 100 G) of very large dimensions (50 cm diameter, 300 cm length) where boundary effects are negligible even for many far-field patterns. When the antenna dimensions are small compared to the parallel whistler wavelength (k|| Lant ≪ 1) the radiation pattern is characterized by resonance cones. For finite sized antennas (k|| Lant $\\gtrssim$ π) no cones are observed, but a dipole-like pattern with a field-aligned narrow lobe. Amplitude and phase distribution in the near zone and far zone are investigated. The antenna orientation with respect to the static magnetic field is varied. At large amplitudes (Brf/B0 $\\simeq$ 1%) the radiation pressure modifies the plasma density and the wave self-focuses. In this regime nondiverging filaments of radiation are seen."
"An ionospheric volume in the F layer subjected to high power high frequency illumination is observed to be an effective scattering medium for radio signals. Experimental results are representative of a field-aligned scattering geometry. Scatter of the incident wave into electrostatic waves by these strongly field-aligned density irregularities is considered. This model explains the large decreases in radio wave reflectivity seen during the ionospheric modification."
"The electric and magnetic fields from a circular loop antenna are decomposed into various field modes which depend only on the coordinate system being used. These modes can be calculated in advance even if the source and loading function of the antenna are unknown. The excitation factor for each mode, which is related to the current distribution on the antenna, is the only variable that must be determined from time to time as the loading impedance and the source function of the antenna are changed. It is found that the mode-expansion technique is quite convenient for field computation at many locations where only a few modes will be sufficient to represent the field distribution."
"The analysis of the insulated dipole in a relatively dense medium is extended to coupled, individually insulated elements arranged in a circular array. It is shown that the transmission-line-like distributions of current are preserved for each phase sequence but with different complex wave numbers that depend not only on the electrical properties of the insulating and ambient media but also on the coupling among the elements. Special attention is given the two-element and three-element arrays."
"Reflector antennas have been used since the radio pioneering era of Lodge, Hertz, and Marconi, but it took the exigent demands of radar in World War II to stimulate a real development in the reflector art. Subsequent interest in the science of radio astronomy and the inception of microwave ground communication links were responsible for a burgeoning growth in the field, so that in the 1940s and 1950s the design principles and requirements for prime focus fed systems were well established. Cassegrain, or secondary focus systems, and horn reflectors came into prominence in the early 1960s with the advent of satellite tracking and communication networks. The desire to maximize the gain, or the gain-temperature ratio, then led to development of sophisticated techniques for properly shaping the illumination over the reflector aperture in order to maximize efficiency and minimize spillover, among them being the shaping of the sub-reflector in Cassegrain systems and the use of multimode and hybrid mode feed horns. Not all reflector antennas utilize paraboloidal surfaces. Some recent developments in line source feeds make the spherical reflector attractive for scanning applications and the conical reflector for deployable, space-borne antennas. The large 1000-foot diameter reflector at Arecibo is a well known example of the former. Although some extremely large spaceborne reflector antennas have been proposed and studied, the largest now in use appears to be the unfurlable 30-foot reflector carried by ATS-6. Finally, some gain comparisons are given for a few of the (electrically) largest reflectors that have been built both for radio astronomy and for space communications. If some milestones in reflector development have been overlooked it is due to the limitations inherent in a review paper."
"Valenzuela [1968] has presented expressions for the scattered fields to second order from tilted slightly rough perfectly conducting and dielectric surfaces. The first-order coefficients of the Fourier expansion of the scattered fields from a perfectly conducting surface are correct; however, the second-order coefficients for the same case lack additional terms."
"The theoretical determination of the distributions of surface densities of current and charge induced on an electrically thick, infinitely thin-walled, perfectly conducting, tubular cylinder by an incident, E-polarized plane electromagnetic wave is reviewed. The theory is applied to a cylinder with ka = 1 and kh = 3π/2 where a is the radius, h the half-length, and k the wavenumber. Extensive graphs of the axial and transverse distributions of the surface density of current and of the surface density of charge are presented. An analytical representation of these in terms of forced and resonant transverse Fourier components is described and used to interpret the properties displayed in the graphs."
"The measurement of the surface densities of current and charge in both amplitude and phase over the entire surface of an electrically thick conducting tube (ka = 1) when illuminated by an E-polarized incident field is described. Use is made of a probe system consisting of a short monopole and two small mutually perpendicular shielded loops arranged to move axially as a unit along a groove in a thick-walled aluminum tube which can be rotated through 360°. Graphs of the measured magnitude and phase of the axial and transverse components of the surface density of current and of the surface density of charge on the outside surface of the tube are displayed as functions of the axial and transverse variables. Problems of measurement and of the correlation of measured and theoretical values are discussed. It is concluded that with proper attention to detail accurate measurements can be made and the distributions of current and charge understood."
"The problem of one or more infinite transverse slots in a parallel plate waveguide wall is considered. An integral equation is derived for the aperture electric field for the TMz case. The integral equation is solved by the method of moments. Steady state results are presented for the case where the exciting field is a TEM mode in the waveguide. Both transient and steady state results are presented for the case where the exciting field is a plane wave incident from outside the guide."
"A doubly infinite set of linear equations is derived for the currents excited on a rectangular wire mesh that is located over a conducting half space. The mesh consists of two parallel grids whose wires are perpendicular to each other. In the formulation, the spacing between the grids is arbitrary but the numerical method, involving direct matrix inversion of the truncated set, is only feasible if the intergrid spacing is nonzero. The numerical results show that the reflection properties of the grid are a strong function of the azimuthal direction of incidence. This characteristic is consistent with earlier results for unbonded meshes in free space. An important conclusion is that wire mesh ground systems used, for example, in high frequency antenna installations should employ unbonded (i.e., unsoldered) wire junctions."
"Averages and distributions of the rain parameters, cancellation and degree of orientation, are presented. The quantities were determined from observations of power and correlation with a polarization diversity radar using circular polarization at 16.5 GHz during the period 1971–1974. Data are given for a related quantity, “maximum cancellation.” The fact that this quantity is not invariant with range is shown to be evidence for the occurrence of incoherent transmission processes at 16.5 GHz."
"Observations of depolarization caused by rain at 16.5 GHz taken over a short link during parts of four seasons, 1972–1975, at Ottawa, Canada, are presented. They include determinations of the mean canting angle and the real and imaginary parts of the differential propagation constant."

"An expansion of the nonsingular solutions of the vector wave equation in cylindrical coordinates in terms of the nonsingular solutions of the vector wave equation in spherical coordinates is presented. As an example application of the expansion, the scattering of a particularly simple gaussian beam of electromagnetic radiation by a spherical obstacle is discussed. Both perfectly conducting and dielectric spheres are treated."
"The integral expression for the Nth-order moment of irradiance fluctuations of a finite beam wave traversing a weakly turbulent atmosphere is derived by the parabolic-equation method. The expression for the Nth-order moment, evaluated for the weak scintillation limit, is the same form as the Nth-order moment of the log-normal distribution. This expression provides a necessary condition for the log normality of the irradiance fluctuation of beam wave. For the plane- and spherical-wave limits, the result is valid at all distances $\\bar\\rho$ from the axis of the beam less than the propagation distances z and the distribution function depends upon $\\bar\\rho$. The values of the variance coincide with the results of the usual first-order perturbation theory, and log-normality also holds."
"Pulse propagation in a random medium is determined by the two-frequency mutual coherence function which satisfies a parabolic equation. In the past, approximate or numerical solutions of this equation have been reported. This paper presents an exact analytical solution for a plane wave case when the random medium is approximated by A(0) - A(ρ) $\\propto$ ρ2. Analytic expressions for two-frequency mutual coherence function, pulse shape, temporal and angular spectra are presented in universal forms, and should be applicable to a large number of practical problems."
"The bicoaxial leaky line comprises two separate leaky cables spaced closely parallel so that the two outer braids or conductors form a bifilar transmission line. The type of construction was developed first as a research tool in the study of mode-conversion processes in leaky coaxial cables and to test previously developed theories; the single-wire modes of the two constituent cables combine to form a bifilar mode which can be more accurately predicted and measured. As well as serving this purpose, the new cable lends itself to a new configuration of leaky cable radio communication system in which line repeaters are bridged between the constituent coaxial cables in alternate directions instead of being connected simply in series; midspan filters ensure system stability. Such a system provides duplex communication from a unified base station using simple one-way repeaters and is particularly adaptable to spurs and branching. The inherent “tailback” feature also provides a particularly consistent level of coupled signal through the system. The overall system of bicoaxial cable and line repeaters will accommodate several separate radio channels simultaneously and thus constitutes a bidirectional “communications highway” for mining use."
"Crustal structure in orogenic regions such as the Himalayan one consists of a tilted sedimentary layer on a granitic basement which is covered by metamorphic rocks. The complex crustal problem is modeled by an almost representative three-layer model of an anisotropic dipping layer with a substratum of a transition layer overlaying a homogeneous half space. The surface impedance of natural electromagnetic fields has been evaluated for varying anisotropy and inclinations of the sedimentary surface and thickness of the metamorphic rock regions. The following interesting conclusions can be drawn from the curves. (i) Generally, crustal electrical mappings are limited in depth by increasing anisotropy of horizontal sedimentary layers (higher longitudinal conductivity as compared to the transverse one). Fortunately, here the plane wave impedance has a better response for higher dip angles and increasing anisotropy coefficients. (ii) The thickness of inhomogeneous metamorphic regions modifies the phase of the impedance parameter quite characteristically, particularly for high anisotropy factors. The study of deeper processes in areas of intense deformation and movements may find ready application of the numerical results of the realistic model, showing promise for deeper diagnostic probing by natural electromagnetic fields."
"It is shown that an FM-CW radar can be used as a Doppler radar to measure winds. A description of the processing used to measure Doppler shifts is included. An analysis of scattering by refractive-index fluctuations shows that, under certain conditions, a Doppler FM-CW radar should be able to measure winds continuously in the boundary layer. Experimental results comparing horizontal winds measured by a tethered balloon and the FM-CW radar show very good agreement."
"To analyze ELF wave propagation in the earth-ionosphere cavity, a flat earth approximation may be derived from the exact equations, which are applicable to the spherical cavity, by introducing a second-order or Debye approximation for the spherical Hankel functions. In the frequency range 3 to 30 Hz, however, the assumed conditions for the Debye approximation are not satisfied. For this reason an exact evaluation of the spherical Hankel functions is used to study the effects of the flat earth approximation on various propagation and resonance parameters. By comparing the resonance equation for a spherical cavity with its flat earth counterpart and by assuming that the surface impedance Z1 at the upper cavity boundary is known, the relation between the eigenvalue v and Sv, the sine of the complex angle of incidence at the lower ionosphere boundary, is established as v(v + 1) = (kaSv)2. It is also shown that the approximation v(v + 1) $\\cong$ (v + 1/2)2 which was used by some authors is not adequate below 30 Hz. Numerical results for both spherical and planar stratification show that (1) planar stratification is adequate for the computation of the lowest three ELF resonance frequencies to within 0.1 Hz; (2) planar stratification will lead to errors in cavity Q and wave attenuation which increase with frequency; (3) computation of resonance frequencies to within 0.1 Hz requires the extension of the lower boundary of the ionosphere to a height where the ratio of conduction current to displacement current, (σ/ω∊0), is less than 0.3; (4) atmospheric conductivity should be considered down to ground level in computing cavity Q and wave attenuation."
"It is argued that the conventional interpretation of the correlation ellipse in ionospheric drift analysis is correct, and that this ellipse provides a useful description of the spatial properties of the amplitude pattern over the ground."
"In-situ measurements of F-region irregularity amplitude and ambient electron density made by the retarding potential analyzer on OGO-6 near the perigee altitude of 400 km have been utilized to derive the variation of electron density deviation over the equatorial region. Based on these measured electron density deviations and other assumed model parameters including a three-dimensional power law form of irregularity spectrum with index 4, a model of equatorial scintillations is developed in the framework of diffraction theory. The percentage occurrence contours of estimated equatorial scintillations ≥ 4.5 dB at 140 MHz during 1900–2300 LMT for the period November–December 1969 and 1970 have been derived. The model is found to depict a pronounced longitude variation with the scintillation belt width and percentage occurrence being maximum over the African sector. The latitude extent of the spatial scintillation belt narrows over the American sector without much decrease in the scintillation occurrence whereas over the Indian and Far Eastern sectors both the extent and the occurrence are found to decrease. The percentage occurrence of scintillations estimated from this model is found to be consistent with VHF scintillation measurements at Ghana, Huancayo, and Calcutta. In addition, the model was found to be in qualitative agreement with GHz observations at various longitudes made by the COMSAT group. The effects of varying model parameters on scintillation estimates at VHF, UHF, and GHz are discussed. Implications of the observed longitudinal variation of scintillations on current theories of equatorial irregularity formation are indicated."
"Digital power spectral analysis and coherency analysis are powerful techniques for studying ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves in the earth's magnetosphere. Wave polarization parameters provided by these techniques are important in the development of theoretical models for wave generation. Because of this, it is important to understand the capabilities of the digital analysis techniques. Three different techniques of using the spectral matrix to do wave analysis have been presented in the literature. Because data for wave studies involve measurement in arbitrary coordinate systems, it is necessary to transform the spectral matrix to the principal plane of the wave before coherency analysis can be performed. The fundamental differences in the three techniques lie in how they determine the transformation to the principal plane. A comparative study of these three techniques was done using simulated data involving known wave and noise properties and real ULF wave event data from the geosynchronous satellites ATS 1 and ATS 6. In general, the quality of performance of the three different techniques on both simulated and real wave events was approximately the same."
"A very-long-baseline interferometer system was designed and built for geodetic applications. Each interferometer terminal records a 360-kHz spectral band of noise from a compact extragalactic radio source. The center frequency of the spectral band can be selected to sample sequentially bands covering a much wider frequency range to obtain subnanosecond accuracy in group-delay measurements. A tunnel-diode pulse generator is used to calibrate the delays in the receiver. The necessary sets of algorithms and computer programs have been developed to analyze the data and have allowed the system to be employed to make accurate determinations of vector baselines, radio-source positions, polar motion, and universal time."
"A theory is presented for the input impedance of a short, cylindrical dipole antenna immersed in a warm anisotropic plasma which is described by the kinetic theory (Boltzmann equation). The plasma is assumed to be homogeneous with collisions included. The input impedance is based on the induced EMF technique and a quasistatic approximation. The dipole is assumed to have a triangular current distribution along its axis. For a dipole oriented parallel to the static magnetic field, the input impedance is derived as a one-dimensional integral suitable for numerical integration. Under certain conditions, this integral can be evaluated giving analytical formulas valid near the second and third electron cyclotron harmonics. The results show new contributions to the input impedance due to the excitation of cyclotron harmonic waves which propagate near the harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency. These harmonic effects are not predicted by either the cold or hydrodynamic theories."
"It is shown how the effect of the mounting surface for a flush-mounted aperture antenna can be considered as a modification of the Huygens' obliquity factor, which represents the pattern of the radiation of an element of the aperture. The same method, in conjunction with Babinet's principle, applied to a small slit, gives the corresponding element pattern for an elementary dipole and lends credence to the method even when applied to very small apertures. An application is made to a solid-state laser configuration, and a result obtained by a more involved method is shown to correspond to the obliquity factor for an air-dielectric interface. A correction to the formula is also found, and an (apparently new) expression is found for the obliquity factor when there is a change of medium at the aperture."
"A general scheme for calculating the change (both the real part and the imaginary part) of the propagation constant of a surface-wave mode on a general open waveguide structure is presented. By carefully keeping track of lower-order terms in the analysis, it is shown how approximations commonly made in other analyses can result in quite significant errors in the determination of the radiation loss. The resulting formulas require knowledge only of the fields and propagation constant of the corresponding straight waveguide mode, and the value of the radius of curvature of the waveguide axis. As a simple example, the curvature loss of a Goubau line is calculated."
"The problem of ionospheric scintillations is considered. It is shown that the result obtained using an ionospheric turbulence model with a single-scale length parameter, predicting modulation indices much larger than unity, is not valid for a two-parameter model of the Kolmogoroff type unless the rms phase variation for the wave exiting the ionosphere is larger than the ratio of the outer scale to the inner scale of turbulence."
"The effect of lateral inhomogeneities on electromagnetic remote probing of layered structures is considered. The excitation is taken to be an incident transverse electric (TE) plane wave. The fields, the surface admittance, and the wave tilt depend upon the angle of incidence, the distance from the air-coal interface, the electrical contrast, and the layer profile (e.g., sinusoidal, step, and slant profiles). Both low-and high-frequency cases are illustrated and compared with corresponding results having no lateral inhomogeneities. Results indicate that the surface admittance and the fields tangential to the surface are “good” indicators of the local structure, whereas the field normal to the surface and the wave tilt are not. However, the wave tilt and the field normal to the surface give good indication of subsurface anomalies. As the observation point is moved away from the air-coal interface, the “information content” regarding the lateral inhomogeneities rapidly decreases. Thus, measurements performed on the surface, or measurements dependent upon the fields at the surface, e.g., reflection coefficients, are more sensitive to lateral inhomogeneities than measurements performed away from the surface."
"The field scattered by a homogeneous isotropic dielectric of finite extent illuminated by a low-frequency plane electromagnetic wave is expressed in terms of a single polarizability tensor which is a function of only the geometry of the body and a parameter τ representing either the relative permittivity or permeability of the dielectric. Integral equations from which to compute the individual tensor elements are derived. Some of the properties of the tensor, including bounds on its diagonal elements, are also developed, and data are presented for the special case of a spheroidal body."
"The structure of the sheath surrounding a cylindrical or spherical body immersed in an isotropic collisionless plasma is investigated for a wide range of parameters corresponding to regions in space where the electron photoemission by the surface can produce small, strong, or even dominant effects (in this last case, the photoemission is also assumed to have cylindrical or spherical symmetry). The collected currents are also considered."
"The XVIIIth General Assembly of URSI was held in Lima, Peru, 8–19 August 1975. Four symposia were held in conjunction with the Assembly: (a) radio waves and ionosphere, (b) nonstationary signal analysis, (c) telecommunications noise and interference environment, and (d) the teaching of electromagnetics and telecommunications science. The organization of these symposia contributed a great deal to the success of the Assembly. The chairmen of the US Commissions were asked to submit brief reports on the scientific highlights in the sessions of interest to their commissions, or to designate others to do so on their behalf. This document is a compilation of those responses, made up of summaries provided by George Birnbaum, Commission I; Alfred H. LaGrone, Commission II; J. M. Kelso, Commission III; D. L. Carpenter, R. W. Fredricks, and C. Russell, Commission IV; Alan Barrett, Commission V; A. A. Ksienski, Commission VI; R. J. Collins, Commission VII; and George Hagn, Commission VIII."

       "H. Rubens' spectroscopic work began in the near infrared and progressed in steps to the far infrared. The milestones along the way from 1892 to 1922 are in both the development of experimental techniques and equipment, and in the wide range of problems that were attacked with this equipment."
"The Grating Era is rather an ill-defined period, since Rubens used them almost from the time of his first measurements in the far infrared, and they are still being used today in many commercial instruments. Thus, I will discuss principally the post-Rubens time, up to the advent of the modern interferometer and the laser. In actual time, that is from 1920 to 1960."
"This paper is concerned with the history, the development and the important aspects of that part of interferometry which is known today as Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS). An excellent review of the same topic with the development up to 1965 has been published by Loewenstein [6]. The modern birthday of FTS was 1951 when Fellgett [16] showed in his thesis the multiplex advantage of two-beam interferometry over the sequential slit spectrometry. Already a few years earlier, it was shown by Jacqinot and Dufour [15] that axially symmetric interferometers have a throughput advantage of light-gathering over slit-instruments. It is fair to mention the work of Rubens and Wood [2] who already in 1913 first used the FTS in the far-IR but gave it up some years later because of the lack of digital computers. The years from 1952 to 1961 could be called the “exploration period of FTS”. First interferometers of the lamellar and Michelson type were developed for the IR and mainly FIR. The great potential of digital computers for the multiplex FTS was appreciated while it was realized that analog computation is too troublesome to be competitive. The subjects of resolution, apodization and scanning function, interferogram sampling, filtering and digital recovering of the spectrum were worked out in this period. At the end of 1961 the thesis of J. Connes [4] appeared which covered almost all basic aspects of FTS including phase error problems and noise theory. After 1961 the “elaboration period of FTS” started and is apparently continuing at present. It is astonishing how many new significant improvements could still be found. Among these are the dispersive or amplitude-phase FTS, double-beaming in the conventional (chopping) way or in the more sophisticated compensative (interferometric) way, furthermore the phase-modulated FTS, the polarizing interferometer and the development of high-resolution FIR-FTS. Since it seems impossible to mention in detail all the contributions to FIR-FTS in this paper, an extensive list of references is added."
"The coherent radiation history of the far IR began around 1960-62 with the extension of the Compagnie Genérale de Telégraphie sans Fils 0 type Carcinotrons down to 500 μm wavelength and the extension of the He-Ne laser by Bell Telephone Laboratories first to 28 and later to 133 μm wavelength [1,2]. Less than a year later, the British Services Electronics Research Laboratory announced the first far IR molecular lasers (H2O and HCN) operating at 78 and 337 μm wavelength [3]."
"Several important theoretical papers were published in 1960 or so stressing the advantages, in detector-limited circumstances, of two-beam interferometry as a method of spectroscopy. There followed several years of imaginative development of suitable laboratory systems for the submillimetre spectrum. Gradually the pitfalls of the method were identified and the many sceptics were slowly won over as greater reproducibility was achieved. In terms of signal-to-noise ratio, rate of data acquisition and spectral resolution, the theoretical analysis promises yet more remarkable performance than has yet been widely achieved, however. The time is opportune for detailed assessment of the current limitations to performance in practice. In terms of the possible modes of application (e.g., absolute radiometry, complex dielectric spectroscopy) too, more is possible in principle than is widely achieved in practice, and a detailed examination of the difficulties is called for. The paper summarises the results of such assessments, and reviews the future potential of this well-established method of spectroscopy, including a comparison with the alternative methods promised for the future based on coherent sources and detection."
"Double-beam spectroscopy for ratioing is not as easily achieved in Fourier interferometry as it is in conventional slit spectroscopy because the ratioing has to be done in the recovered spectrum and not in the interferogram. But double-beam differencing spectroscopy can be done successfully in the interferogram domaine of Fourier spectroscopy [1-10]. Such a technique is especially useful if a sample shows only small variations in absorptivity or reflectivity compared to a refence standard."
"The first indication that non-polar materials might show dielectric absorption and dispersion in the high-frequency region came from the microwave vork of Whiffen [1] on non-dipolar liquids such as carbon tetrachloride and benzene. Günthard and his colleagues [2] later detected the infrared “tail” of this absorption in the frequency region above 50 cm−1 but it vas only with the vork of Chantry et al. [3] and of Gabelnick and Strauss [4] that the absorption bands were completely characterised. They were then shown to be similar in profile to the bands observed for polar liquids [5] but about one order of magnitude weaker. Since that time much theoretical effort has been deployed in attempts to understand the origin of this absorption process. These theories are usually couched in terms of the complex relative permittivity ε' = ε' - i ε” whereas the quantity usually measured at submillimetre frequencies is the complex refractive index ň = n - i α/4Πv where n is the refractive index, a is the pover absorption coefficient (usually expressed in Neper/cm) and α is the wavenumber (in cm−1). The two systems are however readily related by Maxwell's celebrated equation v = (ň)2"
"The well-known advantages of two-beam interferometry over dispersive techniques of spectrometry refer to detector-noise limited circumstances. As detectors improve and much higher signal-to-noise ratios are expected, the advantages are gained only by fully exploiting other basic aspects of two-beam interferometry, namely the complementary natures of the two input ports and the two output ports. Conventional ways of doing this can lead to elaborate optical systems; the method of polarised interferometry is, however, a direct and simple method. This was first pointed out in 1969 [1]. Since then the method has been fully developed and used in a number of demanding applications, but has not been fully described in the literature."
"Dispersive Fourier transform spectrometry (DFTS) of liquids [1] in the millimetre and sub-millimetre wave region has been extended to include precise measurement of the complex refractive index ň or the complex relative permittivity ε of medium loss as well as high loss volatile liquids over a wide temperature range (− 80 °C to 80 °C) by the use of variable thickness windowed cell in one active arm of the Michelson type two beam interferometer. In the past these measurements were restricted to liquids of relatively low vapour pressure because of the necessity to use a free layer of liquid. An excess of liquid vapour absorbs radiation and gives its own characteristic spectrum [2]. The free layer method and subtraction [3,4] and double subtraction [5] procedures enabled investigation of liquids of absorption coefficient a up to 250 Neper/cm. But as the absorption increases it becomes more and more difficult to produce a sufficiently thin plane parallel layer held freely under gravity. However for very absorbing liquids, like water, reflection DFTS [5,6] has been successfully used in which accurate determination of the phase shift and an extremely stable interferometric system are essential."
"Reflection dispersive Fourier transform spectrometric (DFTS) technique has been used to measure the optical constants of liquid vater and heavy water at 19 °C over the frequency range 70 ≤ 450 cm−1. A new liquid cell, with a single crystal hyperpure silicon window of thickness 2.45 mm, has been used. Its design is similar to that previously reported [1]. The interferogram signature FWO(X) obtained at the silicon-air interface is considered as a reference interferogram [2] instead of using a window-mercury reference."
"Optical pumping of organic molecules at pressure < 10 Torr by a molecular infrared laser can produce strong coherent FIR radiation. The TEA-CO2 laser is well suited for this purpose because of its high power and the large number of lines it produces. An apparent disadvantage is the linewidth discrepancy between the TEA-CO2 laser emission and the absorption lines in the FIR laser medium, due to the large pressure difference. As a result of this mismatch the energy conversion efficiency is usually much lower than when a cw CO2 laser is used as a pump. Thus, for example, only 6 FIR laser lines produced by pumping CH3OH with a TEA-CO2 laser have been reported to date, and the maximum reported energy conversion efficiency is ∼10−5 [1], [2]. On the other hand, pumping CH3OH with a cw CO2 laser has produced over 80 FIR lines and the conversion efficiency for many of them is ∼10−3. In principal, the linewidth mismatch can be put to good use by restricting the bandwidth over which the TEA-CO2 laser is allowed to oscillate. The homogeneously broadened gain curve then insures that the laser emission will still be fed by the total population inversion, and the width of the gain curve constitutes a frequency tuning range within which it should be possible to pump many closely spaced transitions in the FIR laser medium. In the experiment reported here a tiltable Ge etalon was introduced into the TEA-CO2 laser cavity to accomplish this purpose. The result was a large increase in conversion efficiency for a number of pump lines, including cases which permitted the observation of 14 new FIR laser lines."
"With the extension of available laser wavelengths into regions of the spectrum previously unattainable, especially in the infrared [1], laser induced photochemistry is becoming a valuable approach for both analysis and synthesis of compounds. In the field of isotope separation [2], used for uranium enrichment, the advantage of laser photochemistry over earlier methods is especially marked, and results in order-of-magnitude cost savings over the next most cost effective method."
"We have used the far infrared absorption techniques reported earlier [1] to measure the time resolved electron-neutral collision frequency in pulsed, high pressure glow discharges."
"We have observed more than 50 new laser lines in NH3 pumped by a TEA CO2 laser operating on the R(30) 9.2 Urn transition. The new lines span the region from 9.3 μm to 13.8 μm. FIR cascade emission is responsible for energy transfer from the pumped antisymmetric to the lasing symmetric levels in the V2 band. A novel wedged transverse pumping scheme allows efficient use of pump energy and a compact device design. Application of this laser system to isotope separation of UF6 is discussed."
"In the past few years, a growing interest has been shown by astronomers or astrophysicists for the possibility of observations in the submillimetre range. Should these observations be carried out on board a space platform (and therefore not limited by atmospheric transmission), the submillimetre range presents an even wider interest for the understanding of the universe."
"Significant improvement in laser power and efficiency are reported throughout the 40 – 1222 μm region, using new waveguide laser geometries and output coupling schemes. Best performance is 400 mW at 118 μm at 20% of theoretical efficiency. Scaling laws for higher power are also described."
"Throughout the last years much progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in coherently pumped FIR gas lasers. Diffusion of molecules to the tube walls have been found to be a dominant process for the relaxation to the ground state /1/. Unfortunately, this restricts the operating gas pressure as is evident from experiments and theoretical analysis, as well /1,2/. Since low gas pressures imply a low pump absorption coefficient and saturation parameter, saturation of the absorption transition occurs for relatively small values of pump irradiance. This in turn makes it difficult to achieve a high pump efficiency, i. e., to get most of the pump radiation absorbed in the FIR gas."
"The low working pressures of FIR gas lasers and the associated low absorption per length of the pump radiation make it difficult to achieve an efficient use of the pump power available. Unwanted losses of pump power occur in the optics between pump laser and FIR cavity, in the coupling process, and at mirrors and walls inside the cavity. For the pump efficiency to be high the evacuated FIR cavity must have a high Q for the pump radiation."
"Methyl alcohol (CH3OH) and its deuterated varieties account for a total of 174 wavelengths or about 25% of all of the optically pumped FIR laser lines.[1] In addition, the highest CW power, so far, of over 50 mW has been obtained from the 118.8 μm line of CH3OH. Until now however, none of the transitions have been assigned except for a tentative identification by Chang[2] of the 570.57 μm line as a J' = 11 → 10 transition pumped via an R (10) absorption line. Accurate frequency measurements have recently been performed for a number of the stronger CW laser lines[3] Combining this data with the high dispersion spectra of the CO stretch bands of normal and deuterated methanol,[4] we have been able to assign most of the high power CW laser lines of CH3OH."
"Since the advent of the optically pumped FIR laser, CH3OH has been recognized as a source of many strong lines [1]. Till now, emission has been observed at 80 different wavelengths ranging from 34μm to 1217μm [2], but none of the lines have been assigned to specific transitions."
"The optically pumped waveguide gas lasers in the submillimeter and millimeter wave regions are simple, compact, rugged, efficient, practical, coherent sources. A number of new laser lines have been observed in these lasers. General considerations are given on the attenuation constants of waveguides and the rate equation models. Characteristics of these lasers are reviewed with output coupling, new laser line, mode, polarization, output power, stability, and compactness. Some applications are described briefly. Finally, future aspects are discussed. Waveguide laser Submillimeter wave laser Optical pumping."
"A review on the history and the present state of the art of waveguides for sub-millimeter wave lasers is presented. Theoretical and experimental aspects of waveguides for longitudinally and transversely excited as well as for optically pumped lasers are discussed. This is followed by a comment on investigations of periodic waveguide structures for distributed feedback submillimeter wave lasers."
"Theoretical models for the operating characteristics of both pulsed and CW optically pumped submillimeter lasers are reviewed. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results for the absorption of pump radiation and the submillimeter laser gain is discussed. Rate equation models that have been used are found to be inadequate in several applications and, instead, the quantum mechanical treatment of a three level system must be employed."
"A technique is described which enables narrow-bandpass filters to be made at any predetermined wavelength beyond 50μm and which operate efficiently at 77°K."
"The possibility of enhancing the modulation In an electrooptic single-slab dielectric waveguide by exciting high-order modes in thick slabs was first pointed out by Lotspeich [1]. Later, Buckman [2] showed that, for a three-layer dielectric slab structure, the modulation in the effective refractive index of a guided mode could be made to exceed that of the “bulk” refractive index of the active layer by up to a factor of ng2, where nh2 is the highest refractive index in tne system. This enhancement in modulation of the effective refractive index n, and hence of the propagation constant β, is critically dependent on the value of n in the absence of modulation, which is, in turn, dependent on the layer thickness."
"Many aspects of the submillimeter region have led both microwave and infrared specialists to approach this regime from their respective fields. In overcoming the new technical difficulties, the standard existing techniques have been pushed from both ends to nearly their limit in order to accommodate this new domain. We would like to suggest the inclusion of one technique which has been used in both microwaves and infrared laser applications which has apparently been overlooked. The suggestion is to utilize FTIR type devices in order to achieve electro-optic effects without requiring electro-optic materials."
"When a metallic film is used as a reflector, its thichness need to be great er than the penetration depth d=λ/(4Πnk) to ensure the maximum reflectivity. The penetration depth encreases with the wavelength and, in the infrared and in the millimetre region, the required thickness is usually greater than the standard thickness of reflectors. Costly procedures are often needed for this special requirement."
"Fresnel prisms were extensively studied and used in the optical region of the spectrum /1/. When radiation propagates in a medium towards a surface that separates the given medium from an optically less dense material, then total reflection may occur, when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle of the optically dense medium. Under conditions of total reflection, different components of the radiation field experience different amounts of phase shift and the relative phase shift is given by the well known expression."
"Several workers [1,2,3] have successfully constructed Fabry-Perot interferometers for use in the microwave spectrum by using wire grid arrays. Recently Gustincic [4] was able to build such an interferometer which would effectively rotate the plane of polarization of a reflected wave and transmit without change the wavelength to which it was tuned. This configuration has application in microwave radiometers where it is generally difficult to couple the local oscillator into the mixer without considerable loss of power. Use of a Fabry-Perot interferometer also gives inherent single sideband operation and rejects local oscillator noise at the signal frequency. In this paper results of calculations on the performance of wire grid arrays are presented."
"Highly sensitive spectrometers based on using backward-wave tubes with a resolution of Δγ/γ ∼ 10−5 in the wave range 4 mm ± 0.2 mm has been designed. The quasioptical measuring circuits of spectrometers based on using instruments with one-dimensional wire grids."
"The increasing interest in the application of bolometers and photoconductors in infrared astronomy has stimulated considerable research effort during the past few years in improving the sensitivities of these detectors under low and high background conditions. A review of these detectors will be given and their applications in photometry and spectroscopy with ground based and airborne infrared astronomical systems will be discussed."
"Description of a new method to grow very thin single crystals (0.5 μm thick) on a metal surface with the right orientation to make far Infrared pyroelectric detectors."
"The prospects for realization of low noise coherent detectors in the 25 μm - 100 μm region are critically assessed. Use of high efficiency Schottky-barrier converters can be extended to the submillimeter region through the use of appropriate diode materials."
"Video detection and heterodyne mixing with ultra-small Schottky diodes are observed between 70 and 1222 μm and the results characterized in terms of key diode parameters. The implications of these data for optimum design of submillimeter-wave diodes are discussed with reference to recent analytical work."
"We have developed two types of 4He temperature composite submillimeter wave bolometers which use metal film absorbing elements. Dark electrical noise-equivalent-powers of 2×10−15 W/√Hz and 3×10−14 W/√Hz have been measured in large area bolometers with superconducting and semiconducting thermometers, respectively. Experiments confirm the theoretically predicted frequency independent absorptivity of ∼ 0.5 in a single pass."
"High resistivity extrinsic gallium arsenide photoconductors are well-known detectors for the 100-400 micron region, Such detectors are usually operated in a dc series circuit with a matching load resistor [1-3]. Feedback amplifier techniques are sometimes used to reduce the total capacitance, thus increasing the electrical bandwidth [4]. In general, such devices have reduced sensitivity when operated with wide electrical bandwidths."
"Gallium-doped germanium detectors for use at wavelengths as long as 130 μm have been tested with low optical backgrounds characteristic of the space environment. These tests were performed in order to determine the limits on the performance of well-behaved submillimeter photoconductors for space use."
"We report of the strong photo-conductivity response of doped stannic oxide single crystals for submillimeter radiation. As confirmed up to 120 kG the magnetic field dependence of the photo-conductivity response is negligible. This fact admits in a magneto-transmission experiment the stannic-oxide detector to be positioned directly behind the investigated sample in the presence of the external magnetic field. Design and operation of the detector system are discussed in detail."
"Quantum counters converting infrared radiation to visible light have been proposed by Bloembergen [1] and were realized for the near infrared [2]."
"The production of high power submillimeter radiation by 200 MW level CO2 laser pumping of various gases such as CH3 F and D2O has been studied. A number of cavity and amplifier configurations were used to produce narrow linewidth radiation. A 384.6 μm D2 O oscillator amplifier system was used to produce a 12.7 millijoule, 195 kW, 70 MHz wide single mode beam in 60-70 nsec pulses."
"An optically pumped, submillimeter wavelength, waveguide laser has been designed to operate as a regenerative amplifier. Small-signal gains of 9 dB have been measured for cw operation on the 372.8 μm transition of CH3CN. System design and operating characteristics of the oscillator-amplifier configuration are described."
"Performance and scaling of our high-power narrow-line pulsed 496μm laser is under investigation [1]. In addition, the performance of other high-power lasers in the 50-2000μm band is being studied."
"A submillimeter laser source for an ion-temperature diagnostic of a thermonuclear plasma will require approximately a one megawatt narrowlinewidth pulse with a duration of 150–300 nsec [1]. An oscillator-amplifier system optically pumped by a CO2 TEA laser system of the type developed by Chang and Bridges is being constructed for this purpose [2]. To meet these requirements a wavelength insensitive submillimeter oscillator, based on an unstable resonator cavity design, is being developed to drive a large volume submillimeter amplifier. The oscillator will be optically pumped by a 15 joule TEA CO2 laser and the amplifier is to be pumped by a 150 joule TEA CO2 laser. Presently, the oscillator characteristics are being determined by using the 496 μm CH3F line and the 447 CH3I line."
"An optically pumped amplifier suitable for use in a far infrared receiver system has been constructed and evaluated. Relevant parameters, including gain and noise characteristics, have been studied and are reported."
"Generation of far infrared (FIR) laser radiation by means of optical pumping of molecules has received increasing attention over the past few years [1]. In the course of the development of FIR sources two important features have been largely neglected; (i) the assignment of the pump and FIR transitions; (ii) the detailed tuning behavior of the FIR emission. Knowledge of these two points is essential for a complete understanding of the optical pumping mechanism, and for assessing the full potential of various FIR laser sources and their extension to new spectral ranges. The assignment of CH3OH transitions is presented in another talk. This communication discusses the frequency characteristics of the FIR emission."
"Up to now methyl alcohol has been the most fertile molecule for generating far infrared laser radiation via CO2 laser optical pumping [1]. Nevertheless, of the numerous CH3OH submillimeter emission lines and their corresponding pump transitions, most of the spectroscopic assignments have yet to be made. Detailed knowledge of the quantum numbers, relaxation rates and dipole matrix elements is essential for assessing further potential of these lasers as sources and for new fundamental studies of the physics of three level systems."
"In 1968, Pantell et al. [1] proposed that strong submillimeter radiation could be produced by coherent scattering of a microwave signal from a counterstreaming relativistic electron beam. The merit of this proposal is clear since it involves the conversion of incident photons at a low frequency, ωo, into an output of scattered photons at a high frequency, ωs, via the Doppler effect. Thus, according to the Manley-Rowe relationship, the ratio of output wave energy to incident wave energy can be as large as Ws/Wo - ωs/ωo and good device efficiency is possible. This may be contrasted to the case of optically pumped submillimeter lasers which convert high frequency photons into lower frequency photons and thus produce an output wave that is much weaker than the pump wave so that efficiency is inherently low."
"It has taken nearly twenty years for practical development of the electron cyclotron maser. The initial theoretical notions were understood by R. Q. Twiss in 1957, but the first clear experimental demonstration did not occur until 1964. Today, in the Soviet Union, these devices are being built which deliver kilowatt level cw power at submillimeter wavelengths, with high efficiency. This paper traces these developments, particularily during the first decade; after this Western activities in this field became rather somnolent, as the initiative passed to the Soviet scientists."
"The existence of essentially isotropic homogeneous cosmic background radiation with the spectrum of a 3 K blackbody places important limits on cosmological speculations. This radiation has been the subject of intensive experimental investigation for more than a decade. Current research centers around measurements of the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation at submillimeter wavelengths, and measurements of the anisotropy of this radiation from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. In this talk we will discuss some of the difficulties of making these measurements and summarize the present status of the field. In 1948, Alpher and Herman [1] reported theoretical investigations of “big bang” cosmological models in an effort to explain the abundance of the chemical elements. They concluded that their model universe was filled with isotropic homogeneous blackbody radiation with a characteristic temperature of a few degrees Kelvin. This radiation was emitted by the ∼ 3,000 K cosmic plasma and has not interacted with matter since the plasma cooled sufficiently to form hydrogen. Because of the subsequent expansion of the universe, this radiation has cooled to the present temperature of ∼ 3 K."
"Scientific Overview Astronomical observations at submillimeter wavelengths, between 40 μm and 1 mm, study astro-physical sources and problems which differ from and complement those accessible at other wavelengths. Although a few nonthermal sources are known, most of the radiation observed in this spectral band from astronomical sources outside of the solar system comes from extended clouds of gas and dust with temperatures in the range 10-500 K and densities between 10 and 106 atoms cm−3. The submillimeter radiation consists of both continuous emission from the sub-micron sized dust particles, which make up ∼ 1% of the total mass, and line emission from atomic and molecular species in the gas. The energy radiated at submillimeter wavelengths is generally supplied to such a cloud in the form of ultraviolet, optical, or near infrared radiation from stars or other luminous objects which is absorbed by the dust and goes into heating the dust and gas. Since only a small amount of dust is required to convert ultraviolet and optical radiation into submillimeter radiation, there are many astronomical sources from which most or all of the observed energy lies in this spectral region, although the objects which heat the dust and gas differ from one submillimeter source to another. Thus intense submillimeter radiation is seen from the center of our Galaxy [1] and from diffusely distributed matter within the galactic plane [2], where the heating is probably due to normal stars; from the nuclei of several other galaxies [3], where exotic heating sources may be important; and from shells of dust and gas which are expelled from and heated by evolving stars [4]."
"The paper which will be read at this conference will be a review paper in the sense that it will discuss recent and current research in submillimetre atmospheric spectroscopy within an historical framework. This Digest is intended as a guide to the topics which will be considered in the paper."
"In the frame of the ASSESS-1 mission, a polarising interferometer (D.H. Martin, E. F. Puplett, Infrared Physics, 10,105,1970) has been flown on a NASA CV990 aircraft at the lower limit of the stratosphere, with the purpose of measuring sky emission in the spectral range 3–40 cm−1. Due to the proximity of the tropopause during flight, 1 imb sounding measurements were not practicable and the scientific objectives were limited to the exploration of the spectral assignments and concentrations of ozone and minor constituents of the atmosphere and in so doing to test developments of technique. Previous experiments (J.E.Beckman, J.E.Harries, Appl. Opt.,14, 470, 1975) had shown the need for improved techniques that would give a resolution of at least 0.01 cm−1 unapodised so that over-lapping emission lines from different constituents are resolved, that would allow an interferogram to be recorded in no more than a few minutes because significant changes can occur in the atmospheric signal observed from an aircraft in such time intervals, and that would give measurements of emission in absolute terms in order to make possible quantitative estimates of constituents. The changes required in the instrumentation to give these improvements were the introduction of a fast data acquisition system, the adoption of the polarised in terferometric method both to suppress the effects of signal fluctuations and to allow continuous reference to blackbody calibration sources (B.Carli, IEEE Trans., HTT-22, 1094, 1972), and the incorporation of greatly improved germanium bolometric detectors (P.A.R. Ade and S. El-Atawy, personal communication)."
"The low spectral emission of black bodies in the FIR and the heretofore unavailability of oscillators or other active networks has resulted in very little knowledge of atmospheric characteristics. This paper describes the beginning of a program for theoretical and experimental measurements of the atmosphere."
"The thermal radiation from the atmosphere is an unwanted contribution of noise from the standpoint of communications, whereas it may provide valuable information about various atmospheric parameters from a remote sensing standpoint. The monitoring of this radiation by spaceborn sensors has been done successfully at microwave and infrared wavelengths. The submillimeter region is still essentially untouched and could give further insight into atmospheric parameters although the interaction of these waves and the troposphere is highly complex and not yet completely described. An estimation of the noise levels for rainy atmospheres is a first step in this direction and shows some of the inherent limitations."
 "There has been a recent impetus to develop submillimeter spectral line receivers for the study of the upper atmosphere. This paper describes the present status of a program sponsored by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop room temperature superheterodyne spectral line receivers with equivalent noise temperatures of approximately one thousand degrees in the range from 100 to 1000 GHz, suitable for flight applications. The program plan involves initial development at the lower frequencies with the objective of direct scaling of the devices up to the shorter wavelengths. The first step in this program was the construction of a complete 1.5 mm receiver based on quasi-optical techniques utilizing presently available klystron local oscillator sources and Schottky diode mixing elements. The central components in the receiver front end are the local oscillator injection circuitry and the quasi-optical mixer mount which are discussed in the following."
"The photo response induced by far infrared radiation interacting with electrons in silicon inversion layers at 4.2°K can be associated with at least five distinct processes. Of these, four can be attributed directly to the physics of the quasi-two dimensional electron system. The response can be either photoresistive or photo-conductive, each type characterized by a distinct response time, magnitude and temperature dependence as well as a resonant or broad band response with respect to photon energy. It is now accepted that as the electron density is increased, initially an electron localization occurs as evidenced by a thermally activated conductivity. In high mobility samples at electron densities greater than ∼ 5×10” electrons/cm2 the conductivity becomes metallic in nature. The observed responses manifest both of these conditions as well as the quantization induced by the electric field perpendicular to the surface."
"Experiments are presented of launching THz acoustic waves by converting photons of a high-power, optically-pumped FIR laser into isoenergetic phonons at the surface of suitable crystals, thus making possible ultrasonics in the frequency range of acoustic dispersion."
"The volumn fraction wC of crystallized substance in a bulk polymer influences the shape as well as the intensities of the absorption spectrum. The spectra of poly-(ethyleneterephthalat), polyethylene and similar linear polymers are reported and discussed."
"n-GaAs cooled to 4.2°K is impact ionized with X-band microwave pulses. Fast rise-time modulation of 337 μm radiation is observed. The GaAs is less absorptive in the ionized state than in the unionized state."
"The influence of the finite size of LiF and KCl crystals on the infrared spectrum was investigated by measuring the spectral thermal emissivity. A series of radiative modes were detected in thin layers and in microcrystals of various shapes."
"A modified pyroelectric detector is used to measure the surface resistivity of evaporated gold at 890 GHz. The value of 0.65 Ω per square yields a ratio of measured-to-theoretical surface resistivity of approximately 2.2."
"The interatomic forces in a crystal are usually strongly dependent on the interatomic spacing and consequently the lattice potential energy for a crystal can generally be written as a power series in the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions. If such an expansion is terminated at the quadratic terms, then this constitutes the so-called harmonic approximation. In the harmonic approximation the lattice vibrations are true normal modes such that if energy is channeled uniquely into any one lattice mode, then it will remain undissipated in that mode. The harmonic approximation would therefore predict, for instance, that the spectral profiles of lattice vibrations would be a set of undamped, temperature-independent resonances. These and other such predictions are, of course, in marked discord with experimental evidence. As a result, the anharmonic terms in a lattice potential must be considered if a full understanding of many of the physical properties of solids is to be achieved."
"This study investigates the modifications in the mid-infrared transmission and far infrared reflectivity of polar crystals that have been colored by ionizing radiation."
"In previous experiments with an intense, relativistic, electron beam in an external magnetic field, [1] negative mass instability lead to coherent, electromagnetic radiation ('cyclotron maser'). Large radiated power levels were produced at wavelengths of several centimeters corresponding to the fundamental cyclotron frequency, and also at mm wavelengths corresponding to harmonics. However, the process was not expected to result in coherent submillimeter radiation; the largest harmonic number at which the cyclotron maser process produces coherent radiation is predicted [2] to be n = W⊥/ΔW⊥ ≤ 10 for an intense beam (where ΔW⊥/W⊥ is the fractional spread in electron transverse energy). Nevertheless, in experiments employing a cyclotron maser geometry strong submillimeter radiation was observed [3]."
"Stimulated scattering of electromagnetic radiation off a magnetized relativistic electron beam is shown to be effective as a frequency conversion mechanism. Enhanced scattering results if the pump frequency is approximately equal to the electron's cyclotron frequency."
"We have recently concentrated our theoretical effort on two methods of producing submillimeter radiation with intense relativistic electron beams, The cyclotron maser instability and the magneto-resonant scattering of electromagnetic radiation by an electron beam both appear to be viable mechanisms for the generation of submillimeter radiation. The linear theories of the two instabilities have been derived and analyzed [1-4] but to answer the natural question of how efficient the two mechanisms are one has to develop an understanding of the nonlinear behavior. The methods of computer simulation developed for studying plasma phenomena are particularly useful for an analysis of the nonlinear development of the two instabilities we are concerned with."
"We report a configuration of pulsed, intense, relativistic electron beam and rippled magnetic field which shows promise for production of electromagnetic energy in the wavelength range below 1 mm. The technique has been studied theoretically [1] and experimentally [2] in the microwave regime and a similar mechanism has been proposed as a means of generating shorter wavelength radiation [3]. Our apparatus has produced radiation at wavelengths in the 1-2 mm range at power levels of roughly 50 kW."
"A cylindrical wave guide lined with thin dielectric layer can be used as a slow wave structure. As the dielectric filling factor becomes arbitrarily small and as the dielectric constant of the load material approaches unity the wavelength at which the phase velocity of the guide modes become less than the speed of light becomes arbitrarily short. The azimuthally symmetric TM modes of this structure will couple to an axially propagating electron stream and the resulting linearized dispersion relation has roots which correspond to exponentially growing waves. Relativistic electron beams will permit operation at millimeter wavelengths without resorting to high loss dielectric loads. The intensity of the available beams is such that high power operation can be expected. Intense relativistic electron beams propagating in structures of the type described above have already been used to make coherent sources at wavelengths in the 5mm range [1,2]."
"We consider a basically new effect that to our knowledge has not as yet been observed, only calculated (1,2,3). It involves the production of frequency shifted narrowband electromagnetic radiation by the scattering, in a suitable medium, of coherent electromagnetic waves from relativistic charged particles. The frequency of the scattered wave can be either upshifted or downshifted relative to that of the incident wave. Only the upward shift is considered here; the down shift will be covered in the following paper (4). We first argue that the effect is to be expected on very general physical grounds and then present the solution to Maxwell's equations for a model that exhibits its salient features."
"The excitation of intense, tunable submillimeter and far infrared waves by the interaction, through the mechanism described in the preceding paper (1), of microwave and infrared sources with relativistic electron beams in frequency-dispersive media is discussed. The possibility of using artificial dielectrics (spatially dispersive polarizability) is then described."
"We have found that it is possible to produce submillimeter microwaves with the cyclotron maser instability at reasonable efficiencies and high power levels. The configuration used to study the instability is shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity we have chosen a parallel plate geometry in which electrons travel along a guide magnetic field and execute gyro orbits in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is the perpendicular energy which is responsible for the maser instability. The gyrating electrons interact and feed energy to the electromagnetic TEon modes between the parallel plates. This instability is a relativistic effect and we discuss it in more detail in the section on the Physical Mechanism."
 "The reflection of electromagnetic radiation from a relativistic mirror has several intriguing properties. The backscattered radiation is Doppler shifted to a higher frequency, and with efficient interaction its energy and power are also increased. As the mirror velocity approaches that of light, these effects become substantial. In a recent publication [1], preliminary experimental observations are reported which are in agreement with a simple theory of microwave reflection from the front of an intense, relativistic electron beam. Since the original work was performed, refinements have been made in the theory and experiment. These refinements will be discussed after briefly reviewing the earlier work."
"There has been a great deal of interest in the production of high power microwaves in the mm and sub mm bands using high current relativistic electron beams. Coherent radiation from the cyclotron maser configuration has been produced at powers in excess of 100 MW in the Ku band [1], 8 MW in the Ka band, and 1 MW in the V band [2]. We report here on an investigation into the radiation produced by the interaction of an intense REB with a slow wave structure. In this case, both the beam and the structure are of rectangular cross section. The structure is open at the sides; thus the dispersion characteristics of the guide are independent of its width. This allows an arbitrary choice for the structure and beam width, and makes possible a reduction in the usual scaling of power with the frequency from P α 1/f5/2 to P α 1/f3/2."
"The Doppler shift and reflection coefficients are calculated for reflection of an EM wave from a moving ionization front in a stationary gas. It is suggested that this process can be used to upshift microwaves to submillimeter waves."
"The use of submillimeter waves in cyclotron resonance experiments with semiconductors has the advantage that due to the higher frequency (in comparison with microwaves) either the ωt (ω = cyclotron frequency eB/m, t = relaxation time) values can be increased or materials with lower mobility can be explored. Usually transmission-type spectrometers in the Faraday configuration with molecular lasers are employed. Due to the small wavelengths a number of problems arise which must be kept in mind."
"Magnetic excitations are the collective modes of a system of spins or magnetic moments which are usually observed in the ordered ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic state of the system. The frequencies of these excitations fall in the microwave range and in the far infrared or submillimeter spectral region, up to 1000 cm−1."
 "The electronic excitation (Lyman) spectra and the photo-ionization thresholds of many imperfections in semiconductors occur in the far infrared as a result of the small binding energies of the charge carriers bound to them. Group V donors and group III acceptors in Si and Ge are the classic examples and represent solid state analogs of the hydrogen atom. The paper will review the results on absorption, photoconductivity, and photothermal ionization spectra obtained with high resolution grating spectrometers, interferometers, and lasers, and discuss the effects of external perturbations on such spectra."
"An intriguing feature of amorphous dielectrics is the presence of low frequency anharmonic modes, these are qualified as “anomalous” since they contribute to large deviations from the expected crystalline behavior. The first clear evidence that these anomalous modes represented a general phenomenon in glassy materials was obtained from the low temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements of Zeller and Pohl [1]. For a variety of glassy materials they found a linear temperature dependence of the specific heat and a thermal conductivity whose temperature dependence and magnitude were the same for all glasses. Extensive measurements of the specific heat [2] of a large number of glasses have confirmed the presence of anomalous excitations in the energy range below a few cm−1. Additional evidence for such low frequency excitations comes from ultrasonic attenuation experiments [3]. Finally the observation of boundary scattering in small glass fibers has shown that Debye-like phonons carry the heat (as in a crystalline solid) and that the excess excitations observed in specific heat measurements do not themselves carry heat through the crystal [4]. To account for these special modes a localized tunneling model [5,6] has been proposed in which atoms, ions or groups of particles quantum mechanically tunnel between two or more equivalent sites. The linear dependence of the specific heat has been obtained from this model by including a statistical distribution of barrier heights and asymmetries for the local potential. One straightforward prediction which this model makes is that the temperature dependence of the far infrared absorption coefficient should be determined by the occupation numbers of a small number of energy levels associated with the tunneling manifold. For example a distribution of infrared-active two-level systems will produce an infrared absorption which decreases with increasing temperature in a well-defined way. In this talk, we shall discuss a variety of measurements of the temperature-dependent absorption coefficient of amorphous dielectrics in the far infrared. In one restricted temperature and frequency regime a decrease in absorption coefficient with increasing temperature is observed as expected while in another temperature and frequency range the absorption coefficient increases with increasing temperature [7]. A complete mapping of the absorption coefficient versus frequency and temperature for a number of glasses demonstrates that both ground state and excited state transitions are observed in the far infrared. In addition the results are consistent with the presence of widely spaced manifolds of energy levels. All of these results can be explained with an asymmetric tunneling potential model. At frequencies above 10 cm−1 a modest temperature dependence indicates that resonant mode transitions are being measured. Apparently the spatial inhomogeneities in glass provide a natural habitat not only for Debye-like phonons but also for localized modes, resonant modes and tunneling states - excitations which in the past were associated exclusively with slightly perturbed single crystals [8]."
"The recent development of optically pumped far infrared (FIR) lasers has resulted in relatively powerful, quasi-tunable sources whose applications are just beginning to be explored. This paper reports on the use of such a laser to make transmission measurements in liquid H2O, the semiconductor GaAs, and the high temperature superconductor V3Si. The laser results are compared to other methods."
"Instabilities In CO2 lasers and FIR lasers necessitate an automatic means of control in order to achieve stable FIR output power over a long period of time. The digital control circuit described maybe one solution to the problem,(fig. 1)"
"Using hybrid capacitive and inductive mesh mirrors, the characteristics of optically pumped FIR lasers were investigated in the range 70 μm to 1.2 mm and found to produce single mode EH11 outputs at the mW level."
"The mode losses in hollow-circular waveguide resonators for far-infrared lasers are studied. Theoretical formalisms have been developed for the waveguide resonator which consists of both dielectric and metallic tubes with dielectric films and metallic grids deposited on mirrors and waveguide walls. Both propagation loss and the coupling loss for low-loss modes, circular magnetic and electric modes, and hybrid modes are investigated theoretically. A computer program was written to solve the equations numerically."
"Dicke superradiance has been observed in far infrared pulses from homogeneously broadened CH3F optically pumped by a CO2 TEA laser. The superradiant character of the emission has been verified by the pressure dependence of the height, width, and delay of the pulses."
"A rectangular metal-dielectric waveguide has been constructed to observe the Stark effect on a CO2 laser pumped FIR laser. AC and dc Stark effects will be discussed."
"A Stark cell containing methanol at pressures around 200μm Hg has been used to modulate 119μm submillimeter radiation generated by a methanol waveguide laser. Applying an electric field across the cell shifted the absorption band of methanol away from the laser frequency."
"Low electric field Stark effects on an optically pumped FIR waveguide laser have “been investigated. Modifications of output characteristics produced by DC and AC Stark fields are discussed."
"A high-frequency mode of antiferromagnetic resonance and twomagnon absorption at 34.6 and 54.7 cm−1 (at T→O K), respectively, have been observed. Prom the experimental data we have calculated HA=115 kOe, gz=7±2 (at HE=160 kOe and g⊥=3.3). The twomagnon absorption is treated as a simultaneous excitation of two magnons near the Brillouin-zone boundary, one of which belongs to the low-frequency gapless branch and the other - to the weak dispersion high-frequency branch."
"Electronic transitions and localised vibrations of the compensation F− ion have been found in the case of rare earth ions, while resonant modes are observed in the case of several transition ions."
"The anharmonic interactions of the ferroelectric mode in both the pseudo displacive and hydrogen bonded ferroelectrics are generally considered to be very strong, and an understanding of the anharmonic self-energies associated with these modes should lead to a better understanding of the nature of the ferroelectric transition. If it is assumed that in these materials the frequency dependent lattice contribution to the complex dielectric constant is determined primarily by the summation term associated with the ferroelectric mode, and contributions from other q ≈ 0 modes are ignored, then an estimate can be made of the frequency dependence of the anharmonic self-energy over a limited frequency range from experimental measurements of the dielectric response together with a measurement of the thermal strain self-energy shift of the mode arising from the thermal expansion of the crystal."
"In IV-VI compounds there is a possibility for a structural instability due to a transition from a high temperature NaCl to a low temperature rhombohedral structure. Whereas in GeTe and in mixed crystals Ge1-XPbXTe, Pb1-XSnXTe this transition takes place at finite temperatures in pure PbTe until now no positive Curie temperature has been reported. It is, however, well established that the static dielectric constant is temperature dependent, i.e. PbTe exhibits a paraelectric behaviour."
"In 1964 Barker and HOPfield|1| presented a coupled mode theory to describe the infrared spectra of KH2PO4|KDP| type ferroelectrics. Since that date a great amount of work, both experimental and theoretical, has been done in this field. The experimental techniques employed have been chiefly those of Raman scattering|2, 3, 4|, and infrared power spectroscopy |5, 6, 7|."
"Josephson mixers with a conversion loss LC ≤ 13 db and a noise temperature T ∼ 100 K are reported for λ ≥ 0.95 mm. Their potentials and limitations in noise, bandwidth, drive power and stability are discussed."
"The Josephson self oscillator-mixer has potential detector applications at submillimeter frequencies. A quantitative investigation of noise effects and of its physical origin is performed with measurements in the frequency range 145GHz–891GHz."
"A sensitive heterodyne receiver has “been constructed for use in the submillimeter wave region. The application of a laser as a local oscillator (LO) in the fundamental mixing mode greatly improves the sensitivity compared to systems with klystron LO's in the harmonic mixing mode, especially in the 1 THz region. The possibilities for application in submillimeter spectroscopy are demonstrated with a tunable receiver for the region around 891 GHz employing an HCN laser as a LO. The high sensitivity obtained with this system shows good prospects for spectroscopy in the 1-5 THz region."
"We present a study of far infrared heterodyne detection using the bulk photoconductivity associated with negative donor ion states (D− centers) in n-type silicon at temperatures near 2K. A measured quantum efficiency η of 1% and a response time τ of lnsec indicate that this detector provides an increase in sensitivity and bandwidth compared with other presently available detectors (e.g. GaAs) in the 120 to 500μm wavelength region."
"Heterodyne detection at the quantum level of sub-millimeter wave radiation has been demonstrated on numerous occasions. At this time sufficient local oscillator power to reach this limit has only been available at the discrete wavelength of existing lasers in the mid-IR. It is, however, reasonable to expect that in the near future sufficient powerful sources tunable over useful bands will become available for the whole region classified as sub-millimeter wave. In the sensing of low levels of radiation, receivers of this kind can thus provide the experimentor with an alternative to sensors of the classic kind, consisting of a quantum counter or power detector preceeded by some form of optical filtering device as exemplified by narrow band filters, Fabry-Perot resonators and transform devices such as Fourier transform spectrometers and Hadamard encoders."
"The characteristic parameters of plasma in the tokamak, the mirror and the bumpy torus devices used in controlled thermonuclear fusion research are such that submillimeter wavelengths are required for a number of important diagnostics. These diagnostics include measurements of plasma density, electron cyclotron radiation levels, ion temperature, and impurity-concentration. It may also be possible to use sub-millimeter radiation to measure transverse thermal conductivity in a tokamak plasma by local heating and to determine the poloidal magnetic field by cyclotron absorption and measurements."
"Intense (kW) stimulated Raman emission has been observed from D2O vapor at 50.3 μm. The process was identified by measuring the frequency difference between the emitted radiation and the rotational transition center frequency using an external absorption cell technique."
"Dispersion and absorption measurements on polar liquids can give information on the rotation of molecules and their interaction in dense phase. The relaxation spectrum even for simple liquids is very broad and extends from microwaves into the far infrared (FIR). In order to obtain details of the orientational motion this spectrum must be measured accurately."
"Very high sensitivity and spectrometric resolution have been obtained for gaseous paramagnetic molecules by using fixed-tuned submillimeter lasers and tunable magnetic fields [1-4]. This technique, commonly called laser magnetic resonance spectrometry (LMRS), has an electric analogy, Stark shift laser spectrometry [5,6], which, in addition to providing ultra high resolution for molecular spectroscopy also holds considerable promise as an analytical tool for gases. The same technique at longer wavelengths has been successfully applied to chemical analyses [7,8] but with less sensitivity than that expected with sub-millimeter lasers. Work is currently underway at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory to develop Stark shift spectrometry at submillimeter wavelengths with emphasis toward characterizing its analytical capabilities."
"The requirements for the performance of molecular beam electric resonance experiments at wavelengths shorter than one millimeter are discussed. Examples relevant to current experiments are presented, and comparisons made with millimeter and near IR experiments."
"Methoxy (CH3O) is symmetric rotor free radical, a rara avis never before detected by spectroscopic means. It is a reactive trace constituent of the atmosphere and probably is also present in the interstellar gas, where radio astronomers have in recent years found large quantities of its close chemical relatives methanol (CH3OH) and formaldehyde (H2CO)"
"The simplest kind of collision induced far infrared absorption occurs for binary mixtures of rare gases, such as for instance, in an equimolar mixture of argon and helium. In collisions of such unlike atoms, under high pressures for instance, the respective electron clouds of the atoms are deformed and an induced dipole moment persists during the time the two atoms are sufficiently close to each other. The presence of this dipole moment leads to a strong far infrared absorption which is associated with pure translational transitions and this was first reported on by Bosomworth and Gush [1] for various inert gas mixtures."
"A parallel plate Stark cell has been used for measurements on millimeter wave transitions of the hydrogen sulfide molecule. With this cell and phase matched sources, high precision values for molecular dipole moments are achieved."
"We have measured the electron-density, nee, of the plasma confined by the magnetic field in a tokamak (in particular, the M.I.T. Alcator) by using a submillimeter interferometer. The interferometer, shown in Fig. 1, contains twin optically pumped waveguide lasers. The twin lasers operate at a wavelength of 118.8 micrometers (CH3 OH) but are detuned with respect to each other by approximately one MHz for modulation purposes. This wavelength is appropriate for measurement of electron densities ≥ 1014 cm−3."
"Principle of the apparatus The principle of the interferometer built for the Tokamak in operation at Fontenay-aux-Roses (T.F.R.) is as follows : the frequency of the reference beam of the interferometer is slightly Doppler shifted with the aid of a cylindrical grating which rotates at a constant speed. This beam is then recombined with the probing beam. The resulting beat signal is monitored by a square law (pyroelectric) detector. The phase shift ⊘ experienced by the probing beam upon traversing the plasma is thus transferred to this low frequency signal. The value of ⊘ is then deduced from the time interval Δt elapsing between the zero crossings of this signal and the corresponding zero crossings of a reference signal which have the same frequency but with a fixed phase. The time Δt is measured by an electronic clock whose frequency exceeds that of the beat signal by three orders of magnitude."
"Plasma interferometry in the submillimeter far infrared (FIR) spectral range (50 um ≲ λ ≲ 1mm) is becoming a well established method for electron density(ne) measurement in the regime 1013cm−3 ≲ ne ≲ 1016cm−3 [1–4]. With all the interferometers cited the phase shift is measured as an average over the cross section of the radiation beam. To obtain phase information in a direction perpendicular to the beam, the plasma either has to be scanned with one beam or probed with several beams[5], analogous to multichannel microwave interferometry. A different way to obtain this information could be the recording of two-dimensional interferograms, analogous to optical interferometry. In the FIR the feasability of two-dimensional interferometry first of all depends on the availability of two-dimensional detection schemes sufficiently sensitive to compensate for the relatively modest FIR laser powers. We report here some experiments and considerations concerning the recording of two-dimensional FIR interferograms by means of evaporography and pyroelectric imaging."
"We report a study of electron density fluctuations in the Adiabatic Toroidal Compressor (ATC) Tokamak using heterodyne detection to study the small angle scattering of CO2 laser radiation. The scattering apparatus described below allows us to study fluctuations with wavelengths from 1 to 10−3cm, frequencies from 10kHz to 1GHz and fluctuation amplitudes ñn as low as 10−5 (where ñ is the total fluctuation amplitude and n is the electron density)[1]. We observed scattering due to density fluctuations at frequencies ω/2Π below 2MHz and wavelengths λ from 0.3 to 1cm These fluctuations are predicted to be driven in contained plasmas by density and temperature gradients. The observed turbulence may play an important role in electron transport phenomena in prototype fusion reactors similar to the ATC."
"A pulsed 496 μm CH3 F laser has produced breakdown in various gases in a magnetic field at cyclotron resonance. Resonance lineshapes in helium, hydrogen and oxygen are compared and related to properties of these gases."
"Crystalline quartz resonant reflectors are an extremely useful and versatile component for use in FIR diagnostic systems. The lov absorptivity and high index of refraction allow beam splitters with a wide range of reflectivities. Design, construction, and operating considerations will be discussed."
"Surface polaritons are electromagnetic modes that propagate along the interface separating two media and whose fields decay exponentially away from the interface [1,2]. Surface polaritons exist in spectral ranges in which one of the media has a negative dielectric constant while the other medium has a positive dielectric constant. The negative (positive) dielectric-constant medium is referred to as the active (inactive) medium. The “source” for a surface polariton is provided for by a surface polarization charge at the interface due to the active medium."
"The simple two-oscillator model, which works well for bulk semiconductors in the far infrared (FIR)[1], can also be applied to epitaxial film/substrate systems with the assumption of an abrupt interface. This picture is not wholly satisfactory. Tennant and Cape [2] had to assume that the free carriers at the interface had a smooth spatial variation to fit FIR reflection data for a PbSnTe film on a PbSnTe substrate. Here we report on and compare three systems—PbSe on NaCl, PbSnTe on PbSnTe, and InAs on GaAs—which should have different kinds of interface behavior."
"Measurements of absorption coefficient and photoconductivity have been made at sub-mm wavelengths in Ga-doped Ge single crystals with concentrations around the metal to nonmetal transition at temperatures down to 1.4K. The photoconductivity associated with A+ states is nearly 3 times as large as that associated with D− states of n-Ge for the concentrations studied."
"Decay-kinetics of exciton and electron-hole drop systems in highly photoexcited germanium crystal are investigated by observing time-resolved far-infrared laser magneto-absorption. Magnetospectroscopy of doped material is also studied over 48 - 220 μm."
"We report of the submillimeter-lasermagneto transmission of pure n-type InSb in a MIS-arrangement as function of the applied gate voltage. From the recorded data we derive a strong dependence of the surface-cyclotron mass in accumulation layers on InSb surfaces on the electric surface field and henceforth on the surface density of electrons. The influence of the surface potential on the kp Hamiltonian is discussed in detail."
"Recently, an influence of the non-para = bolicity of the conduction band of n-type Ge on the position of the transvers-mass cyclotron resonance was observed in far-infrared experiments [1,2]. Like in a magnetopiezotransmission experiment [3] the results seemed indicate that the non-parabolicity is stronger than calculated [3]. In the calculations only two bands - the L1 conduction band and the L3, valence band - were taken into account. A more refined theory [4] including 15 bands did not yield significant corrections. So, it was difficult to understand what might cause the strong non-parabolicity as observed in the experiments. It is the purpose of this work to show that the inclusion of the kH dependence in the a.c. conductivity which has been neglected so far removes the discrepancy. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to take into account the non-parabolicity for an exact interpretation of cyclotron resonance line shapes although this effect is much smaller than in semicon ductors like n-InSb."
"For the first time gate voltage tunable narrowband far-infrared radiation from Si inversion layers is observed. The radiation is emitted by electronic transitions between the two-dimensional subbands. Population of the excited-state subband is obtained with an electric field along the channel."
"If the US Army is to operate well during inclement weather, including fog, rain, snow, and low-lying clouds, it must have a transportable system which will provide a visual image at ranges of 1-5 kilometers consistent with direct-fire weapons. The combined requirements of limited antenna aperture, small beam divergence, reasonable atmospheric absorption, and low scattering from aerosols drive us to the submillimeter portion of the spectrum."
"This paper will describe primarily the apparatus, techniques, goals and some preliminary results of the U. S. Army Missile Command submillimeter wave program. The chief goal is to fill some of the most critical data gaps identified by Hartman and Kruse [1]. The basic question is: what range and effective angular resolution can scanned submillimeter radar systems achieve, in particular, during meterological conditions of severely limited visibility. The most critical propagation issues are water vapor absorption, extinction due to aerosols, and beam degradation effects, if any, due to atmospheric turbulence. Of course the reflectance properties of cultural targets, as well as general terrain, are also of importance to the potential operating effectiveness of radar systems."
"Speckle effects and specular reflections from non-diffuse surfaces affect the ability of active submillimeter systems to Image scenes. These effects and techniques to circumvent the associated problems with respect to recognition and identification are investigated."
"The appearance of an illuminated scene at submillimeter wavelengths is determined by surface reflectivity. Reflectivities of some man-made and natural materials have been measured. The results provide some insight for evaluating possible applications of submillimeter radiation."
"This paper discusses a form of parametric interaction of radiation with matter. What seems novel about this interaction is that a change is brought about in the temporal spectrum of scattered flux of radiation that arises from physical properties of matter with which the field does not directly interact."
"Exploration and utilization of a new part of the electromagnetic spectrum requires knowledge of the propagation characteristics of that re - gion. Theoretical studies are necessary to predict what is to be expected; however, experimental propagation measurements are needed to verify the validity of the theoretical studies. Experimental measurements require that adequate apparatus for the region under study be available. While fully adequate apparatus is desirable, frequently valuable (although limited) data can be obtained from very rudimentary apparatus. Many years before the microwave region achieved adequate apparatus, Hertz through his classical experiments in 1889 generated 60 centimeter waves using a spark gap transmitter."
"Opto-acoustic spectroscopy - the technique of measuring spectral absorption characteristics of materials by calorimetric means - has come of age with the availability of tunable lasers producing reasonably high powers. Solids, liquids and gases have been studied with this technique in the range from near ultraviolet to the infrared. However, in the present review I shall restrict the discussion to the opto-acoustic spectroscopy of gaseous materials in the infrared region only."
"Relativistic Doppler effects have been proposed several years ago for conversion of centimetric electromagnetic waves to millimetric or submillimetric waves by reflection on a mirror at a velocity close to the speed of light [1]."
"Relativistic Doppler frequency shift by a relativistic mirror of intense microwaves pulses appears as an efficient process for the generation of submillimeter waves at high energy level. The ability of electron beams to be used as a relativistic mirror for microwaves has been studied experimentally in two different situations : (a) in the case of a high impedance REB device (43Ω) and (b) with a low impedance REB machine (2Ω). The REB being an interesting and very powerful microwave generator is used as well as the microwave pulse source and as the relativistic mirror."
"The topics which will be considered by the Oscillator-Amplifier Discussion Group will include suppression of spurious oscillator output, i.e. ouput at adjacent K levels, suppression of superradiance in a pulsed FIR amplifier and control of FIR pulse shape. Because of its verified high power output, emphasis will be placed on CH3F lasers; however, due to the rapidly expanding nature of FIR research transitions of other gases will also be discussed."
"Factors that play a role in the realization of Schottky-barrier diodes for use as low noise, low conversion loss elements at sub-millimeter wavelengths are discussed. Fabrication techniques including the use of plasma processing, ion-beam milling and electron beam lithography are also covered."
"Mixer performance at submillimeter wavelengths is currently limited by insufficient LO pump power. The use of subharmonically pumped mixers incorporating low capacitance diodes appears to offer a solution."
