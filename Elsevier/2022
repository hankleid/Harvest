© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The influence of the W-doping on the martensitic transformation, magnetic properties and exchange bias (EB) effect in the Ni47Mn40Sn13-xWx(x= 0, 0.5, 1, 1.25 at.%) magnetic shape memory alloys has been investigated. It is found that the W-doping causes a simultaneous reduction of both the ferromagnetic (FM) exchange coupling and enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy, leading to a decrease of the magnetic moment of the low-temperature phase and to a higher attainable EB. The magnetic memory measurements reveal the presence of a glassy magnetic ground state, which can significantly impact the reduction of magnetization and enhancement of EB in the studied bulk alloys. It is argued that the glassy magnetic ground state originates from the partial magnetic disorder resulting from the correlation between the antiferromagnetic and FM states. The results demonstrate that the doping by W instead of Sn is an efficient tool to tailor the EB effect in the Ni-Mn-Sn-based Heusler alloys, whereby they are promising for spintronic applications.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Resonant spin dynamics of topological spin textures are correlated with their topological nature, which can be employed to understand this nature. In this study, we present resonant spin dynamics of three-dimensional topological spin texture, i.e., Neel and Bloch hopfions. Using micromagnetic simulations, we stabilize Bloch and Neel hopfions with bulk and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, respectively. We identify the ground state spin configuration of both hopfions, effects of anisotropies, geometric confinements, and demagnetizing fields. To confirm topological nature, Hopf number is calculated for each spin texture. Then, we calculate the resonance frequencies and spin-wave modes of spin precessions under multiple magnetic fields. Unique resonance frequencies and specific magnetic field dependence can help to guide experimental studies to identify the three-dimensional topological spin texture of hopfions in functioning chiral magnets when imaging is not possible.Despite the extensive studies conducted in exploring friction in the aqueous environment, the mechanism of hydration friction remains not well understood. Herein, we directly probed hydration friction on mica-electrolyte interfaces with different hydrated alkali cations through a combination of three-dimensional atomic force microscopy and friction force microscopy. The atomic scale imaging of the hydration layers at the mica surface in different electrolyte solutions clearly revealed a correlation between the alkali cations and the structure of the hydration layers. Our detailed analysis showed that the hydration force was much higher at high ionic concentrations than that at low concentrations. The hydration friction coefficient was found to follow the trend K+< Na+< Li+< Cs+, which contrasts with the Hofmeister series, indicating that the hydration friction depends not only on the hydration strength of the alkali cations but also on the arrangement of the alkali cations at the interface. The results of this study provide deep insights into the origins of hydration friction, with potential implications for the development of new boundary lubrication in aqueous media.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Quantum interference and traditional domain wall effects are two common ways to manipulate the magnetism in magnetic materials. Here, we report both effects emerge in the designed graphene nanodisks simultaneously, and thus providing an accessible way to engineer the magnetism in graphene nanostructures. By adjusting the length of the armchair edges at the corners of hexagonal disk, connecting the adjacent zigzag edges, we show that the quantum interference among the zigzag edges remains robust and consequently determines the magnetic structure in the small-size systems, in analogy with the nanoribbons. More importantly, a domain-wall-like magnetic mechanism is numerically identified to dominate the larger-size disks. In particular, a magnetic state with fully spin-polarized edges achieved in a wide parameter region promises the future applications for spintronics.Supersaturation is the fundamental parameter driving crystal formation, yet its dynamics in the growth of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an approach to characterize supersaturation during classical NC growth. We develop a framework that relates noninvasive measurements of the temporal, size-dependent optical properties of growing NCs to the supersaturation dynamics underlying their growth. Using this approach, we investigate the seed-mediated growth of colloidal Au nanocubes, identifying a triphasic sequence of supersaturation dynamics: rapid monomer consumption, sustained supersaturation, and then gradual monomer depletion. These NCs undergo different shape evolutions in different phases of the supersaturation dynamics. As shown with the Au nanocubes, elucidated supersaturation profiles enable the prediction of growth profiles of NCs. We then apply these insights to rationally modulate NC shape evolutions, decreasing the yield of impurity products. Our findings reveal that the supersaturation dynamics of NC growth can be more complex than previously understood. As our approach is applicable to many types of NCs undergoing classical growth, this work presents an initial step towards more deeply interpreting the phenomena governing nanoscale crystal growth and provides insight for the rational design of NCs.Optical sensors continue to demonstrate tremendous potential across a wide range of applications due to their high versatility and low cost. This feature article will focus on a number of recent advances made in improving the performance of extraction-based optical ion sensors within our group. This includes the progress of anchored solvatochromic transduction to provide pH and sample volume independent optical responses in nanoemulsion-based sensors. A recent breakthough is in polyion sensing in biological fluids that uses a novel indirect transduction mechanism that significantly improves the selectivity of dinonylnaphthalenesulfonate-based protamine sensors and its potential applications beyond polyion sensing. The role of particle stabilizers in relation to the response of emulsified sensors is shown to be important. Current challenges in the field and possible opportunities are also discussed.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The ternary half-Heusler compounds have shown great potential for realizing new 3D topological insulators. With band gap tuning and spin orbit coupling these compounds may undergo topological phase transitions. In present work, we explore the possibility of realizing a topological insulating phase in half-Heusler family NaYO (Y= Ag, Au, and Cu). We find that for NaAgO, external strain (∼19%) along with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is required to achieve band-inversion at Γ high-symmetry point and leads to phase transition from trivial to non-trivial topological insulating phase. In case of NaAuO and NaCuO, non-trivial phase appears in their equilibrium lattice constant, hence only SOC is enough to achieve band-inversion leading to non-trivial topology. The non-centrosymmetric nature of crystal geometry leads to the formation of two twofold degenerate point nodes near the Fermi level.The photo-bolometric effect is critically important in optoelectronic structures and devices employing metallic electrodes with nanoscale features due to heating caused by the plasmonic field enhancement. One peculiar case is individual silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and their networks. Ag NW-networks exhibit excellent thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, providing a simple yet reliable alternative to common flexible transparent electrode materials used in optoelectronic devices. To date, there have been no reports on the photoresponse of Ag NWs. In this study, we show that single Ag NWs and networks of such Ag NWs possess a significant, intrinsic photoresponse, thanks to the photo-bolometric effect, as directly observed and measured using scanning photocurrent microscopy. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) created at the contact metals or plasmons created at the nanowire-metal structures cause heating at the junctions where a plasmonic field enhancement is possible. The local heating of the Ag NWs results in negative photoconductance due to the bolometric effect. Here an open-circuit response due to the plasmon-enhanced Seebeck effect was recorded at the NW-metal contact junctions. The SPP-assisted bolometric effect is found to be further enhanced by decorating the Ag NWs with Ag nanoparticles. These observations are relevant to the use of metallic nanowires in plasmonic applications in particular and in optoelectronics in general. Our findings may pave the path for plasmonics-enabled sensing without spectroscopic detection.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Achieving combination of spin and valley polarized states with topological insulating phase is pregnant to promote the fantastic integration of topological physics, spintronics and valleytronics. In this work, a spin-valley-coupled quantum spin Hall insulator (svc-QSHI) is predicted in Janus monolayer CSb1.5Bi1.5with dynamic, mechanical and thermal stabilities. Calculated results show that the CSb1.5Bi1.5is a direct band gap semiconductor with and without spin-orbit coupling, and the conduction-band minimum and valence-band maximum are at valley point. The inequivalent valleys have opposite Berry curvature and spin moment, which can produce a spin-valley Hall effect. In the center of Brillouin zone, a Rashba-type spin splitting can be observed due to missing horizontal mirror symmetry. The topological characteristic of CSb1.5Bi1.5is confirmed by theZ2invariant and topological protected conducting helical edge states. Moreover, the CSb1.5Bi1.5shows unique Rashba-splitting edge states. Both energy band gap and spin-splitting at the valley point are larger than the thermal energy of room temperature (25 meV) with generalized gradient approximation level, which is very important at room temperature for device applications. It is proved that the spin-valley-coupling and nontrivial quantum spin Hall state are robust again biaxial strain. Our work may provide a new platform to achieve integration of topological physics, spintronics and valleytronics.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The luminescent structure of thallium-doped cesium iodide (CsI:Tl) and the behavior of electrons during luminescence are studied at great length based on the conventional first-principles calculation combined with ordinary spectroscopic analysis befittingly in this work. The hybrid functionals based on a screened Coulomb potential (HSE) is used to visualize the energy band structure of the experimental sample's system, and the corresponding relationship between the transition behavior of CsI:Tl energy levels and the spectrum is studied more accurately. We show the complete energy conversion process clearly, which involves the crystal beginning to receive the energy of a photon until the moment of de-excitation. All the fluorescence process is completed by Tl+ ions that replace Cs+ ions. Our results verify and complement the previous theories and potentially provide important references for the adjustment and design of the detectors and imaging equipment in different fields.Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires have shown their potential in isolation of cancer-related biomolecules such as extracellular vesicles (EVs), RNAs, and DNAs for early diagnosis and therapeutic development of diseases. Since the function of inorganic nanowires changes depending on their morphology, previous studies have established strategies to control the morphology and have demonstrated attainment of improved properties for gas and organic compound detection, and for dye-sensitized solar cells and photoelectric conversion performance. Nevertheless, crystallinity and morphology of ZnO nanowires for capturing EVs, an important biomarker of cancer, have not yet been discussed. Here, we fabricated ZnO nanowires with different crystallinities and morphologies using an ammonia-assisted hydrothermal method, and we comprehensively analyzed the crystalline nature and oriented growth of the synthesized nanowires by X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction using high resolution transmission electron microscopy. In evaluating the performance of label-free EV capture in a microfluidic device platform, we found both the crystallinity and morphology of ZnO nanowires affected EV capture efficiency. In particular, the zinc blende phase was identified as important for crystallinity, while increasing the nanowire density in the array was important for morphology to improve EV capture performance. These results highlighted that the key physicochemical properties of the ZnO nanowires were related to the EV capture performance.© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Ion-track etching represents a highly versatile way of introducing artificial pores with diameters down into the nm-regime into polymers, which offers considerable synthetic flexibility in template-assisted nanofabrication schemes. While the mechanistic foundations of ion-track technology are well understood, its potential for creating structurally and compositionally complex nano-architectures is far from being fully tapped. In this study, we showcase different strategies to expand the synthetic repertoire of ion-track membrane templating by creating several new 1D nanostructures, namely metal nanotubes of elliptical cross-section, funnel-shaped nanotubes optionally overcoated with titania or nickel nanospike layers, and concentrical as well as stacked metal nanotube-nanowire heterostructures. These nano-architectures are obtained solely by applying different wet-chemical deposition methods (electroless plating, electrodeposition, and chemical bath deposition) to ion-track etched polycarbonate templates, whose pore geometry is modified through plastic deformation, consecutive etching steps under differing conditions, and etching steps intermitted by spatially confined deposition, providing new motifs for nanoscale replication.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.A facile two-step hydrothermal approach with post-sulfurization treatment was put forward to construct the mixed transition metal sulfide (NiCoZnS) with a high electrochemical performance. The different morphologies of NiCoZnS materials were successfully fabricated by adjusted the Ni/Co molar ratio of the NiCoZn(OH)F precursor. Moreover, the in situ phase transformation from the NiCoZn(OH)F phase to Zn0.76Co0.24S and NiCo2S4 phases and lattice defects via the S2- ion-exchange were determined by x-ray diffractometer, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, which improved electric conductivity and interfacial active sites of the NiCoZnS, and so promoted the reaction kinetics. Significantly, the urchin-like NiCoZnS1/1 prepared at the Ni/Co molar ratio of 1.0 exhibited promising electrochemical performances with high capacitance and excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, the asymmetric device (NiCoZnS//AC) using NiCoZnS1/1 as the positive electrode had excellent supercapacitor performances with an energy density of 57.8 Wh·kg-1 at a power density of 750 W·kg-1 as well as a long cycle life (79.2% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles), indicating the potential application in high-performance supercapacitors.The erythrocyte sedimentation method has been widely used to detect inflammatory diseases. However, this conventional method still has several drawbacks, such as a large blood volume (∼1 mL) and difficulty in continuous monitoring. Most importantly, image-based methods cannot quantify RBC-rich blood (blood) and RBC-free blood (diluent) simultaneously. In this study, instead of visualizing interface movement in the blood syringe, a simple method is proposed to quantify blood and diluent in microfluidic channels sequentially. The hematocrit was set to 25% to enhance RBC sedimentation and form two layers (blood and diluent) in the blood syringe. An air cavity (∼300 μL) inside the blood syringe was secured to completely remove dead volumes (∼200 μL) in fluidic paths (syringe needle and tubing). Thus, a small blood volume (Vb = 50 μL) suctioned into the blood syringe is sufficient for supplying blood and diluent in the blood channel sequentially. The relative ratio of blood resident time (RBC-to-diluent separation) was quantified using λb, which was obtained by quantifying the image intensity of blood flow. After the junction pressure (Pj) and blood volume (V) were obtained by analyzing the interface in the coflowing channel, the averaged work (Wp [Pa mm3]) was calculated and adopted to detect blood and diluent, respectively. The proposed method was then applied with various concentrations of dextran solution to detect aggregation-elevated blood. The Wp of blood and diluent exhibited substantial differences with respect to dextran solutions ranging from Cdex = 10 to Cdex = 40 mg mL-1. Moreover, λb did not exhibit substantial differences in blood with Cdex > 10 mg mL-1. The variations in λb were comparable to those of the previous method based on interface movement in the blood syringe. In conclusion, the WP could detect blood as well as diluents more effectively than λb. Furthermore, the proposed method substantially reduced the blood volume from 1 mL to 50 μL.© The Authors.Significance: Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a wide-field diffuse optical imaging technique for separately quantifying tissue reduced scattering (μs′) and absorption (μa) coefficients at multiple wavelengths, providing wide potential utility for clinical applications such as burn wound characterization and cancer detection. However, measured μs′and μacan be confounded by absorption from melanin in patients with highly pigmented skin. This issue arises because epidermal melanin is highly absorbing for visible wavelengths and standard homogeneous light-Tissue interaction models do not properly account for this complexity. Tristimulus colorimetry (which quantifies pigmentation using the L ∗ "lightness"parameter) can provide a point of comparison between μa, μs′, and skin pigmentation. Aim: We systematically compare SFDI and colorimetry parameters to quantify confounding effects of pigmentation on measured skin μs′and μa. We assess the correlation between SFDI and colorimetry parameters as a function of wavelength. Approach: μs′and μafrom the palm and ventral forearm were measured for 15 healthy subjects with a wide range of skin pigmentation levels (Fitzpatrick types I to VI) using a Reflect RS®(Modulim, Inc., Irvine, California) SFDI instrument (eight wavelengths, 471 to 851 nm). L ∗ was measured using a Chroma Meter CR-400 (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Tokyo). Linear correlation coefficients were calculated between L ∗ and μs′and between L ∗ and μaat all wavelengths. Results: For the ventral forearm, strong linear correlations between measured L ∗ and μs′values were observed at shorter wavelengths (R > 0.92 at ≤659 nm), where absorption from melanin confounded the measured μs′. These correlations were weaker for the palm (R < 0.59 at ≤659 nm), which has less melanin than the forearm. Similar relationships were observed between L ∗ and μa. Conclusions: We quantified the effects of epidermal melanin on skin μs′and μameasured with SFDI. This information may help characterize and correct pigmentation-related inaccuracies in SFDI skin measurements.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The research on low-cost, high-performance non platinum group metal (PGM) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great significance for the rapid promotion of fuel cells' practical applications. In this work, Mn-N-C catalyst with outstanding activity was prepared through using hydrogel formed by coordination of sodium alginate (SA) and Mn2+ as the precursor. During the preparation process, g-C3N4 was added to improve the surface area enrich the pore structure of catalysts, as well as to function as the nitrogen source. Compare with commercial Pt/C catalyst, the optimum Mn-N-C catalyst possesses extraordinary ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes, with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.90 V. In addition, the Mn-N-C catalyst also displays exceptional stability in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, much superior to Pt/C catalyst.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The use of conventional fabrication methods rapidly developed the performance and notable enhancements of optoelectronic devices. However, it proved challenging to develop and demonstrate stable optoelectronic devices with biodegradability and biocompatibility properties towards sustainable development and extensive applications. This study incorporates a water-soluble Cr-phycoerythrin (Cr-PE) biomaterial to observe its optical and electronic properties effects on the pristine indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO)-based photodetector. The fabricated photodetector demonstrates an extended absorption detection region, enhanced optoelectronic performance, and switchable function properties. The resulting photocurrent and responsivity of the IGZO/Cr-PE structure have increased by 5.7 and 7.1 times as compared to the pristine IGZO photodetector. It was also observed that the photodetector could operate in UV and UV-visible with enhanced optical properties by effectively adding the water-soluble Cr-PE. Also, the sensing region of IGZO photodetector becomes changeable. It exhibits switchable dual detection by alternatively dripping and removing the Cr-PE on the IGZO layer. Different measurement parameters such as detectivity, repeatability, and sensitivity are highlighted to effectively prove the advantage of including Cr-PE on the photodetector structure. This study contributes to understanding the potential functions in improving optoelectronic devices through an environmental-friendly method.© 2022 The Author(s).

Common room temperature bolometer-type infrared sensors are based on architectures in the μm range, limiting miniaturization for future highly integrated 'More than Moore' concepts. In this work, we present a first principle study on a highly scalable and CMOS compatible bolometer-type detector utilizing Ge nanowires as the thermal sensitive element. For this approach, we implemented the Ge nanowires on top of a low thermal conducting and highly absorptive membrane as a near infrared (IR) sensor element. We adopted a freestanding membrane coated with an impedance matched platinum absorber demonstrating wavelength independent absorptivity of 50% in the near to mid IR regime. The electrical characteristics of the device were measured depending on temperature and biasing conditions. A strong dependence of the resistance on the temperature was shown with a maximum temperature coefficient of resistance of -0.07 K-1 at T = 100 K. Heat transport simulations using COMSOL were used to optimize the responsivity and temporal response, which are in good agreement with the experimental results. Further, lock-in measurements were used to benchmark the bolometer device at room temperature with respect to detectivity and noise equivalent power. Finally, we demonstrated that by operating the bolometer with a network of parallel nanowires, both detectivity and noise equivalent power can be effectively improved.© The Author(s) 2022.

The detailed mechanisms are not completely understood, but extensive evidence supports an involvement of the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis, which may result from radiation-induced depletion of neural stem cells (NSCs) as well as the damage to neurogenic niches. As an important component of neurogenic niches, vascular cells interact with NSCs through different signaling mechanisms, which is similar to the characteristics of radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE). But whether RIBE is involved in neurogenesis inhibition contributed by the damaged vascular cells is unknown. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of RIBEs in non-irradiated bystander NSCs induced by irradiated bEnd.3 vascular endothelial cells in a co-culture system. The results show that compared with the NSCs cultured alone, the properties of NSCs were significantly affected after co-culture with bEnd.3 cells, and further change was induced without obvious oxidative stress and apoptosis when bEnd.3 cells were irradiated, manifesting as a reduction in the proliferation, neurosphere-forming capability and differentiation potential of NSCs. All these results suggest that the damaged vascular endothelial cells may contribute to neurogenesis inhibition via inducing RIBEs in NSCs, thus leading to RIND.© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Optically driven electronic neuromodulation devices are a novel tool in basic research and offer new prospects in medical therapeutic applications. Optimal operation of such devices requires efficient light capture and charge generation, effective electrical communication across the device's bioelectronic interface, conformal adhesion to the target tissue, and mechanical stability of the device during the lifetime of the implant - all of which can be tuned by spatial structuring of the device. We demonstrate a 3D structured opto-bioelectronic device - an organic electrolytic photocapacitor spatially designed by depositing the active device layers on an inverted micropyramid-shaped substrate. Ultrathin, transparent, and flexible micropyramid-shaped foil was fabricated by chemical vapour deposition of parylene C on silicon moulds containing arrays of inverted micropyramids, followed by a peel-off procedure. The capacitive current delivered by the devices showed a strong dependency on the underlying spatial structure. The device performance was evaluated by numerical modelling. We propose that the developed numerical model can be used as a basis for the design of future functional 3D design of opto-bioelectronic devices and electrodes.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Despite advancements in tissue engineering, the methods used to generate three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models for rapid screening and characterization studies remain time and labor intensive. Bioprinting offers an opportunity to offset these limitations by providing a scalable, high-throughput method with precise control over biomaterial scaffold and cellular deposition. However, the process of formulating bioinks can be complex in terms of balancing the mechanical integrity of a bioscaffold and viability of cells. One key factor, especially in alginate-based bioinks, is the rate of bioscaffold dissolution. It must allow cells to replace the bioscaffold with extracellular matrix (ECM), yet remain durable during extended tissue culture. This study uses a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to understand the dependencies of multiple variables involved in the formulation and processing of an alginate-based bioink. The focus of the DoE was to understand the effects of hydrogel composition on bioink durability while maintaining cell viability. Three ingredients were varied in all: alginate, nanocellulose, and fibrinogen. Their effects on the bioink were then measured with respect to extrudability, strength, and stiffness as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The DoE demonstrated that mechanical integrity increased with increasing alginate concentration. In contrast, fibrinogen and nanofibril concentration had no statistically significant effect. The optimized ink containing fibroblasts was printable using multiple nozzle sizes while also supporting fibroblast cell viability. DMA characterization further showed that the composition of the cell culture medium did not modulate the degradation rate of the hydrogel. Ultimately, the study outlines a methodology for formulating a bioink that will result in robust bioscaffolds for in vitro model development.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.In this study, we developed a flexible and transparent silver/polystyrene/polydimethylsiloxane (Ag/PS/PDMS) substrate with both high density of hot spots and satisfactory uniformity using a cost-effective approach. Via template-guided self-assembly, PS beads were arranged regularly in nanobowls of a square array on PDMS, whose surface structure was transferred from a commercial complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip. Roughness was introduced onto the PS bead surface by nitrogen plasma treatment, followed by sputtering of Ag which generated many hot spots. Differential roughness on the PS bead surface greatly influenced the morphology of the Ag/PS/PDMS substrate. A meat-ball like surface structure was formed with a plasma etching time of 5 min, whose growth mechanism was proposed based on the scanning electron microscope analysis. The high sensitivity and desirable uniformity of the meat-ball like Ag/PS/PDMS substrate were demonstrated by using crystal violet as a Raman reporter, exhibiting an enhancement factor of 2.7 × 107 and a relative standard deviation of 5.04%. Thiram of a lower concentration than the maximum residue limit on the cucumber surface could easily be detected in situ by the proposed substrate, demonstrating its great potential for in-situ food safety analysis.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper reports on the formation of moth-eye nanopillar structures on surfaces of alkali-aluminosilicate Gorilla glass substrates using a self-masking plasma etching method.

CF x induced polymers were shown to be the self-masking material during plasma etching. The nanostructures enhance transmission at wavelengths over 525 nm may be utilized for fluid-induced switchable haze. Additional functionalities associated with nanostructures may be realized such as self-cleaning, anti-fogging, and stain-resistance.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Ammonia (NH3) is an essential resource in human production and living activities, and its demand has been rising in recent years. The catalytic synthesis of NH3 from N2 under mild conditions, inspired by biological nitrogen fixation, has piqued the interest of researchers. In this paper, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the catalytic activity, mechanism, and selectivity of the TM embedded nitrogen-doped phosphorene as high-performance nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts in depth. The results show that Nb- and Mo-doped catalysts present excellent catalytic performance, with low limiting potentials of -0.41 and -0.18 V, respectively. The Mo-N3-BP catalyst, for example, not only has an extremely low overpotential (-0.02 V), but also presents superior selectivity to effectively inhibit the HER competition reaction. A deeper look into the catalytic mechanism reveals a volcano relationship between the d-band center and the catalytic activity (Mo and Nb are located near the peak of the volcano-type curve). The d-band center and charge of the metal center can be regarded as effective descriptors for NRR activity on TM embedded nitrogen-doped phosphorene electrocatalysts, which hope to serve as a guiding principle for the design of high performance NRR single-atom catalyst in the future.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper presents a pure element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) forward model for image reconstruction in 2D and 3D electrical impedance tomography (EIT) using an adaptive current injection method. In EIT systems with the adapting current injection method, both static and dynamic images can be reconstructed; however, determination of electrode contact impedances in the complete electrode model is difficult and the Gap model is used. In this paper, in the EIT forward problem a weak form functional based on the Gap model and a pure EFGM approach are developed, and in the EIT inverse problem, Jacobian matrix is computed by the EFGM, and a fast integration technique is introduced to calculate the entries of the Jacobian matrix within an adequate computation time. The influence of increasing the density of nodes at and near the electrodes with steep electric potential gradients on the accuracy of FEM and EFGM forward solutions is investigated, and the performance of the image reconstruction algorithm with the proposed fast integration technique is examined. The numerical results reveal that the proposed EFGM forward model with the fast integration technique has an efficient performance both in terms of mean relative imaging errors and computational time.Three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel microspheres have attracted increasing attention as cell culture carriers. The system of hydrogel microspheres provides great advantages for cell growth owing to its high surface-to-volume ratio and biocompatible environment. However, an integrated system that includes microsphere generation, microsphere capture and in situ culture together has not been realized yet. Here we present a multifunctional microfluidic device to accomplish the overall process including cell-laden microsphere generation, online demulsification and dynamic-culture. The microfluidic device can produce massive monodispersed alginate microspheres and allows us to immobilize the alginate microspheres and record bacterial growth. Moreover, the microspheres provide a suitable environment through the mechanical properties of soft tissues, leading to high cell viability, proliferation, activity and biocompatibility. We believe that this versatile and biocompatible platform will provide a more reliable analysis tool for tissue engineering and cell therapy.Smart windows that dynamically fine-tune the solar energy gain are promising candidates for alleviating the global energy crisis. However, current smart surfaces easily deteriorate when rain or frozen ice dwells on the surface structure, heavily hindering their applications. Here, we report an electric-powered dual-mode slippery lubricant-impregnated porous surface (DM-SLIPS) developed by integrating paraffin wax and laser-ablated polytetrafluoroethylene (LA-PTFE) along with a silver nanowire thin-film heater. Owing to its fast electrical response, DM-SLIPS can be switched to repel surface-dwelling liquids within 20 s by applying an ultra-low voltage of 6 V. Simultaneously, light irradiated on DM-SLIPS can be finely-tuned between a "lock mode" and "release mode" in response to the solidification/liquidation of paraffin. Owing to homogeneous Joule heating, the DM-SLIPS surface can remove surface-frozen ice within 4 min in situ. As a proof-of-concept, the temperature of an indoor object shielded with electric-actuated DM-SLIPS could be reversibly switched between 34 °C and 29 °C, realizing controllable solar energy input. In comparison with previously reported surfaces, the present water-repellent, ice-phobic and transparency-switchable DM-SLIPS can be more useful for thermal management in extreme climates.A chromatographic technique based on a chiral stationary phase (CSP) has been explored for enantioseparation. Herein, poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (poly(GMA)) brushes were grafted on the surface of silica gel via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), followed by the introduction of vancomycin as a chiral selector. The as-synthesized material was characterized by elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proving the formation of vancomycin-immobilized brushes. Then the resulting CSP was explored to separate 7 racemic drugs (bicalutamide, 1-benzyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid, chlorpheniramine maleate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, verapamil hydrochloride, benzoxazocine hydrochloride and isoprenaline hydrochloride) in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Several factors affecting the enantioseparation performance of the vancomycin-immobilized CSP, including the triethylamine (TEA) content in the buffer, pH value, content of organic solvent in the mobile phase, flow rate and injection volume, were mainly optimized. Under the optimal conditions, baseline separation of fluoxetine hydrochloride (RS = 2.52) was achieved, which was better than that on a commercial Chirobiotic V column, while enantioseparation of bicalutamide (RS = 1.01), chlorpheniramine maleate (RS = 0.77), 1-benzyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid (RS = 0.67), isoprenaline hydrochloride (RS = 0.73), verapamil hydrochloride (RS = 0.91) and benzoxazocine hydrochloride (RS = 1.03) was partly achieved. It was concluded that SI-ATRP is a robust way to fabricate vancomycin-based CSPs for enantioseparation.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.A memristor is defined as a non-volatile memory switching two-terminal resistor, and a memristor with digital switching characteristics is widely studied as a next-generation non-volatile memory because of its simple structure, high integration density, and low power consumption. Recently, analog memristors with gradual resistance switching (RS) characteristics have garnered great attention because of their potential to implement artificial synapses that can emulate the brain functions. Transition metal oxides are thought to be strong candidate materials for the RS. In particular, tantalum oxide (TaO x )-based memristive devices provide stable and durable switching characteristics. TaO x -based memristors utilize analog switching characteristics and have excellent durability and reliability, so they can be applied as artificial synaptic device. In this study, the characteristics of analog RS using Ta2O5-based memristive devices were investigated. The current level of the Pt/Ta2O5/Pt memristors was improved by adjusting the thickness of Ta2O5. In particular, when an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) buffer layer was added to Ta2O5 forming a Pt/ITO/Ta2O5/Pt heterostructured double-layer device, it showed more symmetrical potentiation and depression characteristics under both polarities than a single-layer device without ITO layer. The symmetrical and linear potentiation and depression characteristics are essential for the development of efficient memristor-based neuromorphic systems. Insertion of the ITO buffer layer improves linearity, symmetry, and stability of the analog RS properties of Ta2O5-based memristors to artificial synapses.Infrared spectra obtained from commercial ibuprofen tablets are categorized by using principal component analysis. A stainless steel abrasive button is used to sample the coatings and interiors of ibuprofen tablets with three different formulations. Rubbing the button wire mesh surface across tablet surfaces removes material for analysis. Small fragments are retained within mesh void spaces and larger fragments are swept away prior to analyses. Infrared spectra for tablet coatings exhibit significant differences and can be used for identification. Tablet interior compositions consisting primarily of ibuprofen from different manufacturers are more distinguishable from pre-processed spectra than from spectrum second derivatives. The speed and sensitivity afforded by this methodology suggests that rapid detection of counterfeit pharmaceuticals based on mid-infrared spectroscopy measurements of microgram quantities of material removed with a button sample holder is feasible.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Enhancement of weak Casimir forces is extremely important for their practical detection and subsequent applications in variety of scientific and technological fields. We study the lateral Casimir forces acting on the rotating particles with small radius of 50 nm as well as that with large radius of 500 nm near the hyperbolic metamaterial made of silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires. It is found that the lateral Casimir force acting on the small particle of 50 nm near hyperbolic metamaterial with appropriate filling fraction can be enhanced nearly four times comparing with that acting on the same particle near SiC bulk in the previous study. Such enhancement is caused by the coupling between the resonance mode excited by nanoparticle and the hyperbolic mode supported by hyperbolic metamaterial. The results obtained in this study provide an efficient method to enhance the interaction of nanoscale objects.A new method was developed for the determination of three triazole fungicides in environmental water samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based on ultrasonic assisted switchable hydrophilic solvent homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction. As a switchable hydrophilic solvent, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA) does not require a dispersant or centrifugation. Ultrasound assistance is helpful to speed up the extraction of target compounds and can reduce the pretreatment time. The entire pretreatment process of this method only takes 5 minutes. Using the Box-Behnken design as the means of optimization, optimal extraction conditions were obtained through a mathematical model. Good linearity was obtained in the range of 5-500 μg L-1, and the correlation coefficient of target compounds was greater than 0.999. The matrix spiked recoveries were between 81.3% and 111.1% and the detection limit was between 0.46 and 0.99 μg L-1. Intraday relative standard deviation (n = 3) was 13.0-13.9% at 100 μg L-1. Finally, it was concluded that the method is a rapid, efficient and simple method for the analysis of triazole fungicides in water.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Few-layer graphene has been widely regarded as an efficient filter for gas separation, but the effect of the layer number on the gas permeation process is still unclear. To explore the layer number effect, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the gas permeation through a nanopore within the few-layer graphene. Our numerical simulations show that the permeation constant decreases with increasing layer number, which is analyzed based on the macroscopic Kennard empirical model. The macroscopic model is in good agreement with the numerical result in the limit of large layer number, but there are obvious deviations for the medium layer number. We generalize the macroscopic model by considering the nanoscale effect from the surface morphology of the nanoscale pore, which can well describe the layer number dependence for the gas permeation constant in the full range. These results provide valuable information for the application of few-layer graphene in the gas permeation field.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryAlternative interpretations of the experimental results given in the Communication of Petuya et al.1 are presented. There is evidence that under certain conditions, ammonia can be incorporated into clathrate hydrate cages.The purpose of this work was to apply an electrochemical sensor modified with a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and carbon black (CB) for 17β-estradiol (E2) detection in river water samples. The synthesized MIP was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The modification of the electrode with the MIP and CB contributed to increased sensitivity, an increase of over 173% in relation to that of the bare electrode. The experimental parameters, amount of modifiers, pH and possible interfering species were evaluated. The method showed linearity from 0.10 to 23.0 μmol L-1 and detection and quantification limits of 0.03 and 0.10 μmol L-1, respectively. The application of the developed sensor was considered simple, resulting in a fast, low operating cost method, with recovery values between 103 and 105%.© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Ionic liquids (ILs) supported on oxide surfaces are being investigated for numerous applications including catalysis, batteries, capacitors, transistors, lubricants, solar cells, corrosion inhibitors, nanoparticle synthesis and biomedical applications. The study of ILs with oxide surfaces presents challenges both experimentally and computationally. The interaction between ILs and oxide surfaces can be rather complex, with defects in the oxide surface playing a key role in the adsorption behaviour and resulting electronic properties. The choice of the cation/anion pair is also important and can influence molecular ordering and electronic properties at the interface. These controllable interfacial behaviours make ionic liquid/oxide systems desirable for a number of different technological applications as well as being utilised for nanoparticle synthesis. This topical review aims to bring together recent experimental and theoretical work on the interaction of ILs with oxide surfaces, including TiO2, ZnO, Al2O3, SnO2 and transition metal oxides. It focusses on the behaviour of ILs at model single crystal surfaces, the interaction between ILs and nanoparticulate oxides, and their performance in prototype devices.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Objective.Research of surface electromyography (sEMG) signal modeling and feature extraction is important in human motion intention recognition, prosthesis and exoskeleton robots. However, the existing methods mostly use the signal segmentation processing method rather than the point-to-point signal processing method, and lack physiological mechanism support.Approach. In this study, a real-time sEMG signal modeling and separation method is developed based on oscillatory theory. On this basis, an sEMG signal feature extraction method is constructed, and an ensemble learning method is combined to achieve real-time human hand motion intention recognition.Main results.The experimental results show that the average root mean square difference value of the sEMG signal modeling is 0.3838 ± 0.0591, and the average accuracy of human hand motion intention recognition is 96.03 ± 1.74%. On a computer with Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-8250U CPU running Matlab 2016Rb, the execution time for the sEMG signal with an actual duration of 2 s is 0.66 s.Significance. Compared with several existing methods, the proposed method has better modeling accuracy, motion intention recognition accuracy and real-time performance. The method developed in this study may provide a new perspective on sEMG modeling and feature extraction for hand movement classification.Creative Commons Attribution license.Objective.Brachial plexus injuries (BPIs) result in serious dysfunction, especially brachial plexus defects which are currently treated using autologous nerve graft (autograft) transplantation. With the development of tissue engineering, tissue engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) have emerged as promising alternatives to autografts but have not yet been widely applied to the treatment of BPIs. Herein, we developed a TENG modified with extracellular matrix generated by skin-derived precursor Schwann cells (SKP-SCs) and expand its application in upper brachial plexus defects in rats.Approach.SKP-SCs were co-cultured with chitosan neural conduits or silk fibres and subjected to decellularization treatment. Ten bundles of silk fibres (five fibres per bundle) were placed into a conduit to obtain the TENG, which was used to bridge an 8 mm gap in the upper brachial plexus. The efficacy of this treatment was examined for TENG-, autograft- and scaffold-treated groups at several times after surgery using immunochemical staining, behavioural tests, electrophysiological measurements, and electron microscopy.Main results.Histological analysis conducted two weeks after surgery showed that compared to scaffold bridging, TENG treatment enhanced the growth of regenerating axons. Behavioural tests conducted four weeks after surgery showed that TENG-treated rats performed similarly to autograft-treated ones, with a significant improvement observed in both cases compared with the scaffold treatment group. Electrophysiological and retrograde tracing characterizations revealed that the target muscles were reinnervated in both TENG and autograft groups, while transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining showed the occurrence of the superior myelination of regenerated axons in these groups.Significance.Treatment with the developed TENG allows the effective bridging of proximal nerve defects in the upper extremities, and the obtained results provide a theoretical basis for clinical transformation to expand the application scope of TENGs.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryOur recent Communication suggested that ammonia in aqueous solution may preferentially destabilize large cages in methane clathrate hydrates. A Comment favored ammonia incorporation instead, but it did not accurately describe our proposed mechanism and relied primarily on studies conducted in different chemical systems and/or which used other preparation methods.Moisture content is a critical variable for the harvesting, processing, storing and marketing of cereal grains, oilseeds and legumes. Efficient and accurate determination of grain moisture content even with advanced nondestructive techniques, remains a challenge due to complex water-retaining biological structures and hierarchical composition and geometry of grains that affect measurement interpretation and require specific grain-dependent calibration. We review (1) the primary factors affecting permittivity measurements used in practice for inferring moisture content in grains; (2) develop novel methods for estimating critical parameters for permittivity modeling including packing density, porosity, water binding surface area and water phase permittivity and (3) represent the permittivity of packs of grains using dielectric mixture theory as a function of moisture content applied to high moisture corn (as a model grain). Grain permittivity measurements are affected by their free and bound water contents, chemical composition, temperature, constituent shape, phase configuration and measurement frequency. A large fraction of grain water is bound exhibiting reduced permittivity compared to that of free water. The reduced mixture permittivity and attributed to hydrophilic surfaces in starches, proteins and other high surface area grain constituents. The hierarchal grain structure (i.e., kernel, starch grain, lamella, molecule) and the different constituents influence permittivity measurements due to their layering, geometry (i.e., kernel or starch grain), configuration and water-binding surface area. Dielectric mixture theory offers a physically-based approach for modeling permittivity of agricultural grains and similar granular media.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have received ever-increasing attention and in-depth exploration in multifarious fields on account of their superior mass transfer ability and abundant catalytic-active sites. Especially, the amorphous 2D nanomaterials feature unique properties distinct from atomic crystalline materials. However, the synthesis of high-quality and large-sized amorphous 2D nanomaterials encounters a big challenge. Here, a general and facile synthetic strategy for a series of 2D amorphous metal and nonmetallic oxides nanosheets, including SiO2, AlOOH, ZrO2 and TiO2 nanosheets, is reported. The versatile 2D amorphous nanomaterials are fabricated via manipulating the surface energy of relevant metal alkoxide precursors with liquid feature and controlling the related synthesis parameters to form solid 2D amorphous nanosheets by in situ hydrolysis and condensation of precursors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the molecular adsorption mechanism of wetting process of precursor infiltrated on solid NaCl substrate, which attributes to the strong interaction between Na-O atom pairs from NaCl and metal alkoxides respectively. Furthermore, taking the 2D Fe-ZrO2 nanomaterials as the catalyst, the excellent catalytic performance for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation illustrates that these 2D nanomaterials prepared by this method have the characteristics of easy functionalization. This work provides an efficient strategy for nanomaterials functionalization during 2D nanosheets synthetic process and further being applied in catalysis-related field and beyond.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryNuclear spin singlet states are often found to allow long-lived storage of nuclear magnetization, which can form the basis of novel applications in spectroscopy, imaging, and in studies of dynamic processes. Precisely how long such polarization remains intact, and which factors affect its lifetime is often difficult to determine and predict. We present a combined experimental/computational study to demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio calculations can be used to fully account for the experimentally observed proton singlet lifetimes in ethyl-d5-propyl-d7-maleate in deuterated chloroform as solvent. The correspondence between experiment and simulations is achieved without adjustable parameters. These studies highlight the importance of considering unusual and difficult-to-control mechanisms, such as dipolar couplings to low-gamma solvent nuclei, and to residual paramagnetic species, which often can represent lifetime limiting factors. These results also point to the power of molecular dynamics simulations to provide insights into little-known NMR relaxation mechanisms.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryLow-cost and high-abundance Cu nanostructures are potential near-infrared (NIR) surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) photosensitizers for carbon nitride (C3N4) photocatalysts, but their low activity and stability need to be improved. In this article, doping S into C3N4 (S-C3N4) creates anchoring sites for photo-deposited Cu nanoparticles (NPs), and the spontaneous construction of S-Cu bonds is realized between S-C3N4 and Cu NPs. The optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 1.64 mmol g−1 h−1 is obtained for S-C3N4-Cu, which is 5.5, 4.6 and 1.7 times that of pure C3N4, S-C3N4 and S-C3N4-Cu, respectively. With further loading of a Pt co-catalyst to confirm the role of Cu NPs and improve the photocatalytic activity of the SCN-Cu, the photocatalytic rate can reach up to 14.34 mmol g−1 h−1. Due to the NIR SPR effect of Cu NPs, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of S-C3N4-Cu at 600 and 765 nm is 2.02% and 0.47%, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of S-C3N4-Cu compared with C3N4-Cu is mainly due to the introduced S-Cu bonds that improve the injection rate of hot electrons. This solution provides a simple and efficient interface optimization strategy for the construction of efficient NIR-driven photocatalysts.Copyright © 2022 by ASME.A comprehensive characterization of the three-dimensional (3D) vascular network of the optic nerve head (ONH) is critical to understanding eye physiology and pathology. Current in vivo imaging technologies, however, do not have simultaneous high spatial resolution and imaging depth to resolve the small vessels deep within the ONH. We describe a workflow for the 3D reconstruction and quantitative morphological analysis of the ONH vasculature. The vessels of a normal monkey ONH were perfusion labeled. Serial cryosections of the ONH were imaged using fluorescence microscopy (FM) and instant polarized light microscopy (IPOL) to visualize the labeled vessels and label-free collagen, respectively. The IPOL images were registered and used to form a stack of FM images from which the vessels were segmented and skeletonized to reconstruct the 3D vascular network. The network consisted of 12,966 vessel segments, 7989 branching points, and 1100 terminal points at the boundaries. For each vessel segment, we measured its length, tortuosity, inclination (θ), and polar orientation (φ). The length followed a lognormal distribution, whereas the distribution of the tortuosity followed an exponential decay. The vessels were mainly oriented toward the coronal plane (θ = 90 deg). For orientation, there were nearly as many vessels aligned circumferentially (φ = 90 deg) and radially (φ = 0 deg). Our results demonstrate the workflow for 3D eye-specific reconstruction and quantification of the monkey ONH vascular network. This is a critical first step to analyze the blood flow and oxygenation within the ONH, which will help understand the role of vascular dysfunction in glaucoma.© 2022 Du et al.Introduction: Cancerous tumors are still a major disease that threatens human life, with tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) being one of the main reasons for the failure of chemotherapy. Thus, reversing tumor MDR has become a research focus of medical scientists. Methods: Here, a reduction-sensitive polymer prodrug micelle, mPEG-DCA-SS-PTX (PDSP), was manufactured with a new polymer inhibitor of drug resistance as a carrier to overcome MDR and improve the anti-tumor effect of PTX. Results: The PDSP micelles display good stability, double-responsive drug release, and excellent biocompatibility. The PDSP micelles reduced the cytotoxicity of PTX to normal HL-7702 cells and enhanced that to SMMC-7721 and MCF-7 cells in vitro. Improved sensitivity of A549/ADR to PDSP was also observed in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo experiments show reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced therapeutic efficacy of PTX to H22 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: This work proves that the reduction-sensitive polymer prodrug micelles carried by the new polymer inhibitor can be used as an alternative delivery system to target tumors and reverse MDR for paclitaxel and other tumor-resistant drugs.© 2022 Wang et al.Purpose: A rapid, convenient, cost-effective in-home test method for identifying heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) in plasma and blood by a lateral-flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) was developed. Methods: SeNPs were synthesized by using L-ascorbic acid to reduce seleninic acid at room temperature and conjugated with an anti-H-FABP monoclonal antibody. The limit of detection, specificity, and stability were measured, and clinical samples were analyzed. Results: The SeNPs were spherical with a diameter of 39.48 ± 3.72 nm and were conjugated successfully with an anti-H-FABP antibody, resulting in a total diameter of 46.52 ± 2.95 nm. The kit was designed for the determination of H-FABP in plasma specimens and whole blood specimens. The limit of detection was 1 ng/mL in plasma and blood, and the results could be determined within 10 min. No cross-reaction occurred with cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase-MB or myoglobin. The kits were stored at 40 °C for up to 30 days without significant loss of activity. The sensitivity was determined to be 100%, the specificity 96.67%, and the overall coincidence rate 97.83%. Conclusion: This SeNP assay kit can conveniently, rapidly, and sensitively detect H-FABP in plasma or blood with a readout of a simple color change visible to the naked eye with no special device, and can be used as an auxiliary means for the early screening of AMI. Clinical Trial Registration: Plasma and blood samples were used under approval from the Experimental Animal Ethics committee of the Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering, Henan University. The clinical trial registration number was HUSOM-2019-047.It has been demonstrated that RNA molecules-mRNA, siRNA, microRNA, and sgRNA-regulate cancer-specific genes, and therefore, RNA-based therapeutics can suppress tumor progression and metastasis by selectively upregulating and silencing these genes. However, the innate defense mechanisms (e.g., exonucleases and RNases) involving the human immune system catalyze the degradation of exogenous RNAs. Thus, nonviral nanoparticles have been employed to deliver therapeutic RNAs for effective cancer gene therapy. In this minireview, we highlight efforts in the past decade to deliver therapeutic RNAs for cancer therapy using novel nanoparticles. Specifically, we review nanoparticles, including lipid, polymer, inorganic, and biomimetic materials, which have been employed to deliver therapeutic RNAs and evoke tumor suppressing responses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and considerations that may accelerate the clinical translation of nanotechnology-mediated RNA therapy.© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Impact towards the tuneable characteristics of bioactive glasses (BAGs) has been explored; as there is no root canal sealant till date with ideal characteristics competent enough to manoeuvre the perplexing root canal architecture. Combeite, calcite and traces of cuprorivaite crystalline phases were validated for material formation, in which Cu 2P (XPS) peak authenticating the presence of copper in bioglass network (Cu-BAG). Spherical and platelet-like morphologies were observed and the grain size of Cu-BAG (∼100 nm) was lesser as compared to BAG (∼1 µm). These particle distributions impacted the porosity, and dominant non-bridging oxygens in Cu-BAG influences ionic dissolution, which subsequently enhanced the mineralization. These bioactive materials were loaded with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, corresponding organic moieties was confirmed through Fourier transform infra-red. These drugs loaded bioactive materials exhibited tremendous anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial behaviour with better sealing ability. Drug loaded bioglass paste filled in biomechanically prepared root canal was estimated for sealing potential, mineralization, micro leakage, and fracture resistance properties. Hydroxyl apatite growth was noted on the sealants, flower like protuberance confirmed the sealing potential of the prepared material. Bioglass exhibited promising characteristics required in a root canal sealant. This investigation is a step further towards tailoring the properties of bioactive materials as promising candidates in root canal obturation and thereof.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryElemental two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted extraordinary interest compared with other 2D materials over the past few years. Fifteen elements from group IIIA to VIA have been discussed experimentally or theoretically for the formation of 2D monolayers, and the remaining few elements still need to be identified. Here, using first-principles calculations within density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMDs), we demonstrated that polonium can form stable 2D monolayers (MLs) with a 1T-MoS2-like structure. The band structure calculations revealed that polonium monolayers possess strong semiconducting properties with a band gap of ∼0.9 eV, and such semiconducting properties can well sustain up to a thickness of 4 MLs with a bandgap of ∼0.1 eV. We also found that polonium monolayers can be achieved through a spontaneous phase transition of ultrathin films with magic thicknesses, resulting in a weaker van der Waals interaction of ∼32 meV Å−2 between each three atomic layers. Also, the underlying physics comes from layered Peierls-like distortion driven by strong quantum size effects. Based on these intriguing findings, a suitable substrate on which the polonium monolayer can be grown through an epitaxial growth technique is proposed for further experiments. Our work not only extends completely the puzzle of elemental 2D monolayer materials from group IIIA to VIA, but also presents a new formation mechanism of 2D materials beyond the database of bulk materials with layered van der Waals interactions.Powered ankle exoskeletons (PAEs) are robotic devices developed for gait assistance, rehabilitation, and augmentation. To fulfil their purposes, PAEs vastly rely heavily on their sensor systems. Human-machine interface sensors collect the biomechanical signals from the human user to inform the higher level of the control hierarchy about the user's locomotion intention and requirement, whereas machine-machine interface sensors monitor the output of the actuation unit to ensure precise tracking of the high-level control commands via the low-level control scheme. The current article aims to provide a comprehensive review of how wearable sensor technology has contributed to the actuation and control of the PAEs developed over the past two decades. The control schemes and actuation principles employed in the reviewed PAEs, as well as their interaction with the integrated sensor systems, are investigated in this review. Further, the role of wearable sensors in overcoming the main challenges in developing fully autonomous portable PAEs is discussed. Finally, a brief discussion on how the recent technology advancements in wearable sensors, including environment-machine interface sensors, could promote the future generation of fully autonomous portable PAEs is provided.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryFree base 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxylatophenyl)porphyrin stands for the class of powerful porphyrin photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation and light-harvesting. The atomic level selectivity of dynamic UV pump - N K-edge probe X-ray absorption spectroscopy in combination with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) gives direct access to the crucial excited molecular states within the unusual relaxation pathway. The efficient intersystem crossing, that is El-Sayed forbidden and not facilitated by a heavy atom is confirmed to be the result of the long singlet excited state lifetime (Qx 4.9 ns) and thermal effects. Overall, the interplay of stabilization by conservation of angular momenta and vibronic relaxation drive the de-excitation in these chromophores.© 2022 Ashrafizadeh et al.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is among the chronic metabolic disorders that its incidence rate has shown an increase in developed and wealthy countries due to lifestyle and obesity. The treatment of DM has always been of interest, and significant effort has been made in this field. Exosomes belong to extracellular vesicles with nanosized features (30-150 nm) that are involved in cell-to-cell communication and preserving homeostasis. The function of exosomes is different based on their cargo, and they may contain lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The present review focuses on the application of exosomes in the treatment of DM; both glucose and lipid levels are significantly affected by exosomes, and these nanostructures enhance lipid metabolism and decrease its deposition. Furthermore, exosomes promote glucose metabolism and affect the level of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters in DM. Type I DM results from the destruction of β cells in the pancreas, and exosomes can be employed to ameliorate apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in these cells. The exosomes have dual functions in mediating insulin resistance/sensitivity, and M1 macrophage-derived exosomes inhibit insulin secretion. The exosomes may contain miRNAs, and by transferring among cells, they can regulate various molecular pathways such as AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and β-catenin to affect DM progression. Noteworthy, exosomes are present in different body fluids such as blood circulation, and they can be employed as biomarkers for the diagnosis of diabetic patients. Future studies should focus on engineering exosomes derived from sources such as mesenchymal stem cells to treat DM as a novel strategy.In this study, a novel Multivariable Adaptive Neural Network Controller (MANNC) is developed for coupled model-free n-input n-output systems. The learning algorithm of the proposed controller does not rely on the model of a system and uses only the history of the system inputs and outputs. The system is considered as a 'black box' with no pre-knowledge of its internal structure. By online monitoring and possessing the system inputs and outputs, the parameters of the controller are adjusted. Using the accumulated gradient of the system error along with the Lyapunov stability analysis, the weights' adjustment convergence of the controller can be observed, and an optimal training number of the controller can be selected. The Lyapunov stability of the system is checked during the entire weight training process to enable the controller to handle any possible nonlinearities of the system. The effectiveness of the MANNC in controlling nonlinear square multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is demonstrated via three simulation studies covering the cases of a time-invariant nonlinear MIMO system, a time-variant nonlinear MIMO system, and a hybrid MIMO system, respectively. In each case, the performance of the MANNC is compared with that of a properly selected existing counterpart. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MANNC is capable of controlling various types of square MIMO systems with much improved performance over its existing counterpart. The unique properties of the MANNC will make it a suitable candidate for many industrial applications.© 2022 Si et al.Purpose: Osteosarcoma is considered as the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, and the treatments including chemotherapy and surgery were far from satisfactory. Localized tumor treatments by hydrogels incorporating combined chemotherapeutic drugs have recently emerged as superior approaches for enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced systemic toxicity. Methods: A novel injectable thermosensitive poly (lactide-co- glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) triblock copolymer hydrogel containing doxorubicin and cisplatin for the localized chemotherapy of osteosarcoma were synthesized and characterized. The in vitro drug release properties of the drugs-loaded hydrogels were investigated. To study the anti-tumor efficacy of hydrogels depots in vitro, the cytotoxicity and apoptosis rate against Saos-2 and MG-63 cells were evaluated by MTT, Annexin V and PCR methods. The in vivo synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of the multi-drugs co-loaded hydrogels was investigated by human osteosarcoma xenografts. Additionally, the systemic toxic side effects were evaluated by ex vivo histological analysis of the major organs of the mice. Results: The PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer solution underwent a sol-gel transition at appropriate temperature and degraded in the PBS, presenting a friendly biocompatibility in vitro. The in vitro cell viability tests demonstrated that DOX and CDDP co-loaded hydrogels exhibited synergistic anti-proliferation effect, due to the sustained release of drugs from the drugs-loaded hydrogel. The treatment with DOX and CDDP co-loaded hydrogel led to the highest efficiency in inhibiting the tumor growth, enhanced tumor necrosis rate and increased regulation of the apoptosis-related gene expressions, indicating a synergistic anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Additionally, ex vivo histological analysis of the nude mice exhibited low systemic toxicity. Conclusion: The combination treatment of osteosarcoma by localized, sustained co-delivery of DOX and CDDP by PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel may serve as a promising strategy for efficient clinical treatment of osteosarcoma.Copyright © 2022 by ASME.The lumbar facet capsular ligament, which surrounds and limits the motion of each facet joint in the lumbar spine, has been recognized as being mechanically significant and has been the subject of multiple mechanical characterization studies in the past. Those studies, however, were performed on isolated tissue samples and thus could not assess the mechanical state of the ligament in vivo, where the constraints of attachment to rigid bone and the force of the joint pressure lead to nonzero strain even when the spine is not loaded. In this work, we quantified these two effects using cadaveric lumbar spines (five spines, 20 total facet joints harvested from L2 to L5). The effect of joint pressure was measured by injecting saline into the joint space and tracking the 3D capsule surface motion via digital image correlation, and the prestrain due to attachment was measured by dissecting a large section of the tissue from the bone and by tracking the motion between the on-bone and free states. We measured joint pressures of roughly 15-40 kPa and local first principal strains of up to 25-50% when 0.3 mL of saline was injected into the joint space; the subsequent increase in pressure and strain were more modest for further increases in injection volume, possibly due to leakage of fluid from the joint. The largest stretches were in the bone-to-bone direction in the portions of the ligament spanning the joint space. When the ligament was released from the vertebrae, it shrank by an average of 4-5%, with local maximum (negative) principal strain values of up to 30%, on average. Based on these measurements and previous tests on isolated lumbar facet capsular ligaments, we conclude that the normal in vivo state of the facet capsular ligament is in tension, and that the collagen in the ligament is likely uncrimped even when the spine is not loaded.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe potential energy profiles of three proton transfer-involved product channels for the reactions of Y−(H2O)1,2 + CH3I (Y = F, Cl, Br, I) were characterized using the B97-1/ECP/d method. These three channels include the (1) PTCH3 product channel that transfers a proton from methyl to nucleophile, (2) HO−-induced nucleophilic substitution (HO−-SN2) product channel, and (3) oxide ion substitution (OIS) product channel that gives CH3O− and HY products. The reaction enthalpies and barrier heights follow the order OIS > PTCH3 > HO−-SN2 > Y−-SN2, and thus HO−-SN2 can compete with the most favored Y−-SN2 product channel under singly-/doubly-hydrated conditions, while the PTCH3 channel only occurs under high collision energy and the OIS channel is the least probable. All product channels share the same pre-reaction complex, Y−(H2O)n-CH3I, in the entrance of the potential energy profile, signifying the importance of the pre-reaction complex. For HO−/Y−-SN2 channels, we considered front-side attack, back-side attack, and halogen-bonded complex mechanisms. Incremental hydration increases the barriers of both HO−/Y−-SN2 channels as well as their barrier difference, implying that the HO−-SN2 channel becomes less important when further hydrated. Varying the nucleophile Y− from F− to I− also increases the barrier heights and barrier difference, which correlates with the proton affinity of the nucleophiles. Energy decomposition analyses show that both the orbital interaction energy and structural deformation energy of the transition states determine the SN2 barrier change trend with incremental hydration and varying Y−. In brief, this work computes the comprehensive potential energy surfaces of the HO−-SN2 and PTCH3 channels and shows how proton transfer affects the microsolvated Y−(H2O)1,2 + CH3I reaction by competing with the traditional Y−-SN2 channel.© 2022 Yang et al.Purpose: Tumor-free surgical margin is crucial but challenging in breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Fluorescence imaging is a promising strategy for surgical navigation that can reliably assist the surgeon with visualization Of the tumor in real-time. Notably, finding an optimized fluorescent probe has been a challenging research topic. Herein, we developed a novel near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe based on tailored Hepatitis B Core virus-like protein (HBc VLP) and presented the preclinical imaging-guided surgery. Methods: The RGD-HBc160 VLP was synthesized by genetic engineering followed encapsulation of ICG via disassembly-reassembly. The applicability of the probe was tested for cell and tissue binding capacities through cell-based plate assays, xenograft mice model, and MMTV-PyVT mammary tumor transgenic mice. Subsequently, the efficacy of RGD-HBc160/ICG-guided surgery was evaluated in an infiltrative tumor-bearing mouse model. The protein-induced body's immune response was further assessed. Results: The prepared RGD-HBc160/ICG showed outstanding integrin αvβ3 targeting ability in vitro and in vivo. After intravenous administration of probe, the fluorescence guidance facilitated more complete tumor resection and improved overall survival Of the infiltrative tumor-bearing mice. The probe also showed the excellent capability to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tissues in the mammary tumor transgenic mice. Interestingly, the ingenious tailoring of HBc VLP could not only endow its tumor-targeting ability towards integrin αvβ3 but also significantly reduce the humoral and cellular immune response. Conclusion: The RGD-HBc160/ICG holds promise as an effective tool to delineate tumor margin. These results have translational potential to achieve margin-negative resection and improve the stratification of patients for a potentially curative.Access to and extensive use of fluorometric analyses is limited, despite its extensive utility in environmental transport and fate. Wide-spread application of fluorescent tracers has been limited by the prohibitive costs of research-grade equipment and logistical constraints of sampling, due to the need for high spatial resolutions and access to remote locations over long timescales. Recently, low-cost alternatives to research-grade equipment have been found to produce comparable data at a small fraction of the price for commercial equipment. Here, we prototyped and benchmarked performance of a variety of fluorometer components against commercial units, including performance as a function of tracer concentration, turbidity, and temperature, all of which are known to impact fluorometer performance. While component performance was found to be comparable to the commercial units tested, the best configuration tested obtained a functional resolution of 0.1 ppb, a working concentration range of 0.1 to &gt;300 ppb, and a cost of USD 59.13.© 2022 Wang et al.Purpose: Transplantation of stem cells to remodel the trabecular meshwork (TM) has become a new option for restoring aqueous humor dynamics and intraocular pressure homeostasis in glaucoma. In this study, we aimed to design a nanoparticle to label induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived TM and improve the delivery accuracy and in vivo tracking efficiency. Methods: PLGA-SPIO-Cypate (PSC) NPs were designed with polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PLGA) polymers as the backbone, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles, and near-infrared (NIR) dye cypate. In vitro assessment of cytotoxicity, iron content after NPs labeling, and the dual-model monitor was performed on mouse iPSC-derived TM (miPSC-TM) cells, as well as immortalized and primary human TM cells. Cell function after labeling, the delivery accuracy, in vivo tracking efficiency, and its effect on lowering IOP were evaluated following miPSC-TM transplantation in mice. Results: Initial in vitro experiments showed that a single-time nanoparticles incubation was sufficient to label iPSC-derived TM and was not related to any change in both cell viability and fate. Subsequent in vivo evaluation revealed that the use of this nanoparticle not only improves the delivery accuracy of the transplanted cells in live animals but also benefits the dual-model tracking in the long term. More importantly, the use of the magnet triggers a temporary enhancement in the effectiveness of cell-based therapy in alleviating the pathologies associated with glaucoma. Conclusion: This study provided a promising approach for enhancing both the delivery and in vivo tracking efficiency of the transplanted cells, which facilitates the clinical translation of stem cell-based therapy for glaucoma.© 2022 Tian et al.Purpose: VicR is the essential response regulator related to the synthesis of exopolysaccharide (EPS) - one of the main cariogenic factors of S. mutans. An antisense vicR RNA (ASvicR) could bind to vicR mRNA, hindering the transcription and translation of the vicR gene. We had constructed a recombinant plasmid containing the ASvicR sequence (plasmid-ASvicR) and proved that it could reduce EPS synthesis, biofilm formation, and cariogenicity. However, the recombinant plasmids are supposed to be protected from enzymatic degradation and possess higher transformation efficiency. The principal objective of the present research was to construct an appropriate vector that can carry and protect the plasmid-ASvicR and investigate the effects of the carried plasmids on the cariogenicity of the S. mutans. Methods: Aminated dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs-NH2) were synthesized and characterized. The ability of DMSNs-NH2 to carry and preserve the plasmid-ASvicR (DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR) was proved by the loading curve, agarose electrophoresis, DNase I digestion assays, and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping. Transformation assays demonstrated whether the plasmid could enter S. mutans. The effect of DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR on the 12-hour and 24-hour biofilms of S. mutans was evaluated by biofilm formation experiments and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The cytotoxicity of DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR was assessed by CCK-8 and live/dead staining assays. The regulation of DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR on the cariogenicity of S. mutans was also evaluated in vivo. Results: DMSNs-NH2 could load approximately 92% of plasmid-ASvicR at a mass ratio of 80 and protect most of plasmid-ASvicR from degradation by DNase I. The plasmid-ASvicR loaded on DMSNs-NH2 could be transformed into S. mutans, which down-regulated the expression of the vicR gene, reducing EPS synthesis and biofilm organization of S. mutans. DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR exhibited favorable biocompatibility, laying a foundation for its subsequent biomedical application. In addition, DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR led to decreased caries in vivo. Conclusion: DMSNs-NH2 is a suitable vector of plasmid-ASvicR, and DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR can inhibit biofilm formation, reducing the cariogenicity of S. mutans. These findings reveal that DMSNs-NH2-ASvicR is a promising agent for preventing and treating dental caries.© 2022 American Chemical Society.A giant enhancement of nearly 100 times is seen in triethylamine response through Ti-Zr-Cr-V-Ni high-entropy alloy nanoparticle (HEA NP)-induced fermi energy control of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets. These Laves-phase HEA NP-decorated MoS2 samples are synthesized using cryomilling followed by 30 h of sonication. The prolonged sonication results in well-exfoliated MoS2 with fairly small (∼10-20 nm) HEA NPs anchored due to cryomilling confirmed by extensive microscopic and spectroscopic examinations. The presence of HEA NPs leads to reduction in edge oxidation of MoS2 as seen from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, this edge state reduction causes strong Fermi level pinning, which is commonly observed in layered MoS2 with bulk metal electrodes. This leads to target gas-specific carrier-type response and selective oxidation of TEA vapors due to highly catalytically active metals. The resulting composite (MoS2 + NPs) exhibits high response (380% for 2000 ppm TEA vapors) along with selectivity toward TEA at 50 °C. The cross-sensitivity of the composite to other volatile organic compounds and NH3, CO, and H2 has been very minimal. Thus, the highly selective catalytic activity of metal alloy NPs and their Fermi energy control has been proposed as the prime factors for observed large sensitivity and selective response of MoS2 + NP nanocomposites.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Different types of phytohormones viz., indole acetic acid, gibberellins, etc., are often synthesized by endophytic microbes that directly enhance plant health. Investigations in the metabolite pool of endophytes revealed the production of several metabolites and peptides as bioactive compounds involved in plant disease defense. Important Solanaceous vegetables like tomato, eggplant, capsicum, etc., are infected by various pathogens (viz., Fusarium spp., Ralstonia solanacearum, Botrytis cinerea, etc.,) occurring huge losses. Association of endophyte suppresses these pathogens by various mechanisms marking it as a biocontrol agent. This chapter summarizes the comprehensive information on research findings of endophytic metabolites and peptides as plant growth promoters and disease management agents plants with a case study on solanaceous crop tomato.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Organic amending can improve soil chemical, physical and biological traits and also can inconsistently suppress nematode damage. Amendment can also be a solution for recycling huge amounts of organic wastes produced in urban communities and agro-industrial processes. The common types of organic matters used in agriculture are animal manures, oil cakes, chitinous material, urban organic waste, plant extracts, agro-industrial waste, crop residues, composts, peats, green manures and processing residues. Suppression typically ascribes to either one or both direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include those that reduce phytonematode populations by releasing nematicidal, nematistatic or allelochemical compounds from organic matters or during their decomposition. Indirect mechanisms suppress nematodes by increasing the population and diversity of antagonistic microbiota increasing the tolerance or resistance level of plants; and improving soil properties. Quick suppression usually occurs following releasing toxic molecules while prolonged effects relate to enhancement in populations of antagonist microbita. Within an organically amended soil, increase in populations of phytonematodes occasionally happens when the environmental conditions change in favor of parasitic nematode. In this chapter, the effects of different types of organic matters on important groups of phytonematodes are reviewed. As well, the recent advances in comprehending the mechanisms by which soil organic amendment influence on phytonematodes are elucidated.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, biofortification potential of legumes remains underexploited. The enhancement of legume nutritional composition presents an appealing target for addressing the hidden hunger of global micronutrient malnutrition. In this context, biostimulants can play a key role in enhancing the nutritional quality of legumes. A broad definition of biostimulants includes compounds, substances and microorganisms that reduce the need of fertilizers and improve condition of crop without causing adverse side effects which can be applied to plants or soils to enhance nutrient efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance, plant quality traits, crop vigor, yield and support to uptake of nutrients. There are four major groups of biostimulants have been shown to affect root growth and nutrient uptake viz.; plant growth-promoting microorganisms, protein hydrolysate, amino acid formulations (AA) and seaweed extract (SE) and humic substances (HS). The recent reviews quotes plants treated with different biostimulants like Rhizobia, Pseudomonas and SE obtained from red algae (. Kappaphycus alvarezii) showed an increase content of nitrogen in chickpea and peas, iron content in mungbean and increases concentration of N, P, K, and S by up several folds in soybeans grown under rainfed condition respectively. Hence, utilization of biostimulants is one of the promising alternative methods and solution to enhance legumes production and nutrient qualities in an economically and eco-friendly way.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Agaricus bisporus and A. subrufrescens, (30%) followed by Pleurotus sp. (27%), Lentinula edodes (17%), Auricularia sp. (6%), and Flammulina (5%). During the production of these mushrooms, large amount of waste material, referred as spent mushroom waste (SMW), remained and it is estimated that approximately 5-6. kg of residual wastes are generated per kilogram of mushroom produced. This SMW poses various environment hazards coupled with contamination of ground water and natural resources if not disposed properly. SMW can be transformed into eco-friendly value added by-products using several modes. It has been estimated that more than 50 million tons of SMW are generated each year and they can be converted into fertilizers by using methods such as composting and vermicomposting. In addition to this, SMW have been shown to have potential for plant growth promotion as it contains various kinds of nutrients required for plant growth, improvement of soil properties and health, bioremediation of heavy metal and organic pollutant contaminated soils and biofuel production. These properties of SMW attracts them as promising substrate for various applications in agriculture and allied sectors.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A great effort has been made to control the overpopulation of these insects. The widespread and uncontrolled use of synthetic insecticides around the world, face the problem of resistance to these insects. This chapter proposes a literature review of the potential of the genus Baccharis spp. as an insecticide for mosquitoes and non-biting flies of veterinary importance. Baccharis is a promising genus for new natural products against insects. Plants of this genus produce broad kinds of secondary metabolites like monoterpene/sesquiterpene in essential oils and phenolic compounds in EtOH extracts. From this literature research, it is clear that Baccharis spp. have a great potential to be used as insecticides against mosquitoes and flies. Some studies have reported on this matter, mainly actions against A. aegypti, Culex sp. and flies from Calliphoridae family. Some essential oil compounds like ?-pinene, d-limonene, E-nerolidol and pinene have shown meaningful actions on insect metabolism. The further development of studies is necessary to improve the knowledge about which compounds and lethal concentration would be appropriate to use to control of dipteran outbreaks.© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

As of now Over 700 insect-infecting viruses have been isolated, mostly from Lepidoptera (560), Hymenoptera (100), Coleoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera and classified into 16 families by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Although EPV infection in insects was recorded as early as AD 16th century, but, they were characterized and classified very recently based on type of genetic material, virion morphology and size, presence or absence of envelope, presence of occlusion body, mode of action, the host range, external disease symptoms etc. The EPVs even though are successful entomopathogens, but, their difficulty in mass production, easy degradation in the environment and high species specificity has rendered them less popular among the farming community. However, recent advances in the development of new insect cell lines permissible to the in vitro virus infection; and the great development of baculoviruses as expression vectors of heterologous proteins has opened the doors for development of recombinant virus particles that have improved virulence against range of insect pests and have enhanced field efficacy. The current chapter focuses mainly on the exploitation of EPVs as potential biocontrol agents in a sustainable pest management program.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The oilseeds sector in Asian and African countries is facing challenges in sustaining the rapidly growing population with finite amount of natural resources where the use of bio-stimulants has come up as a key factor for improved nutrient management, yields and quality. The humic substance improve nutrient uptake by roots, act as polyanionic compounds increasing the cation exchange capacity of the soil, stimulate plasma membrane H+-ATPases. The L-proline and glycine betaine have antioxidant properties to scavenge free radicals and regulating the ion fluxes across the membranes, the melatonins improve stress tolerance in seedlings. With the presence of hormonal activities of gibberellic acids, brassinosteroides, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and Jasmonic acid the bio-stimulants perform various functions. The seaweeds and plant extracts with cytokinins and auxin serve as growth promoting while the one with ABA, JA, SA and ethylene work as the stress alleviators.The induced systemic resistance (ISR) is a novel plant protection strategy to manage plant diseases and the ISR-inducing PGPR is a useful tool to reduce diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to JA- and ethylene-dependent defenses. Integrating ISR-triggering PGPR into disease management program in conjunction with other strategies are best approaches.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Their requirements are less and favoring the good performance of the plant's vital processes resulted high yield and good quality products. The active substances used as biostimulants include humic and fulvic acids, protein hydrolysates, seaweed extracts, beneficial fungi, bacteria and algae. It may be single or multicomponent formulations although it can provide positive action of different components. Biostimulants can be applied as foliar or soil. They may be hydrolysis, fermented or extracted products. They are not harmful to the environment and have potential to reduce soil degradation and atmospheric pollution. They are more effective under horticultural crops especially fruits and vegetables. They have the potential to use as a component of sustainable crop production.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Besides, the characteristics of the pedoclimate and cropping systems additionally increase the fluctuation in the behavior of digestate. Nevertheless, there are certain possibilities to make a few determinations on digestates contrasted to mineral Nitrogenous fertilizers and animal manures. Potentially high fertilizer value is seen when it comes to digestates because of its contents like available N, P, K, and micronutrients which helps it to sustain high crop yields. Nonetheless, there might be a substantial variation in the concentration of nutrients and balance between nutrients. Based on feedstock, AD process, and treatments a high variability is seen in the quality of digestates; which features the significance of explicit examination before digestate can be proficiently considered for any fertilization plan. The organic matter content of digestate is reduced and stabilized by anaerobic digestion process which leads to possible advantages from an environmental perspective by decreasing uncontrolled outflows of methane, CO2, and nitrate leaching. Anaerobic digestion does not lead to a reduction in total amount of nitrogen but an increase in inorganic ammonium is seen. Nitrogen use efficiency achieved by the crops during the first year of application is frequently higher when compared to the time post livestock manure application and it can also be alike with the reference mineral N fertilizers. Nitrogen in digestate, when applied to the soil, leads to certain environmental issues and these issues are almost identical to the issues that raw livestock manures cause in a general evaluation of biogas plant system, considering the disposal of by-products and the integration of cropping system with fertilization plans.© 2022 Sanjay Sharma.In industrial or business cases, purchasing and procurement are significant functions.

Keeping in view, the challenges regarding agro-ecosystem and the environment, the recent traits in biotechnology gives an extra dependable strategy to tackle the food protection for future generations and unravel the complex environmental problems. Existing agricultural methodologies and practices received by the farmers had improved yield, which is not sustainable for a longer time and created environmental pollution problems. A quest for alternative methodologies with non-invasive, financially savvy, and naturally agreeable choices should have been presented in agricultural practices. Research studies indicate that cyanobacteria are one of the emerging potential candidates to address the requirements of increased food production, energy, bio-fertilizers, and secondary metabolites of nutritional value, cosmetics, and medicinal products. Cyanobacteria farming helps enhancement of soil fertility, decrease the level of greenhouse gas, i.e., CO2, and it can likewise be utilized for eliminating different contaminants from water and soil. The utilization of this green growth biomass had improved the physical and chemical characteristics of soil, such as mineral, nutrient composition, and water holding capacity of the degraded and polluted terrains. Cyanobacteria can be produced within a limited time and capable of fixing the atmospheric nitrogen. They are utilizing different genetic engineering techniques with alteration of genes in cyanobacterial biomass leading to the generation of economically sustainable biofuels. However, the utilization of cyanobacteria for resolving the above-mentioned problems is subject to economic viability. This review provides details on the recent advances & developmental aspects of cyanobacterial species in accomplishing agricultural and environmental sustainability.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The quest to increase the agricultural production for fulfilling the food demands of perpetually increasing population has led to the explicit usage of numerous agrochemicals. Although, the introduction of agrochemicals significantly upsurged the agricultural production but the explicit usage of these agrochemicals has significantly deteriorated the health of agroecosystems owing to their recalcitrant nature and longer persistence in the environment. Their entry into the food chain has also affected the health of higher forms of life. Adding more to the concern, the employment of chemical surfactants in developing the agrochemical formulations not only causes a noticeable upsurge in their toxicity but the chemical nature of surfactant also lays a negative impact on the sustainable management of the environment. The persistence of chemical surfactants in the agroecosystems is highly toxic toward the lower forms of life. Furthermore, the surfactants ultimately end up in the water resources where they not only contaminate the water but the foaming instigated by chemical surfactants leads to the creation of hypoxic environments which puts a negative effect on the aquatic life. Microbially synthesized surfactants called as biosurfactants are tension-active compounds which offer numerous advantages such as low toxicity, improved biodegradability and ecological acceptability and can prove to be potential alternate for chemically synthesized surfactants. They can potentially replace the chemical surfactants in the agrochemical formulations. Their inherent low CMC values can prove to be an auspicious tool for reducing the dose of agrochemicals as they can produce similar toxicity at lower levels. In addition to it, their potential and established role as agents of bioremediation can improve the health of soil systems. They enhance the solubility of toxic and residual pesticides therefore can make them available for biodegradation to other microbial systems. The present chapter highlights the toxicity instigated by chemical surfactants and proposes the employment of biosurfactants as potential alternate to chemical surfactants for eco-friendly management of agroecosystems and in bioremediation of agricultural environments.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, dairy large amounts of biological wastes, mainly from livestock, are discharged or eliminated without application. The majority of these residues is very rich in nutrients and fatty acids, being a strategic substrate for energy production through Anaerobic Digestion (AD). Such a technique valorizes the animal wastes for energy and fertilizer purposes. However, for its land application, the final effluent (digestate) must correspond to sanitary requirements aspects, in the aim to reduce the microbial risk associated with the pathogens that could be present on the animal wastes. In this sense, some pre or post-treatments may be applied to the AD, corroborating with the natural inactivation power of this process. Furthermore, the use of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) is a valuable tool for the management and reduction of health risks in the recycling of animal effluents and waste. This tool, based on a calculation of risk, epidemiology, and behavior of pathogens, supports the search for the most adequate processes for pathogens inactivation and best digestate handling.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Hence, biostimulants are successfully used in both horticulture and agriculture. Number of abiotic stresses affects the plants development and quality of the crops, in such a case biostimulants are used to counteract the abiotic stress. Several companies are focusing on the bio-preparation of new composition of biostimulants and also involved in the identification of most active molecules of different types of plant extract that are able to influence the plant response against abiotic stress. Most of the bioactive components of the biostimulants are unknown.

Systematic application of plant based products, have up-scaled nutrition uptake; exhibited growth promoting activity; improved different modes of environmental stress tolerance; emphasized defense dynamics and significantly enhanced crop productivity. However, selection, characterization, dosage optimization, technical constrains and real-time evaluation are the five major complex bottlenecks in front of wide range acceptance of BEs and SEs. The presence of polysaccharides, poly-phenols, macro and micro nutrients, vitamins, fatty acids and phyto-hormones, in BEs and SEs, have attributed in growth and development of many economically important crops; ameliorated stress induced oxidative damage improved post-harvest quality and gross agricultural output. Leaf extracts of Moringa oleifera Lam., powdered preparation of Medicago sativa L., seaweed liquid spray are some of the common examples of plant derived biostimulants. In this review, we have provided deep insight on underlying mechanism of physiochemical regulation mediated by BEs and SEs and discussed their economic prospects as well as impact as biostimulants. Moreover, the authors have recommended possible innovative strategies and state-of the art modification of research and development programs to overcome the barriers in face of large-scale commercialization of BEs and SEs as integral part of sustainable agriculture system.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Exponential increase in universal human population, depletion of cultivable agricultural landscape, and massive diminution of natural resources are the most pivotal key factors which hinder to attain the current demand of sustainable food supply. One of the most sustainable and green revolutionary approach is implementation of algae based biofertilizers to control over need of food supply. Chemical fertilizers have been applied since last several decades. However, Chemical fertilizers are not ecologically and environmentally benign. Algae are one of most promising outlet as potential biofertilizers which biologically transform the solar energy and various gases (i.e., carbon dioxide and nitrogen) into high value added chemical products (i.e., biofertilizers) through large scale biomass generation. Therefore, algal biofertilizers can substitute the traditional chemical biofertilizers considering omnipresence, accelerated metabolic flux, short span of generation time, and constitutional capabilities to transform biologically benign nitrogen gas towards plant accessible soluble nitrogenous derivatives through nitrogen fixation along with carbon dioxide sequestration and accessibilities of phosphorous potassium. To this end, aforementioned naive features of algae, economical feasibility, technical acceptability and environmental benefits defecate algal biomass as a most promising and demanding bioresource for sustainable green agricultural technology in near future. Hence, the current chapter emphasizes on current trends and progresses on algae based biofertilizers generations and its potent applications for ameliorating current agricultural technology to support increasing demand of food supply.© 2022 Jochen Wild.This book presents a detailed look at high-lift aerodynamics, which deals with the aerodynamic behavior of lift augmentation means from various approaches.

Entirely complex and largest (multicellular) macroscopic algal clusters found in sea are known as seaweeds or macroalgae. Seaweeds are used in agriculture for ages and well acknowledged for their plant growth enhancing properties. Extracts of seaweed are rich in phytohormones such as auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene as well as amino acids, vitamins, betains, polyamines, carrageenans, polysaccharides and sterols which play significant role as a biostimulant, elicitor for abiotic stress and increase the productivity of plants. Besides being stimulant for growth, seaweed saps are known for their antimicrobial potency and ability to provide protection to plants against their natural invaders. In general, extracts of seaweed can induce changes in the physiological/biochemical process associated with plant nutrient uptake and growth in agriculture.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Secondary metabolites are utilized as food, flavors, color dyes, poisons, perfumes, essential oils in aroma industries, industrial products such as rubber and oils apart from being involved in countering various biotic and abiotic stresses in crop plants.Plant Biostimulants are those compounds that promote crop growth, fruit setting, agricultural productivity, nutrient and water use efficiency and are also capable of improving the tolerance against a wide range of abiotic stresses. Both secondary metabolites and plant biostimulants have been implicated in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants which is eventually opening up our horizon in its application in sustainable agriculture practices in various agro - ecological regions of the world.© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this simulation study, we proposed a new silicon heterojunction solar cell (n-ZnSe/p-Si/p-NiOX) as a potential candidate for photovoltaic application. In this device, a thin layer of zinc selenide has been proposed as an electron-selective contact while nickel oxide as a hole-selective contact. A one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator has been used to investigate the performance of the proposed device by varying the various physical parameters like defects densities at both the interfaces (n-ZnSe/p-Si and p-Si/p-NiOX), absorber layer doping density, absorber layer defects densities, absorber layer thickness, capture cross-sections of the carriers, operating temperature, series resistance, shunt resistance, and hole-selective contact. A comparison between n-ZnSe/p-Si & n-ZnSe/p-Si/p-NiOX heterojunction solar cells has also been performed. In our study, we have found that the higher concentration of interface defect density at the n-ZnSe/p-Si interface deteriorates the performance of the device substantially more than the p-Si/p-NiOX interface. Further, the presence of hole-selective contact improves the open-circuit voltage as well as the efficiency of the device considerably. In this work, the best simulated open-circuit voltage is 744 mV and efficiency is 19.39%. These optimized parameters owing to provide a new path to fabricate a highly efficient silicon heterojunction solar cells.© 2022 Elsevier GmbHThe advent of the quadratic-phase Fourier transform (QPFT) is one of the contemporary developments in the context of integral transforms. This article focuses on an interplay between the well-known Zak transform and the QPFT. To begin with, we formulate the Zak transform in quadratic-phase Fourier domain, braced with an example. In addition, we establish a novel convolution structure in the context of quadratic-phase Zak transform and obtain the corresponding convolution theorem. Finally, we study the Weyl–Heisenberg frames associated with the Quadratic-phase Zak Transform.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.To improve the transmission rate of wireless communications, the communication frequency band will gradually go higher, and the use of millimeter wave and terahertz will become mainstream in the future. However, the signal attenuation in high bands is considerable, which prevents the achievement of long-distance transmissions. In this paper, we propose a 3D modulation scheme that is especially suitable for high-speed baseband digital communication systems. The proposed scheme is simulated and tested in an experiment. With the same order of modulation, the 3D modulation shows a significant decrement in bit error rate and enables a longer transmission distance.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper assumes the reader is intimately familiar with Special Relativity's (SRT's) model and equations. The paper summarizes the empirical data in terms of the two main categories of interpretations of SRT currently taught in college/universities, physics texts and discussed in physics journals. Inconsistencies between the data on proper time accumulation rates and SRT are discussed. All the standard rebuttals to claims of flaws or limitations in SRT associated with one set of empirical data are ruled out by other sets of empirical data. The paper focuses on proper time data as proper time is absolute and observer independent, in contrast to the observer-centric SRT spacetime views, AND any absolute effects are cumulative and, hence, especially well-suited for revealing the absolute physical reality that underlies the relativistic view.© 2022 Author(s).This research was conducted to determine the characteristics of changes in the light polarization angle of colloidal silver solution. The method used in this research is electro-optic polarization, the light source used is a green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. Characteristics of changes in the polarization angle of light in colloidal silver solutions are obtained by varying the concentration of colloidal silver solutions (16.3 ppm, 8 ppm, 7.1 ppm, 4.6 ppm, 4.1 ppm, 3.4 ppm) and adding an electric field of 0-9 kV. The results showed that the addition when the concentration of colloidal silver solution caused a non-linear change in the angle of polarization. The highest changes in the polarization angle of light occurred at a concentration of 4.1 ppm and 4.6 ppm. The natural polarization method was carried out in this study to compare the results on electrooptic polarization. The results showed that the change in the angle of electrooptic polarization was greater than that of natural polarization. The addition of the electric field to electrooptic polarization results in the formation of electric dipoles in the solution which causes the change in the angle of electrooptic polarization to increase.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.In traditional water-based dyeing system, a low fixation of reactive dye requires six to ten times washing after dyeing, which consumes a lot of water and results in huge dyeing effluent. To alleviate this issue, the development of a sustainable dyeing technology of cotton textile is essential. In the present investigation, silicone non-aqueous medium was employed to improve the fixation of dye with a pad-dyeing process under the optimized dyeing parameters. The appropriate washing-free dyeing conditions were recommended as follows: the padded fabric was placed at 105 °C for 15–30 s to complete pre-drying to decrease the water content rapidly, and then fixed in non-aqueous medium for 80–90 s at 95 °C. After dyeing, the dyed fabric was treated with 30 g/l fixing agent through pre-dried at 80 °C and baked at 160 °C. The results indicated that the final fixation of dye was above 95 %, and the dry rubbing fastness of dyed cotton fabric can reach grade 5. Moreover, the wet rubbing fastness and washing fastness of dyed cotton fabric can reach grade 3–4 and 4, respectively. Therefore, it can obtain the washing-free dyeing of cotton fabric with reactive dye. If the washing procedure was omitted in the industrial application, the environmental cost of cotton dyeing would be greatly decreased. This method provides a substantial reduction in wastewater effluent, which will be considerably potential for industrial application.© 2022 IEEE.The charging patterns of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners have a substantial impact on the distribution network's reliability. Uncertainty over arrival and departure dates makes scheduling plug-in hybrid electric cars difficult, particularly in regulated (non-liberal) electricity markets. Monitoring the arrival and departure periods of electric vehicles (EVs) in general has become one of the most essential parts in green and intelligent micro-systems; hence, anticipating the arrival and departure times of PEVs may assist manage the grid effectively. The purpose of this paper is to predict the arrival and departure times of electric vehicles in public charging station in to better distribute electric power on the grid as well as assess the expected impact of additional EVs on the grid, considering specific characteristics of the Moroccan power system. Consequently, three deep learning methods are applied in this research and the approach is validated using a dataset consisting of 1793 charging events collected from public charging stations in Morocco. Obtained results will serve as a decision-making tool for electricity regulatory authorities (ONEE) and public utility companies in the selection and implementation of efficient smart charging strategies, including the potential for electric vehicles (EVs) to use renewable energy more efficiently, lowering costs while improving the Moroccan electricity grid's stability.© 2022 Author(s).The development of the Portland cement concrete industry is expanding globally until now. The demand for concrete or mortar as a construction material continues to increase due to the increase in infrastructure development. This increase causes environmental problems, namely carbon dioxide gas emissions. Recently cement has become a concern among environmentalists in the world. This is because carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced from cement production which has an impact on global warming and environmental pollution. Therefore, various studies have been conducted to find environmentally friendly alternatives to cement. One way is to develop a geopolymer. The purpose of this study was to measure the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete with the addition of hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2). This experimental test was carried out using a cube-shaped specimen measuring 15 × 15 × 15 cm. Cement substitute binders are class C fly ash and alkaline activator (NaOH 8M+Na2SiO3) and quenched lime as a substitute for 20% of fine aggregate. The characteristics of the concrete tested were the compressive strength of the concrete at the age of 7, 14 and 28 days with curing oven at 60°C for 24 hours and air curing, the total number was 6 of specimens. The results showed that the maximum compressive strength of the sample at 28 days reached 19.92 MPa. This result is not in accordance with the planned compressive strength of concrete, namely 20.75 MPa (K250). In addition, the addition of quenched lime to geopolymer concrete can complicate the workability process because the slump test value is very small, which is only 6 cm.© 2022 Author(s).Styrofoam waste is hazardous waste for both humans and the environment so that styrofoam recycling becomes more necessary. In this paper, styrofoam waste reported successfully nitrated with nitric acid/sulfuric acid mixture to form an adsorbent to remove Cu(II) and Mn(II) from aqueous solutions. The adsorbent was synthesized with times and sizes variations and also characterized by FTIR. In 24 hours synthesizing conditions and 60 mesh styrofoam size, the property of degree of incorporated cation exchange found 6 mmol/g. The optimum contact time for Cu(II) and Mn(II) removal was 60 min with the removal percentage of 90,8% and 14,2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the addition of 25 mg adsorbent could remove 74,4% of Cu(II) and 16,5% Mn(II). The optimum addition of adsorbent weight was 125 mg with the removal percentage of Cu(II) and Mn(II) were 78,9% and 20,6%, respectively.© 2022 IEEE.With the deepening of the reform of the power system, the electricity sales side has gradually opened up, and various types of participants have emerged, such as service providers and integrators. These new entities can achieve the integration of small, scattered and flexible loads on the demand side, making the household load also. Being able to participate in demand response in the power market expands the scope of demand response capabilities. With the large-scale deployment and performance improvement of smart meters, more and more attention is paid to the non-metering functions of smart meters. How to mine and extract massive amounts of smart measurement data is also the current opportunity and challenge. This paper mainly aims at the problem of non-intrusive load decomposition in an environment with relatively tight computing resources, and proposes a non-intrusive load decomposition method based on edge load behavior labeling. A non-intrusive load decomposition method using load characteristics to modify integer planning is proposed to modify the optimal solution of the integrated planning problem, and a cloud, edge, and end-user synchronization computing framework combining 2-SAX and MIP-AC2S is proposed, which eases the data link The transmission pressure of road and cloud computing center.© 2022We study the modal matrix differential equation of an elastically coupled double-beam Timoshenko system. Its general solution is determined by using the matrix basis generated by a fundamental matrix response. This later is found, through convolution, to be a perturbation of the uncoupled Timoshenko double-beam system. This approach allows to identify elements belonging to each beam and make use of knowledge already established for single beams. The fundamental matrix response as an initial value problem with impulsive conditions is split into the matrix response of a Timoshenko double-beam system and a forced response due to the elastic connection. Eigenanalysis is formulated in terms of the fundamental matrix response. Simulations were performed for classical and non-classical boundary conditions. Their mode shapes were compared with those of a single beam.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.This article manages assessing the recurrence reaction of practically reviewed carbon nanotube strengthened composites exposed to open and shut electro-attractive circuit conditions.

Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, as a kind of abiotic stress factor, affected the growth and secondary metabolism in M. alba. Previous studies indicated that the contents of several secondary metabolites such as moracin N, chalcomaricin were significantly increased under high level UV-B radiation and dark incubation in M. alba leaves. To reveal the response mechanism under UV-B radiation and dark incubation in M. alba leaves, SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed. Totally, 716 proteins were identified and quantified in the control, UVB, and UVD groups. Among them, 123 proteins and 96 proteins were identified as differentially abundant proteins in UVB group and UVD groups, respectively. Proteins related to photosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and tocopherol biosynthesis were significantly altered in UVB group, while proteins related to the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds were significantly altered in UVD group. In addition, the abundances of proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) were significantly increased in both UVB and UVD groups, indicating that UPS combined with secondary mechanism participated in the resistance to UV-B radiation and dark incubation. The obtained results provide novel insight into the effects of high level UV-B radiation on M. alba leaves and on the strategies used for maximizing the chemical constituents and the medicinal value of the M. alba leaves.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Oxidative degradation of polymers is caused by combination of Fe2+ and O2 resulting in viscosity loss. During lab tests, synthetic brine without Fe2+ is commonly used. However, most lab and field set-ups are made of stainless steel (SS) which is a possible source of Fe. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of Fe2+ and O2 contents on polymer stability with/without contact of SS in presence/absence of protective packages (ITW and oxygen scavenger). Polymer stability tests were conducted for 1 week at ambient temperature under different O2 concentrations. Four polymer systems were evaluated (without additives, with ITW, with oxygen scavenger and with ITW+oxygen scavenger). Samples were stored in SS and glass bottles. Different Fe2+ concentrations were added to the solutions in the glass bottles. The viscosity of the polymer solutions was measured at anaerobic conditions at different intervals. Viscosity results for polymer samples aged in glass bottles showed that ITW alone or in combination with oxygen scavenger is able to maintain polymer stability up to Fe2+ and O2 levels of 2.5 ppm and 1500 ppb, respectively. At atmospheric condition, these systems were found efficient as the maximum obtained viscosity loss was < 14%. While samples containing only oxygen scavenger maintained polymer stability up to Fe2+ and O2 levels of 2.5 ppm and 500 ppb, respectively, but experienced severe degradation when exposed to atmosphere. Similarly, blank samples experienced severe degradation after exposure to atmosphere and the stability was maintained up to Fe2+ and O2 levels of 0.5 ppm and 500 ppb, respectively. Polymer solutions stored in SS cells experienced noticeable viscosity loss indicating that Fe is released from the SS and contribute to polymer degradation. The blank samples and samples containing oxygen scavenger were stable up to O2 level of 500 ppb. Addition of ITW into these polymer solutions boosted its viscosity stability up to O2 level of 1500 ppb. Exposing polymer samples containing either ITW or oxygen scavenger to atmosphere resulted in severe degradation of around 42% which is higher than the viscosity loss of the blank sample (28%). However, when both ITW and oxygen scavenger were added to the polymer solution and exposed to atmosphere, the viscosity loss was reduced to 26%. This study showed that polymer stability in presence/absence of protective packages can be maintained at initial O2 level of 500 ppb. These findings are directly related to polymer stability during polymer preparation which needs to be considered in any polymer flood design. As protective packages might come handy for maintaining polymer stability in the reservoir, this study can aid in selection of the most feasible protective packages and water treatment requirements.© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This paper aims to propose a new strategy to functionalize zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) to improve its dispersion stability and tribological properties in lubricating oil. Design/methodology/approach: Dialkyl dithiophosphate polydopamine ZIF-8 (DDP@PDA@ZIF-8) was prepared via mussel-inspired chemistry and the Michael addition reaction. The tribological properties of DDP@PDA@ZIF-8 as an additive in the white oil were evaluated with four-ball friction and wear tester at different temperatures. The worn surface was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). Findings: The as-prepared DDP@PDA@ZIF-8 shows high dispersion stability in the white oil. Tribological results confirmed that the DDP@PDA@ZIF-8 exhibited a small wear scar diameter at 25°C. However, excellent friction reduction and anti-wear properties were observed at 75°C. The XPS result indicates that a series of tribochemical reactions occurred on the worn surface, forming the complex protective film. Originality/value: This paper provides a study of highly dispersed ZIF-8 as lubrication additives.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this paper, a fuzzy information granulation method combined with a support vector machine time series prediction model(FIG-SVM) is established for a subway cross passage project of Ningbo Metro Line 3.

However, its measurement precision of velocity is often affected by background light or interference light. Unfortunately, the frequency filtering method cannot filter out background noise, the frequency of which is the same as of the signal light, so the precision cannot be further improved. In this paper, we propose a heterodyne detection system based on optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) modulation to eliminate the effect of noise at the same frequency. Meanwhile, we use Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GM-APD) at the receiving end to improve the response sensitivity of the signal light by photon counting method. Then we consider the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the signal light and theoretically derive the expression of heterodyne efficiency at this time. Subsequently, we apply the Gerchberg–Saxton (GS) phase restoration algorithm to the receiving end to improve the velocity measurement precision. The simulation results show that the GS algorithm can improve the velocity measurement precision; when iteration number of GS algorithm is 200 and the structure constant Cn2 of refractive index of atmospheric turbulence is 1 ∙ 10−14 m−2/3, the velocity measurement precision is improved by 63.0% compared with the original value.© 2022 by the authors.

Modifying surfaces of materials without resorting to altering their bulk properties is an effective route to alleviate corrosion, friction and wear, encountered in engineering applications. With the advancements in the field of nanotechnology, surface protective coatings with nanomaterials can be readily developed to explore their functionality in mitigating chemical/physical damage of surfaces. Surface protection enhances performance and operating lifetimes of industrial machinery components. This review presents insights on various types of recently developed nanostructured coatings, their synthesis routes, corrosion behaviour and tribological performance.

We taked the measurement result of the HMP155A humidity sensor at 55% RH as the research object, and analyzed the correlation of its input quantities. After compatibility judgment and calculation of correlation coefficients, the correlation degree was quantified. The evaluation results show that the extended uncertainty of the forward and reverse stroke are both 1.2%RH. The research results show that the measurement uncertainty deviated when the correlation between input quantities was not analyzed, which can easily lead to errors in the determination of instrument conformity. Using this method can effectively make up for the lack of correlation analysised in GUM's evaluation of humidity sensors in the past, the evaluation content is closer to reality, and the evaluation results are more true and reliable.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.La0.7Pb0.3MnO3(LPMO) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by sol–gel auto-combustion method. These were embedded in P(VDF-TrFE) to form (0–3) nanocomposite (NC) films by solution casting method for 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 vol.% of LPMO. Phase and morphology studies on LPMO NPs reveal R-3c structure and mean particle size of (61.03 ± 17.41) nm, respectively. The XRD and SEM studies on LPMO/P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite films confirm the presence of constitutive phases and dispersion of LPMO particle in P(VDF-TrFE) matrix. There is increase in permittivity of NC films (above 1 vol.% of LPMO) in low frequency region (< 1 kHz) due to MWS effect. The observation of low DC leakage current density (~ 10−6A/mm2) at application of high field and low tangent loss (< 0.01) for NC films signifies presence of very small free charge carriers in NC films. Proper ferroelectric loop is obtained for NC film up to 2 vol.% of LPMO in polymer matrix. Magnetization (M) measurements of LPMO NPs confirm the ferromagnetic nature and the existence of Curie temperature at ~ 357 K of these NPs. M-H characteristics for NC films demonstrate the increase in magnetization of NC films with increase in volume percentage of NPs. The interface coupling between ferroelectric polarization and magnetization in NC films was verified by measuring magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient of these NC films. A maximum ME coupling coefficient (α31V) of 170.15 mV/Oe-cm is observed for NC films having 0.2 LPMO vol.% with a self-bias voltage of 12.68 mV. A negative MD effect is observed in NC films, and a maximum magneto-dielectric coupling (MDC%) of − 6.4 at 0.7 T is also witnessed for NC films having 5 LPMO vol.%. Graphical abstract: Interface coupled phenomenon by polarization and magnetization in LPMO/P(VDF-TrFE) thick film results in excellent magnetoelectric (ME) and magneto-dielectric (MD) coefficients.

The carried out investigations concern microstructure tests and tests of mechanical properties of rails after several years of exposure in the open air without usage. The purpose of the work was to determine on the basis of the results of research the possibilities of using the tested rail for usage and application for the construction of tracks on railway sidings. For investigations there were used diverse techniques reaching such engineering materials investigations like light or scanning electron microscope for microstructure investigations, as well as hardness and microhardness test were performed for determinations of the microstructural changes occurred in the upper area of the rails surface. The microstructure changes concerns especially the ferritic and pearlitic structure and the breaks in the present carbide mesh. During investigations it was found out that the tested railway rails are fully useful for application, after machining to achieve required dimensional parameters. It is also of high importance, of the economical point of view, that their price, also in case of earlier installation of the rails, may be lower than the current price offered on the marked for a entire new product. The price difference reaches dimensions in the range of 5–10%.© 2022 Author(s).Pressure drop and heat loss parameter are required when designing pipe system and determining separator location. The calculation of pressure drop and heat loss is complex and time-consuming when manually calculated. Therefore, this paper explains about software interface to create a model and simulation of thermal heat loss and pressure drop calc ulations on the pipe system. For the condition of one phase fluid, we will use the Homogeneous method, while the condition of two-phase fluid, Beggs-Brill, Harrison-Freeston, or Zhao-Freeston methods will be used. This software has been validated using a serie s of pipes in Wayang Windu Geothermal Field (WWQ-3). WWQ-3 has wellhead pressure 12,7 bar-a, enthalpy 2745 kJ/kg, total ma ss flow 9,6 kg/s and 14 data pipe fitting. The result of total heat loss is 8,14 kW and the total pressure loss is 0,13 bar-a with Harris on-Freeston method, 0,12 bar-a with Zhao-Freeston method, and 0,19 bar-a with Beggs-Brill method. All of those methods get l ess than 1% error, with Beggs-Brill method giving the best estimation. Comparison between model and data complies with the expected minimum error, so the model is considered to be valid and can be used for simulation.© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.Abstract: The wavefield is investigated in a two-dimensional problem of nontangential incidence of high-frequency wave from a point source on an impedance contour with a jump in curvature.

However, the carrier mobility and on/off ratio in current of traditional silicon-integrated graphene devices are largely limited due to the substrate-induced scattering effect. Exploring new device structure to prepare graphene devices is an important way to improve their performance. In this work, we propose a new fabricate technique for suspended Graphene/hBN van der Waals heterostructure device with high vield. Combined with improved transfer technology, it greatly improves the probability of successful suspending graphene devices, and we found that the Dirac point of the suspended graphene device is located in nearly zero gate voltage, which reduced the doping in graphene effectively, and further proved the advantages of our device structure in fabricating suspended devices.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryA ternary metal oxide CuBi2O4 has received immense attention in the research field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water or CO2 reduction owing to its ideal optical bandgap and positive photocurrent onset potential. However, CuBi2O4 photocathodes have limitations regarding charge-carrier separation within and transport across the interface to an n-type FTO substrate. In this study, a novel thin Fe-doped NiOX layer was attached to the copper vacancy-induced CuBi2O4 (CBO-O2) back-interface. X-ray photoelectron and energy dispersive spectroscopies provided evidence for copper vacancies within CBO; atomic force microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed improved surface conductivity and interface charge transfer between CBO-O2 and Fe:NiOX. The CBO-O2 photocathode exhibits a higher hole-concentration with superior charge-separation, and the Fe:NiOX layer acts as an efficient hole-transport layer (HTL) at the back interface. The PEC performance characteristic of the Fe:NiOX/CBO-O2 photocathode increased four fold than that of a conventional-heating CBO photoelectrode (CBO-Air). Additionally, the Fe:NiOX/CBO-O2 photocathode with a protective layer revealed about 4 h stability and 96% faradaic efficiency. The improved photocurrent of the device is attributed to the increased acceptor density in CBO and effective hole transportation across the back interface with positive-band alignment. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing high-performance ternary metal oxide-based photocathodes/photoanodes for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy applications.© 2022, Higher Education Press.This paper presents a seismic topology optimization study of steel braced frames with shape memory alloy (SMA) braces. Optimal SMA-braced frames (SMA-BFs) with either Fe-based SMA or NiTi braces are determined in a performance-based seismic design context. The topology optimization is performed on 5- and 10-story SMA-BFs considering the placement, length, and cross-sectional area of SMA bracing members. Geometric, strength, and performance-based design constraints are considered in the optimization. The seismic response and collapse safety of topologically optimal SMA-BFs are assessed according to the FEMA P695 methodology. A comparative study on the optimal SMA-BFs is also presented in terms of total relative cost, collapse capacity, and peak and residual story drift. The results demonstrate that Fe-based SMA-BFs exhibit higher collapse capacity and more uniform distribution of lateral displacement over the frame height while being more cost-effective than NiTi braced frames. In addition to a lower unit price compared to NiTi, Fe-based SMAs reduce SMA material usage. In frames with Fe-based SMA braces, the SMA usage is reduced by up to 80%. The results highlight the need for using SMAs with larger recoverable strains.© 2022 IEEE.This paper presents an effective power flow management of microgrids system, which includes PV array, pack of batteries and variable AC load.

The thickness of silver, silicon and heterostructures BlueP/MoS2 layers are optimized under the consideration of less reflectivity, full width at half maxima and enhanced sensitivity. After thickness optimization, the performance parameters of the proposed SPR sensor have also been calculated in terms of sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy. The performance effected by increasing the number of heterostructure BlueP/MoS2 layer is also analyzed. It is also observed that Si layer plays an important role to enhance all performance parameters when it is deposited between silver and heterostructure BlueP/MoS2 layer. The optimized sensitivity at wavelength 633 nm of the heterostructure BlueP/MoS2 monolayer and silicon layer is 282°RIU-1. The highest optimized sensitivity 328°RIU>-1 is achieved with two layers of heterostructure BlueP/MoS2 having thickness of silicon layer 5 nm. It is found that sensitivity is increased by 16% when number of heterostructure layers has changed. Another important parameter like detection accuracy, quality factor, Full width at half maximum have been also calculated for proposed SPR sensor. The TM (transverse magnetic) field plot and PD (penetration depth) 138.25 nm of the proposed SPR sensor have been also calculated.© 2022 Society of Plastics Engineers.The study aimed at developing a cytocompatible dental polymer composite with high mechanical and surface characteristics by reinforcing polymethyl methacrylate resin with graphene nanoplatelets and montmorillonite nanoclay. After ball milling the particles into the polymer samples were prepared via conventional compression molding method. Samples were tested for flexural strength, polishability, fatigue failure, wear, hardness, and cytotoxicity. The fracture mode and surface polish were tested using a field emission scanning electron microscope. Most properties displayed enhancement at the tested fraction weight in relation to the control, while some properties were downgraded. However, the tested polymer composite was cytocompatible at all concentrations. Within study limits, graphene nanoplatelets and montmorillonite nanoclay reinforced polymer brought about a positive effect to a particular degree. Establishing optimal concentration of reinforcement and alternate blending methods may boost the resultant characteristics of the resin composite.© 2022 IEEE.In recent years, the concentration of the world's population in urban areas has become a big issue.

In this study, heterogeneous Ru(III) catalysts on N-doped mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (N-MCHS) were synthesized through a SiO2-templated resorcinol–formaldehyde polymer pyrolysis at different temperatures. At low pyrolysis temperatures (700–800 °C), the dominant N species on the catalysts were found to be pyrrolic and pyridinic N (Npyrrolic and Npyridinic). However, the dominant N species on the samples produced from 900 to 1000 °C was graphitic N (Ngraphitic). The highest catalytic activities on the batch hydrogenation experiments were recorded on the catalysts with the predominant Ru–Ngraphitic active sites. Using the Ru/N-MCHS-900 catalyst, the turn-over number (TON) was as high as 7550 after the hydrogenation for 2 h at 120 °C and 8 MPa. On the other hand, the Ru/N-MCHS-700 catalyst exhibited excellent stability in both batch and continuous reactors. No noticeable deactivation was observed even after 72 h of continuous hydrogenation, which can be attributed to the strong binding energy between the Ru(III) species, and the Npyridinic and Npyrrolic sites on the N-MCHS supports.

Due to the presence of a large amount of carboxyl groups and the self-bundling of water insoluble CNTs, the CNT-PAA exhibited a high Pb2+-immobilization capability, allowing them to retain the lead components on the substrates and reduce lead(II) leaching below the hazardous waste limit once occasionally exposed to water. Moreover, the PAA chains on the CNTs surface can strongly chelate with Pb2+ to accelerate crystal nucleation in precursor solution and to passivate undercoordinated defects in the as-achieved thin films, and the inserted CNTs within the perovskite grains can regulate the perovskite growth with vertical orientation and boost both electron and hole mobility, resulting in eliminated nonradiative recombination and facilitated charge transport across the perovskite layer.© 2022, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd.

The energy flow and electromechanical coupling characteristics as well as influence of electrolyzer number on dynamic characteristics of system are simulated and analyzed under variable wind speed conditions. The results show that although hydrogen production power for separate excitation is higher than that for self-excitation at the same wind speed, the influences of separate excitation and self-excitation on the internal dynamic load of transmission system are not obvious. Separate excitation and self-excitation have a slight influence on dynamic characteristics of system during wind speed increase process. During wind speed decrease process, separate excitation and self-excitation have an obvious influence on dynamic characteristics of system. Separate excitation takes longer to reach steady-state speed and produces multiple impulse loads in varying speed process, which increases low-frequency excitation of system. Increasing electrolyzer number can increase hydrogen production rate at a certain wind speed. The electrolyzer number has little influence for self-excitation, but increasing electrolyzer number will worsen dynamic characteristics for separate excitation.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryNanoengineering has always been an effective way to optimize thermoelectric materials. Multi-layered nanostructures can maximize the phonon scattering efficiency and greatly reduce the thermal conductivity, thus improving the thermoelectric performance. In this work, multi-layered nanostructures are constructed in AgCuTe by alloying Cu2Se, which strongly scatters full-wavelength phonons and achieves a new low thermal conductivity at 723 K. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that additional phase boundaries, multiple Moiré fringes and regular nanophases are formed after alloying Cu2Se. Moiré fringes form high density dislocations and strong stress fields in AgCuTe, which can greatly scatter multi-wavelength phonons. In addition, the Cu+ ions generated after the dissolution of a small amount of Cu2Se participate in the electrical transport, which optimizes the electrical performance. In the end, the AgCuTe-1%Cu2Se sample achieves the lowest thermal conductivity of ∼0.45 W m−1 K−1 at 723 K, which is much lower than the average level of published AgCuTe-based materials. At the same time, between 523 K and 723 K, the average ZT ∼ 1.13 of AgCuTe-1%Cu2Se reached the leading level. This work provides a new strategy for further reducing the thermal conductivity of AgCuTe-based materials.© 2022 The AuthorsWe have constructed a novel electrochemical biosensor for detection and quantification of the Streptococcus Pneumoniae bacteria (SPB) based on change in electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) responses of the biosensing system. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was chosen as the platform of the biosensor and it was modified with lead nanoparticles (Pb NPs) and then, DNA-[FAM]CGC AAT CTA GCA GAT GAA GCA GGA AAA AAA AAA [Thiol] (DNA-FAM-S) was loaded onto Pb NPs as a selective probe for sensitive and selective determination of the SPB. After electrochemical and microscopic characterization of the modifications applied to the GCE, analytical characterization of the biosensor was performed. The biosensor had a limit of detection of 0.0022 ng/ml ~ 622 SPBs and a sensitivity of 3432.9 Ω (ng/ml)−1 or 3432.9 Ω (2.9 × 105 SPBs)−1. The biosensor response was selective, sensitive, stable, repeatable and reproducible in determination of the SPB. The biosensor performance for determination of the SPB was comparable with the NanoDrop method which encouraged us to recommend it for practical purposes.© 2022 Author(s).In this paper, the aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle model are analyzed through numerical simulation considering the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effect, and the accuracy of the simulation method is verified by comparison with the wind tunnel experiment. Then, the wind-induced vibration of vehicles under time-varying crosswind is studied and applied to engineering problems, such as vehicle sideslip and roll. The results show that the deviation between the FSI simulation and wind tunnel test is less than 10%, proving that the numerical method is feasible. The FSI effect on the aerodynamic lift is obvious, and its influence mechanism is mainly due to the change in body position, which changes the topological structure of the shedding or separated vortex in the flow field. As for the aerodynamic lift, a big gap exists between the results of the numerical simulations with and without coupling; high-intensity side wind will seriously affect the vehicle stability, and the uncoupled numerical simulation decreases the accuracy of the vehicle design.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This paper is concerned with existence and stability of V-shaped traveling fronts for a class of nonlocal dispersal equations with unbalanced bistable nonlinearity.

Seismic inversion with seismic and logging data is an efficient method to obtain the reservoir porosity. This study aims to demonstrate the spatial distribution of the reservoir porosity in an important formation in Central Iraq. 3D seismic attributes and logging data were combined to invert the reservoir porosity through neural network technology. The migrated 3D seismic volume, inverted P-wave impedance volume, seismic attributes and the logging data of 10 wells, were employed for training neural networks. Based on the training network, we generated the 3D porosity volume. To verify the accuracy of the inverted result, the inverted porosity were compared with those from the logging data of other 5 wells. Data slices were extracted with seismic horizons to show the lateral distribution of the reservoir porosity. The validation error shows the best multi-attribute pair is the pair of square root of P-wave impedance, quadrature trace, and instantaneous frequency. Neural network was trained with the three attribute pair. Analysis of the correlations between the predicted and the logging porosity showed the correlations from neural network training were higher than those achieved with multi-attribute regression. The porosity from the logging data of the 5 wells, which were not evolved in neural network training, coincided well with those from the inverted 3D porosity volume. That verified the accuracy of the inverted porosity volume from neural network inversion. Vertical sections and lateral slices of the inverted porosity volume were extracted to demonstrate the vertical and lateral distributions of the porosity, respectively. Data slices showed that the porosity were higher in the north and south area, and lower in the middle area. The study shows the porosity inverted from neural network technology is more reliable than that from muti-attribute regression. In addition, through this study, we demonstrate the porosity distribution in the project area. The new knowledge of the spatial distribution of reservoir porosity provides important guidance to the well deployment in the oilfield.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.The objective of matrix acidizing in sandstone reservoirs using acid systems that contains Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is to widen the pore throats and spaces in order to increase the permeability around the wellbore and also to remove formation damage. One of the major disadvantages of this acid system is the secondary and tertiary reactions, which may end up with precipitations that damage the formation. Because of this, pumping sufficient pre-flush and post-flush volumes of Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is critical to prevent such damaging reactions. However, the placement of such fluids still are a concern in multiple opened layers or long open intervals zones. Stimulating sandstone reservoirs in the Southern fields of the Sultanate of Oman is very challenging, especially in those that exhibit relatively low permeability. These formations, based on petrology work, contains significant amount of clays and feldspars, which make it difficult in the designing process of the acid formulation. A new version of HF acid system was recently developed. It is specially formulated, so it does not require the addition of Hydrochloric acid (HCl) pre-flush. Because of this, it can be pumped as a single stage system. In addition, its higher reactivity allows deeper penetration and it has the ability to minimize secondary reactions and damaging precipitates. Lab testing work was conducted to ensure the effectiveness of this single stage acid system. The results were promising as they show a good improvement in the rock permeability. These results were encouraging to carry field trials in the sandstone reservoirs in Oman Southern fields. Up to now, it has been pumped in these type of sandstones for oil producer wells and for water injector wells. The actual treatment using this system showed increased oil productivity by higher than 60% and higher than 80% in water injectivity. This paper presents the testing, designing and pumping of the single stage acid system, as well as the comparison with the conventional HF acid system in Southern fields of Oman. It outlines the laboratory work and analysis done as well as the field trials.© 2022 by the authors.

However, there are numerous challenges to recognizing people in real environments using eye movements, such as implicity and stimulus independence. In the instance of wayfinding, this research intends to investigate implicit and stimulus-independent eye movement biometrics in real-world situations. We collected 39 subjects’ eye movement data from real-world wayfinding experiments and derived five sets of eye movement features (the basic statistical, pupillary response, fixation density, fixation semantic and saccade encoding features). We adopted a random forest and performed biometric recognition for both identification and verification scenarios. The best accuracy we obtained in the identification scenario was 78% (equal error rate, EER = 6.3%) with the 10-fold classification and 64% (EER = 12.1%) with the leave-one-route-out classification. The best accuracy we achieved in the verification scenario was 89% (EER = 9.1%). Additionally, we tested performance across the 5 feature sets and 20 time window sizes. The results showed that the verification accuracy was insensitive to the increase in the time window size. These findings are the first indication of the viability of performing implicit and stimulus-independent biometric recognition in real-world settings using wearable eye tracking.© ESO 2022.Context. Dating stars is a major challenge with a deep impact on many astrophysical fields. One of the most promising techniques for this is using chemical abundances. Recent space- and ground-based facilities have improved the quantity of stars with accurate observations. This has opened the door for using Bayesian inference tools to maximise the information we can extract from them. Aims. Our aim is to present accurate and reliable stellar age estimates of FGK stars using chemical abundances and stellar parameters. Methods. We used one of the most flexible Bayesian inference techniques (hierarchical Bayesian models) to exceed current possibilities in the use of chemical abundances for stellar dating. Our model is a data-driven model. We used a training set that has been presented in the literature with ages estimated with isochrones and accurate stellar abundances and general characteristics. The core of the model is a prescription of certain abundance ratios as linear combinations of stellar properties including age. We gathered four different testing sets to assess the accuracy, precision, and limits of our model. We also trained a model using chemical abundances alone. Results. We found that our age estimates and those coming from asteroseismology, other accurate sources, and also with ten Gaia benchmark stars agree well. The mean absolute difference of our estimates compared with those used as reference is 0.9 Ga, with a mean difference of 0.01 Ga. When using open clusters, we reached a very good agreement for Hyades, NGC 2632, Ruprecht 147, and IC 4651. We also found outliers that are a reflection of chemical peculiarities and/or stars at the limit of the validity ranges of the training set. The model that only uses chemical abundances shows slightly worse mean absolute difference (1.18 Ga) and mean difference (-0.12 Ga).© 2022 The Authors. Published by Hosokawa Powder Technology Foundation.The simulation of grinding mills with the discrete element method (DEM) has been advancing. First, it emerged as a method for studying charge motion with spherical balls and predicting the power draw of the mill. Subsequently, studies on liner wear, charge motion with ellipsoidal and polyhedral shaped particles simulated with three dimensional DEM followed. Further, the impact energy spectra computed in the DEM algorithm is leading to the development of models for the breakage of brittle particles in mills. The core elements in such simulations are the shape of particles in the mill charge and the power draw of the mill due to operating variables. To advance the field, we present a set of experimental data and the corresponding DEM validation results for a 90 × 13 cm mill. The DEM algorithm uses the volume-overlap method which is more realistic for multifaceted irregular particle collisions. Further, we use the scanned shape of the rock media and multifaceted spherical shape for the grinding media to represent as close as possible the actual charge in the mill. First, we present DEM validation for spherical grinding media-only experiments, rock-only experiments, and a mixture of spherical grinding media and rocks, as well as aluminum cubes only to represent the theme of particle shape. Finally, a discussion of the contact mechanics parameters in the four modes of experiments is given. Since the feed ore to plant scale mills can vary in shape, mill simulations with scanned shape of typical particles are the future for more accurate results.© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe main challenge of wave energy utilization is to improve the low energy conversion efficiency. We report a novel triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based wave energy converter (WEC) control system that can significantly increase the energy harvesting efficiency via pressure control. We have identified that WECs have optimal damping corresponding to the maximum energy harvesting in different wave conditions. Hence, the optimal damping values can be applied via adjusting the pressure applied on the surface of TENG. When the external load is 1 MΩ, the instantaneous power output of the proposed TENG based WEC is able to reach 3.2 mW and the instantaneous maximum power output density arrives at 502 mW/m2 under the 8 cm wave height and 1.5 s time period condition, which shows strong power output capability and practical application potential of the TENG based WEC.© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Non-radical oxidation processes with singlet oxygen (1O2) and mediated electron transfer have emerged as efficient methods for the selective degradation of aqueous pollutants in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based catalytic systems. On this basis, in this study, transition- and lanthanide-metal co-doped manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (Cu-Nd-OMS-2) was synthesized, characterized, and tested in the degradation of aqueous parabens. Methylparaben (30 mg/L) was degraded at 100% and mineralized at 92% within 40 min in the presence of Cu-Nd-OMS-2 and PMS (200 mg/L) in pH scale ranging from 3 to 8. Compared with pristine and mono-doped catalysts, the Cu-Nd-OMS-2, produced by the doping strategy, exhibited a superior catalytic activity for the oxidative degradation of several parabens through turning the mechanism with radicals into non-radical pathway. Electron paramagnetic resonance, quenching experiments and mechanism study indicated that 1O2 and mediated electron transfer contributed to the removal of parabens. Besides, the redox cycle of Mn(III)/Mn(IV) might be responsible for PMS activation, and abundant surface hydroxyl groups as well as oxygen vacancies on the catalyst further promoted the adsorption of pollutants and the generation of 1O2. Overall, the present study provides a novel and facile doping strategy on manganese oxide catalysts for fine-tuning radical/non-radical processes towards PMS-based water remediation.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Several benefits of low salinity/engineered water injection (LSWI/EWI) have been reported in the literature including its ability to increase oil recovery at low cost and with least environmental impact. However, the related reservoir-engineering problems to these techniques such as formation damage and fluid mobility control are still uncertain and have not been thoroughly investigated. This study investigates the effect of water composition on formation damage and the related oil recovery from a geochemical prospective. The study presents coupling of the IPhreeqc geochemical engine with Matlab to simultaneously solve the oil-water multiphase flow and the related geochemical reactions. Using this coupling technique, the geochemical capabilities of Phreeqc were successfully incorporated in a multiphase flow simulator. The latter enabled modeling of reactive transport and formation damage in subsurface multiphase reservoir. The results showed that the temperature, sulfate concentration, and dilution of injection water have a pronounced effect on formation dissolution and precipitation during LSWI/EWI. Also, anhydrite scale is the main controlling solid specie for formation damage. In addition, high temperature water injection should be avoided in carbonate reservoirs due to the likelihood of anhydrite precipitation and formation damage. This precipitation occurs because of the low-solubility of anhydrite at high temperature. Moreover, water dilution could decrease the scale formation while sulfate spiking might increase scale precipitation. Hence, sulfate concentration should be optimized as a wettability alteration agent to enhance oil recovery while avoid formation damage. Furthermore, as a sequence of anhydrite precipitation by sulfate spiking, oil production is expected to decrease by around 23% in the selected case study. The dissolution and precipitation mechanisms during LSWI are very case-dependent and subject of pore distribution, crude oil/brine/rock compositions, and thermodynamic conditions. Hence, the findings of this study cannot be generalized.© 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials.On hot substrates with a temperature of 100 °C, the qualities of two-dimensional perovskite PEA2MA2Pb3I10 (PEA = phenethylammonium, MA = methylammonium) films have been explored which are constructed with different spin-casting speeds. These films are performed at the speed of 1000, 2000, 4000, and 6000 revolution per minute (RPM). Below 4000 r, a higher RPM results in higher crystalline quality with more uniform morphology. Correspondingly, 4000 r devices show better performance on average (4.3% power conversion efficiency) and less hysteresis in the J-V curve than 1000 r (3.6%) and 2000 r devices (3.4%). However, for devices that were fabricated at 6000 r, inferior performance (2.8% on average) may not be predicted simply by the morphology characterization or optical measurement results at room temperature; instead, carrier trapping states can occur that result in thermally activated PL below 200 K with an activation energy of 18 meV, which do not occur in the 1000 r, 2000 r, and 4000 r films. Our results suggest that for evaluating 2D perovskite films prior to fabricating optimal devices, multiple morphology characterizations and optical measurements, including of low-temperature PL, will be helpful. Graphical Abstract: Integrated PL intensity as a function of the inverse temperature of 1000 r, 2000 r, 4000 r and 6000 r, respectively, shows that optical measurements (especially low-temperature PL) are needed if we want to directly linked the optical properties of perovskite materials to the performances of corresponding devices.

These wires interact via van der Waals forces, aggregating into 1D crystals of different shapes with desired properties. However, relevant studies on their transport properties remain limited because of the lack of high-quality samples. Herein, we report the formation of a two-dimensional (2D) carrier gas in thin, ribbon-shaped bundles of laterally assembled WTe nanowires grown by chemical vapor deposition. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal that a single WTe bundle exhibits weak antilocalization and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at low temperatures. Angle-dependent SdH oscillations serve as evidence of the realization of a 2D carrier gas in the WTe bundle. The present findings indicate the versatility of TMC nanowires as building blocks to produce electronic systems of desired dimensionality for future functional electronic and energy-harvesting devices.© 2022 Author(s).The kinetics of the transformation from the disordered to the ordered phase has been studied in Fe56Pd44 thin films deposited on silicon substrates by Joule evaporation. Subsequent thermal treatments at 550 °C in vacuum were performed at different annealing times to promote the formation and the optimization of the ordered L10 FePd phase. X-ray diffraction allowed us to investigate the microstructure of the samples (grain size, volume fraction of the transformed phase, order parameter of the ordered phase, and average order of the alloy), whereas magnetic measurements allowed us to evaluate coercivity and to independently estimate the volume fraction of the ordered L10 phase. The kinetics of the transformation turned out to reach completion after 20 min of annealing time with the grain size growing with a power law with an exponent equal to 8.24. The resulting monophasic film has a high density of defects, which contribute to the magnetic coercivity. A linear relationship between the coercive field and the average order parameter of the alloy has been established. Finally, the evolution of the transformed phase obeys Avrami's law with an exponent of ∼0.4, indicating that the transformation is controlled by the nucleation mechanism without grain growth.© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Motivated by the recent discovery of a continuous ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in CeRh6Ge4 and its distinction from other U-based heavy fermion metals such as UGe2, we develop a unified explanation of their different ground state properties based on an anisotropic ferromagnetic Kondo-Heisenberg model. We employ an improved large-N Schwinger boson approach and predict a full phase diagram containing both a continuous ferromagnetic quantum phase transition for large magnetic anisotropy and first-order transitions for relatively small anisotropy. Our calculations reveal three different ferromagnetic phases including a half-metallic spin selective Kondo insulator with a constant magnetization. The Fermi surface topologies are found to change abruptly between different phases, consistent with that observed in UGe2. At finite temperatures, we predict the development of Kondo hybridization well above the ferromagnetic long-range order and its relocalization near the phase transition, in good agreement with band measurements in CeRh6Ge4. Our results highlight the importance of magnetic anisotropy and provide a unified theory for understanding the ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion metals.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Aiming at the engineering problem of fatigue crack cracking and failure of fracturing pump valve box under multiple working conditions in actual service, taking a model of three-cylinder fracturing pump valve box as the research object, analyze its working conditions and classify typical working conditions. combined with the working principle and the work sequence of each cylinder of the crankshaft, explore the working mechanism of each cylinder under different typical working conditions, According to the actual pressure pump valve box material and finite element geometric model, the service load equivalence under different typical working conditions is determined.

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were used to estimate Estatic for carbonate formation. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to estimate Estatic for sandstone formation. In this study, the ANN design parameters were optimized using the self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) optimization algorithm. The ANN model was trained to predict Estatic from conventional well log data such as bulk density, compressional time, and shear time. 409 data points from Well-A were used to train the ANN model which was then tested using 183 unseen data from the same well and validated on 11 data points from a different well (Well-B). The developed SaDE-ANN model estimated Estatic for the training data set with a very low average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 0.46%, very high correlation coefficient (R) of 0.999 and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9978. And the Estatic values of testing data set were estimated with AAPE, R, and R2 of 1.46%, 0.998, and 0.9951, respectively. These results confirmed the high accuracy of the developed Estatic model.© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Separation and recovery of target anions from wastewater is a sustainable method for chemical production industry. In this study, the novel anion exchange membranes with high antifouling and target ion selectivity performance were designed by the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of dopamine, positive and negative polyelectrolytes under the alternating current electric field and ionic control (AC[ion]) process. The resulting membranes were fabricated with different LbL assembled multilayers to evaluate the target ion selectivity. Besides, the different LbL assembled methods, including the electrostatic deposition self-assembly (EDS), AC[Cl−] assembly and AC[NO3−] assembly methods were carried out to evaluate the ion effect in membrane assembly process on final target ion permeation rate, respectively. With the initial concentration of 50 mM of NaCl, NaNO3 and Na2SO4 in mixed solution and the constant current density of 5.00 mA cm−2 of electrodialysis, the permselectivity of resulting membrane could be enhanced by the increased multilayers. Besides, the ion control in the alternating current electric field assembly process could enhance the relevant target ion permeation rate. The increased values of membrane surface electrical resistance fouled by organic pollutants were used to evaluate the antifouling property of membranes in electrodialysis, and the resulting membranes showed a high antifouling performance. This work provided a promising membrane separation technology in target anion recovery from wastewater for sustainable development.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This book is devoted to an introductory discussion on a covariant approach to Quantum Mechanics in the framework of a curved galilean spacetime.

We investigate the extent to which this universality continues to hold beyond the Euclidean setting, taking as case studies Bernoulli bond percolation and lattice trees. We present strong numerical evidence that the critical exponents governing these models on transitive graphs of polynomial volume growth depend only on the volume-growth dimension of the graph and not on any other large-scale features of the geometry. For example, our results strongly suggest that percolation, which has upper-critical dimension 6, has the same critical exponents on Z4 and the Heisenberg group despite the distinct large-scale geometries of these two lattices preventing the relevant percolation models from sharing a common scaling limit. On the other hand, we also show that no such universality should be expected to hold on fractals, even if one allows the exponents to depend on a large number of standard fractal dimensions. Indeed, we give natural examples of two fractals which share Hausdorff, spectral, topological and topological Hausdorff dimensions but exhibit distinct numerical values of the percolation Fisher exponent τ. This gives strong evidence against a conjecture of Balankin et al. (2018 Phys. Lett. A 382, 12-19 (doi:10.1016/j.physleta.2017.10.035)).Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.The exploiting of High Resolution (HR) Pre Stack Depth Migration (PSDM) 3D seismic volumes, normally used for Oil & Gas exploration, has been pushed forward in geomorphological and geohazard risk evaluation. The novel approach proposed here allows to carry out such activities very early in respect of the standard work flow. Early awareness of critical areas turns out to be crucial in fast-tracking projects and allows a design to cost optimization. The 3D HR PSDM outputs are processed in order to generate a detailed imaging of the shallower portion of the seismic volumes. The volumes are processed at a 2 meters depth interval and converted in time (DTT). Finally, a dedicated post migration time processing sequence, followed by time-to-depth conversion, is applied to generate a Higher Resolution Volume (HRV) in depth domain. The resulting 3D volume is then analyzed to study the seabed and the sub-bottom from a geomorphological standpoint. The analyses focus on the identification and mapping of the distribution of the "areas of instability" eventually classified according to a specific KPI (Safety Factor Index in static conditions), providing a quantitative slope stability assessment of the area. The new approach has been validated comparing the DTM (Digital Topographic Model) derived from the 3D HR PSDM volume and the available MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) bathymetry. The proposed approach leads to a dramatic improvement in the detection capability, highlighting the major critical structures such as: canyon flanks, buried slides, creeps and tension cracks on the shelf break, boulders and compacted sediments, sediment banks and sediment waves reshaped by bottom currents, pockmark areas and fluid escapes, turbidity mass movements and furrows due to tectonic activities. The approach matches perfectly the detection capability of a traditional MBES approach. The described workflow is potentially highly beneficial for early de-risking assets and operations, especially for facilities installation. The proposed innovative approach allows a detailed planning of dedicated data acquisition campaigns, restricted to the most critical areas, with a tangible reduction in the turnaround times and cost savings crucial for project economics.© 2022 Author(s).The bidirectional 3 ω method is an electrothermal technique that is commonly used to obtain the thermal conductivity of materials such as liquids, biological samples, and pastes. In this work, an epoxy-based adhesive was filled with monodisperse 10 μm polymethyl methacrylate spheres coated with silver thin films (AgPS), such that a metallic network that dominated the thermal transport was formed through the composite. The bidirectional 3 ω method was used to obtain the thermal conductivity of the conductive adhesive at different volume fractions of AgPS. For 50 vol.% AgPS, corresponding to 3.4 vol.% silver, the thermal conductivity was 2.03 ± 0.21 W m-1 K-1. The results show that the thermal conductivity is strongly correlated with the AgPS volume fraction, while maintaining a volume fraction of silver far below the commercial silver paste, which has typical filler fractions of 40 vol.% silver. The results of this work were compared to thermal measurements of the same material by other techniques, and advantages and disadvantages of the methods were finally discussed.© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Powder XRD studies were conducted. The crystalline nature of the grown sample is evident from the XRD data. The grown crystals were characterized by FTIR, Raman and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The FTIR and Raman spectrum confirmed the presence of the various functional groups in the sample. From the UV-Vis studies, it is observed that the sample shows very less absorbance in the entire visible region, which makes it a potential candidate for nonlinear application. The lower cut off wavelength was calculated to be 254 nm. The estimated value of optical bandgap of the grown crystal is 4.42 eV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was done to study the thermal stability of the grown crystal. The TGA curve establishes that Lead Mandelate crystals have thermal stability upto a temperature of 210 °C. The dielectric studies of the grown crystals conducted at room temperature shows a normal dielectric behavior. The variation of dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the sample with frequency of applied field is studied. Both dielectric constant and dielectric loss is found to decrease with increase in frequency of applied field. The dielectric constant varies in the range between 21.41 and 10.53 for an applied frequency range 0.01Hz-10MHz. The conductivity of the grown crystal is observed to increase with frequency.© 2022 IEEE.Electric field measurement is widely applied in HVDC area. However, it is a challenge to measure dc electric field in ionic environment using a packaged sensor. When the sensor is packaged in an enclosure, the landing of charge particles from environment on the enclosure surface would give an off-setting electric field, and so cause measurement error. In this paper we propose a method to bias an electrically floating metal cover above the packaged sensor, to prevent ions landing on the package cover, while still being able to measure electric field external to the enclosure. Experimental results show that when the floating cover is pre-biased, ionic charge accumulation can be reduced and eliminated. The sensor sensitivity remains at 70 mV(kV/m)-1, with and without ionic charge present in the environment.© 2022 IEEE.Fast and accurate location of cable fault is the key to ensure the safe and stable operation of the cable line and improve the reliability of the power supply. The broadband impedance spectroscopy (BIS) has provided a new method for cable fault location. Based on the relative research, this paper presents a method for cable fault location on the basis of the impedance spectroscopy. An integral transform (IT) algorithm is developed to transform the frequency-dependent impedance spectroscopy to a spatial domain function, and a location function is also promoted to achieve the fault location. The validity of the method is also verified by experiments performed on 10kV XLPE cables. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can be used to locate the cable fault, and the directions for future research is also presented.© 2022 The Authors.

To target therapeutically hepatic stellate cells, vitamin A was used in amphiphilic poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) block copolymers with terminal retinoate moieties. Several POx with varying fractions of the hydrophilic block were synthesized by sequential cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-n-nonyl-2-oxazoline and 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline, followed by termination with in situ deprotonated all-trans-retinoic acid. Characterization utilizing size exclusion chromatography, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry verified the successful functionalization. Nanoparticle and micelle pairs of similar composition with and without the retinoate moieties were prepared by nanoprecipitation and emulsion techniques. Cellular uptake studies in mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing a STRA6-like receptor revealed increased uptake of the vitamin A-modified carrier when the hydrophilic POx segments were long enough to prevent the interaction of the hydrophobic retinoate moiety with the hydrophobic carrier core.© 2022 Author(s).Roger Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis states that the Weyl curvature is small at past singularities, but not at future singularities. We review the motivations for this conjecture and present estimates for the entropy of our Universe. We then extend this hypothesis to the quantum regime by demanding that the initial state of primordial quantum fluctuations be the adiabatic vacuum in a (quasi-)de Sitter space. We finally attempt a justification of this quantum version from a fundamental theory of quantum gravity and speculate on its consequences in the case of a classically recollapsing universe.© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Synthesis of Manganese dioxide (MnO2) was done by reduction of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) with aqueous sulphuric acid (H2SO4) by hydrothermal process. For making the coin cell capacitor CoO and MnO2were spin-coated on the thin copper sheet which was used as the current collector, PEDOT: PSS poly (3,4 - ethylene dioxythiophene) as electrolyte and cellulose paper as a separator. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis has been employed to study surface morphology and to confirm the formation of nanoparticles. An image analysis approach using ImageJ has been used to measure the percentage of porosity from the SEM micrographs. The parameters like specific capacitance, energy density, and power density were calculated from the CV measurements and were compared. When both electrodes are MnO2,it has a specific capacitance of 33.57 F/g, the energy density of 16.84 J/g, and power density of 4.21 W/g and when both electrodes are CoO it has a specific capacitance of 29.19 F/g, the energy density of 14.59 J/g and power density of 3.65 W/g. But one side with MnO2and the other side with CoO electrode shows a specific capacitance of 44.92 F/g, an energy density of 22.46 J/g, and a power density of 5.62 W/g.© 2022, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd.

With the advent of vehicular IoT, smart transportation systems play a vital role in today's life for the prediction of traffic flows and efficient data transfer. With the advent of machine learning algorithms, prediction of traffic flow has reached its new dimension but still usage of single model machine learning algorithms needs improvisation in terms of prediction accuracy. Hence this paper proposes the new model of predicting the traffic flows based on the hybrid optimized learning algorithm, which integrates the BAT optimized and LSTM algorithm (BAT-LSTM). First, BAT Algorithm is applied to obtain the hyper parameters of each LSTM predictor. Again, LSTM prediction is trained using the training samples obtained by the optimized BAT algorithm. More than 100 hours of real-time traffic datasets were analysed and used for evaluating the proposed hybrid algorithms, which was then experimented on SUMO with OMNET++ platforms. The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach outperformed other existing approaches in regards of accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity. It infers that the proposed approach is extraordinary performance for traffic prediction and management systems.© 2022 by the authors.

There are many microbial similarities between peri-implantitis and periodontitis but due to current laboratory techniques there are just as many differences. This review was performed to assess changes in the oral microbiota at sites with peri-implant disease, according to the state of the art. The peri-implant microbiota presents a lower microbial quality than the periodontal microbiota, becoming increasingly complex as it progresses from peri-implant mucositis to peri-implantitis. The microbial difference detected between the peri-implant and periodontal microbiota is primarily related to whole bacterial populations, rather than specific bacterial taxa. The use of probiotics could support the reduction of peri-implant pockets, in association with mechanical debridement, due to their mechanism of action of competitive inhibition for adhesion sites. The peri-implant microbiota represents a qualitatively inferior but quantitatively superior bacterial ecosystem for some bacterial genera compared to the periodontal microbiota, showing that a progression from healthy state to peri-implantitis causes changes in microbiota composition in the absence of specific disease-causing bacteria. Transcriptomics could provide useful information for the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of peri-implant pathology through knowledge of bacterial virulence factors.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, a facile hydrogen production as fuel using electrocatalysts is equally important for the development of hydrogen fuel cells technology. Among available low-cost electrocatalysts such as single atoms electrocatalysts, metal oxides, phosphides and sulfides, MN4-type molecular catalysts etc., the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based materials is found to be one of the potential electrocatalysts for ORR and hydrogen production. Because of their several merits such as (1) well-defined architecture with exact location of active sites and structure-activity relationships, (2) chemically adjustable and well-defined pore-size architecture, (3) suitably incorporation of redox-active moieties in MOFs to initiate the charge transfer to improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity, and (4) well-characterized reaction pathways. In this chapter, we highlighted the (1) engineering and effective strategies for the fabrication of MOFs-based electrocatalysts, (2) several recent advancements on MOFs-based materials for ORR as well as hydrogen production, and (3) to emphasize some future aspects from the MOFs engineering for ORR electrocatalysis.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.MXene, an emerging 2D material, has aroused great concern in the field of supercapacitors owing to its charming properties. However, the relatively low specific capacitance of pristine MXene is unsatisfactory, which is caused by the restacking issue of MXene nanosheets. In this paper, a facile and cost-effective electrostatic self-assembly followed by hydrothermal method was adopted to prepare NiCo2S4 decorated multilayer MXene nanosheets (MXene/NiCo2S4). The introduced NiCo2S4 effectively alleviates the self-restacking of MXene nanosheet and facilitates ion accessibility. Hence, the as-prepared MXene/NiCo2S4 electrode displays a maximum specific capacitance of 1211.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, surpassing the NiCo2S4 electrode (938.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and pure MXene electrode (84.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). The assembled asymmetrical supercapacitor utilizing hybrid MXene/NiCo2S4 and RGO delivers a high energy density of 38.7 Wh kg−1 and high power density of 6137 W kg−1. This work can provide a reliable reference for the synthesis of hybrid MXene/sulfide electrodes with ideal electrochemical performance.© 2022 Author(s).The distribution of asphalt mixing plant (AMP) has not been evenly distributed in Indonesia, making it difficult to process road procurement and development in areas without AMP. It is currently available on the market of cold paving hot mix Asbuton products, comprising aggregates, grain Asbutons, perennials and other additives when necessary in accordance with the requirements of the specifications, which are spread and compressed at air temperature. The hot mixing is done by fabrication then marketed in packaged form. While the spraying and compaction is done cold (air temperature), so this product can also be an alternative choice especially for road construction in areas that have limitations of asphalt mixing units such as in remote areas and small islands. This study aims to determine the effect of modified Asbuton contents on the characteristics of Marshall AC-BC (Asphalt Concrete Binder Course). The results showed that the value of Marshall stability obtained on the content of modified Asbuton content of 4.5%, 5.0%, 5.5%, 6.0%, and 6.5% of 1218.57 kg, 1415.22 kg, 2251.01 kg, 1548.67 kg, and 1243.15 kg. From this result the most optimal is the content of modified Asbuton content 5.5% and the smallest content of modified Asbuton content 4.5%. Based on the relationship between the content of modified Asbuton content and stability, it was found that the content of optimum asphalt content was at 5.5%. The value of the test results is in accordance with the specification of effective asphalt level determination by the Bina Marga Indonesia requirement.© 2022Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a versatile technique for compositional analysis for solids, liquids, or gasses. LIBS is an asset for the quantitative or qualitative analysis of resource limited materials like actinides and rare earths because it is quasi-nondestructive. Two Eu2O3 pellets were synthesized to be a test and validation set, respectively. Spectral lines identified from the National Institute of Standards and Technology database with fundamental data reported were used to form Saha-Boltzmann plots. The Saha-Boltzmann plots were used to determine the plasma temperatures and electron densities of the laser-induced plasmas for both samples. These Saha-Boltzmann plots were then used to calculate previously unreported transition probabilities associated with identified peaks. The transition probabilities presented in this paper provide the capability for calibration free LIBS to be performed more readily on europium samples and the spectroscopic analysis of stellar bodies. Eight previously unreported transition probabilities are presented in this paper; five for Eu I and three for Eu II. The transition probabilities for Eu I ranged from 0.172 to 7.38 × 107 s−1 and those for Eu II ranged from 1.56 to 6.75 × 107 s−1.© 2022, Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences.

Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the size and type of non-metallic inclusions, the elemental composition of corrosion products, and the cracking mode in the SCC zone were determined. As a part of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, during which the shape and size of grains-crystallites, crystallographic texture, atomic displacements, the Debye-Waller factor and instrumental broadening of lines using the Caliotti function for LaB6 were taken into account, parameters of the microstructure in the SCC zone were assessed. It is shown that the SCC zone is characterized by high density of introduced edge-type dislocations, strong elastic microdistortions of the crystalline lattice and a relatively small size of coherent scattering domains (CSD). It is found that the processes of texture formation in the pipeline during SCC are characterized by a set of Cube {001}<100>, Brass {110}<11−1>, Copper {112}<1−11−>, rotated copper H {001}<11−0>, Goss {001}<110> and СН {001}<21−0> orientations. It is shown that when approaching the zone where there are no SCC traces, orientations of Goss {001}<110>, Copper {112}<1−11−> and Rot G {011}<01−1> type increase and orientations of Cube {001}<100>, H {001}<11−0> and СН {001}<21−0> type decrease.© 2022 Author(s).We challenge the view that there is a basic conflict between the fundamental principles of Quantum Theory and General Relativity and, in particular, the fact that a superposition of massive bodies would lead to a violation of the Equivalence Principle. It has been argued that this violation implies that such a superposition must inevitably spontaneously collapse (like in the Diósi-Penrose model). We identify the origin of such an assertion in the impossibility of finding a local and classical reference frame in which Einstein's Equivalence Principle would hold. In contrast, we argue that the formulation of the Equivalence Principle can be generalized so that it holds for reference frames that are associated with quantum systems in a superposition of spacetimes. The core of this new formulation is the introduction of a quantum diffeomorphism to such Quantum Reference Frames. This procedure reconciles the principle of linear superposition in Quantum Theory with the principle of general covariance and the Equivalence Principle of General Relativity. Hence, it is not necessary to invoke a gravity-induced spontaneous state reduction when a massive body is prepared in a spatial superposition.© 2022 The Authors.

Despite the efforts undertaken to date, the quest of lower detection limits, higher selectivity/stability, and faster recognition still represents a main bottleneck to effectively counteract such dreadful threats. This review aims at providing a survey on the developments undertaken in chemoresistive gas sensors based on metal oxide nanosystems for CWA recognition. The sensing mechanisms proposed in the literature, as well as the main reasons underlying the performance enhancement for functionalized/composite systems, are reviewed and discussed. The work summarizes key results achieved so far, and attempts to provide guidelines to overcome the main open problems. Efforts are devoted to delivering information on material properties/performance interplay, highlighting challenges in their fabrication and functional characterization. In fact, despite the advances made, a rational design and understanding of interfacial properties, as well as a perfect control over system growth, mandatory for commercial applications, are still missing. At the conclusion, a brief outlook on development prospects for future advancements is presented, endeavoring to provide a vision on the next necessary steps for an eventual technological implementation.© 2022 by the authors.

The results show that, on average, sustainability has a positive relation to corporate performance and sustainability performance is better than corporate performance for all multinational enterprises (MNEs). In addition, we also found that corporate social responsibility (CSR) acts as a moderator in the relationship between sustainability and corporate performances. Overall, the American group leads the others in sustainability performance, followed by Asia and Europe. On the other hand, Europe has the highest score in terms of corporate performance. In terms of size, the results show that it is positively related to corporate performance. In contrast, leverage has a negative relationship with corporate performance. The findings of this research can assist inefficient MNEs in identifying areas for advancement by learning from their peers and provide perspective and insights into the plans for MNEs’ strategies and decisions in the future.© 2022The electrochemical sensors for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection have been explored and applied in the field of food safety because of the striking merits of fast detection speed, high sensitivity and easy operation. The effective electrocatalysts possessing excellent catalytic activity for electrochemical reduction of CAP are highly desirable for determination of CAP. Herein, we developed high-performance electrochemical CAP sensor based on MoS2 modified reduced graphene oxide (MoS2-rGO) hybrids, prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method. The successful deposition of MoS2 onto rGO nanosheets was confirmed by several characterizations, including X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Most importantly, the sensing performances of electrochemical CAP sensor based on MoS2-rGO hybrids are better than the sensors based on MoS2 as well as rGO, including sensitivity of 4.566 μA·μM−1·cm−2, linear range of 1–55 μM and limit of detection of 0.6 μM. The excellent sensing performances of MoS2-rGO hybrids-based CAP sensor are derived from the synergistic effects of MoS2 and rGO. As expected, rGO serves as conductive linker between electrolyte and electrode increasing electrons transfer rate. Meanwile, the deposition of MoS2 onto rGO leads to the formation of three-dimensional conductive networks further enhanced the surface active sites and electron transferring rate. For example, the MoS2-rGO-3 hybrids display large electrochemical surface area of 0.146 cm2, and low interfacial resistance of 6.2 Ω. The present protocol could be spread on synthesis of functional materials for constructing high-performance electrochemical sensors.© 2022 Author(s).Living systems are composed of molecules that are synthesized by cells that use energy sources within their surroundings to create fascinating materials that have mechanical properties optimized for their biological function. Their functionality is a ubiquitous aspect of our lives. We use wood to construct furniture, bacterial colonies to modify the texture of dairy products and other foods, intestines as violin strings, bladders in bagpipes, and so on. The mechanical properties of these biological materials differ from those of other simpler synthetic elastomers, glasses, and crystals. Reproducing their mechanical properties synthetically or from first principles is still often unattainable. The challenge is that biomaterials often exist far from equilibrium, either in a kinetically arrested state or in an energy consuming active state that is not yet possible to reproduce de novo. Also, the design principles that form biological materials often result in nonlinear responses of stress to strain, or force to displacement, and theoretical models to explain these nonlinear effects are in relatively early stages of development compared to the predictive models for rubberlike elastomers or metals. In this Review, we summarize some of the most common and striking mechanical features of biological materials and make comparisons among animal, plant, fungal, and bacterial systems. We also summarize some of the mechanisms by which living systems develop forces that shape biological matter and examine newly discovered mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to the forces they generate themselves, which are resisted by their environment, or that are exerted upon them by their environment. Within this framework, we discuss examples of how physical methods are being applied to cell biology and bioengineering.© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

BFO is synthesized using a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of bismuth subnitrate and Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate at relatively low temperature by cost-effective sol-gel method. The morphology and chemical composition of nanopowders were studied using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and EDX.

Investigation of magnetic properties was carried out at room temperature using Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) by applying maximum magnetic field up to±30 kOe. The BFO exhibited rhombohedral distorted perovskite structure at room temperature. The room temperature hysteresis loop displayed the weak ferromagnetism of BFO, which makes it a potential candidate in the area of spintronics.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Microfluidic valves are widely used in the field of microfluidics. The research on microfluidic valves plays an essential role in the development of the microfluidic field.

We have investigated the effect of eggshells, a widely available renewable material, as partial and complete replacements of petroleum-derived carbon black in natural rubber composites for automotive anti-vibration applications. At a fixed equal total filler weight, a comparable level of reinforcement was achieved at low replacements (up to 20%) of carbon black N330 with eggshell in the reference formulation. Furthermore, pairs of composites formulated for similar hardness had similar mechanical properties, improved isolation performance with very similar damping and static stiffness (Ks), despite the difference in carbon black/eggshell ratio among them. Particularly, composites made with 20 phr (parts per hundred rubber) of eggshell and 40 phr of carbon black (C40E20) had remarkable mechanical performance, better isolation at high frequencies while maintaining similar damping at low frequency and Ks compared to carbon black alone. Addition of eggshell also improved the processing of the compound and allowed for more filler to be added to the formulation, resulting in an increase in the renewable fraction in the material and a reduction in the energy required for processing. Given the large amount of filler used in automotive rubber components, even a small fraction of carbon black replacement would represent a very large environmental gain for the industry.© 2022 American Chemical Society.Influenza virus is a major cause of death on a global scale. Seasonal vaccines have been developed to combat influenza; however, they are not always highly effective. One strategy to develop a more broadly active influenza vaccine is the use of multiple rounds of layered consensus buildings to generate recombinant antigens, termed computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA). Immunization with the COBRA hemagglutinin (HA) can elicit broad protection against multiple strains of a single influenza subtype (e.g., H1N1). We formulated a COBRA H1 HA with a stimulator of interferon genes agonist cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) into a nasal gel for vaccination against influenza. The gel formulation was designed to increase mucoadhesion and nasal retention of the antigen and adjuvant to promote a strong mucosal response. It consisted of a Schiff base-crosslinked hydrogel between branched polyethyleneimine and oxidized dextran. Following a prime-boost-boost schedule, an intranasal gel containing cGAMP and model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) led to the faster generation of serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c and significantly greater serum IgG1 levels on day 42 compared to soluble controls. Additionally, OVA-specific IgA was detected in nasal, vaginal, and fecal samples for all groups, except the vehicle control. When the COBRA HA was given intranasally in a prime-boost schedule, the mice receiving the gel containing the COBRA and cGAMP had significantly higher serum IgG and IgG2c at day 41 compared to all groups, and only this group had IgA levels above the background in vaginal, nasal, and fecal samples. Overall, this study indicates the utility of an intranasal gel for the delivery of COBRAs for the generation of serum and mucosal humoral responses.© 2022 IEEE.The COVID-19 epidemic increases the uncertainty of energy demand. This paper aims to study the impact of containment measures due to the COVID-19 epidemic on the energy demand of a group of buildings in a neighborhood and evaluate the different techniques studied on thermal performance and energy savings. Indeed, this study shows the importance of using natural and recycled waste-based materials and nighttime radiative cooling during the summer period. For this purpose, a full-scale cell located in Casablanca was considered a case study to build a simulation model performed on TRNSYS, validated using the experimental results. This model is then used to impact the techniques studied on energy performance and hours of discomfort inside another cell in Marrakech. As a result, this study has shown that the passive techniques integrated into the cell, using the material based on sisal/wool nonwoven, and night-time radiative cooling during summer, reduce energy requirements compared to the reference configuration.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.With the massive use of traditional fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions are increasing, and environmental pollution is becoming an increasingly serious problem, which led to an imminent energy transition.

In this work, we are exploring the use of a social assistance robot to perform interactions with the learners in order to determine the type of their personalities and observe the psychological change of the learners during the student-robot interaction according to their personalities. To realize our study, we have deployed a model for the integration of a humanoid assistant robot in an educational environment. The assistant robot should supervise, assist, encourage, and socially interact with learners to acquire information about their personality types. The Negative Attitude Scale toward Robots (NARS) and the Myers Briggs Type Indicator MBTI personality test was used to collect the data. The results indicate the personality types of the participants that are most dominant. The results also show a positive correlation value that should not be neglected between personality type and negative attitudes towards robots. The findings of the study can be used to encourage teachers to better understand the personality type of their students so that they can integrate robots into appropriate child-robot interaction situations.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In this paper, we propose a cubic regularized Newton method for solving the convex-concave minimax saddle point problems. At each iteration, a cubic regularized saddle point subproblem is constructed and solved, which provides a search direction for the iterate. With properly chosen stepsizes, the method is shown to converge to the saddle point with global linear and local superlinear convergence rates, if the saddle point function is gradient Lipschitz and strongly-convex-strongly-concave. In the case that the function is merely convex-concave, we propose a homotopy continuation (or path-following) method. Under a Lipschitz-type error bound condition, we present an iteration complexity bound of O(ln (1 / ϵ)) to reach an ϵ-solution through a homotopy continuation approach, and the iteration complexity bound becomes O((1/ϵ)1-θθ2) under a Hölderian-type error bound condition involving a parameter θ (0 < θ< 1).© 2022The European Mini-Plate Irradiation Experiment (EMPIrE) was designed to support the development and testing of a coated uranium-molybdenum (U-Mo) dispersion fuel for the conversion of select high-performance research reactors (HPRRs) to utilize low-enriched uranium (LEU). To aid in the development of the coated fuel form, the EMPIrE test included several plate designs and irradiated them in the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at a high meat power density (∼21 kW/cm3) and to high fuel particle fission densities (∼6.4 × 1021 fissions/cm3). These conditions mimic the bounding conditions of the BR-2 reactor in Belgium, where a concurrent irradiation experiment was performed, and exceed those previously explored in dispersion U-Mo fuel plates. A local fuel swelling analysis, as determined through high-fidelity, post-irradiation mini-plate profilometry, was used along with statistical methods to non-destructively evaluate the overall performance and separate the effects of convoluted fabrication variables. While some effects observed with this non-destructive analysis were subtle, others had more significant, and possibly competing, effects on the fuel swelling behavior. These observations will be examined further with destructive examinations to more fully assess them as the fuel design is developed and qualified.© 2022 Author(s).A large rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) was always observed in the materials with anisotropic magnetisms, for example, ferromagnetism vs antiferromagnetism or paramagnetism, at different crystallographic directions. In this work, anisotropic ferromagnetic susceptibility is utilized to implement low-field (≤2 T) large RMCE in the textured polycrystalline HoB2 alloy. The x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microstructure results reveal that the arc-melted HoB2 exhibits preferred grain orientation along the solidification direction. The measured rotating magnetic entropy changes (-ΔSR) and refrigeration capacity are 6.27 J/kg K and 73.7 J/kg, respectively, under the magnetic field change of 1 T. They are comparable with those of other materials contributed by anisotropic magnetisms. Our results suggest that the polycrystal HoB2 alloy is a promising material for practical application of magnetic refrigeration based on RMCE.© 2022 IEEE.In recent years, self-driving systems have smoothly penetrated several sectors, including precision farming.

The experimental results show that our system provides adequate localization accuracy for agricultural robots.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.To resolve the dilemma between impact resistance and structural stiffness of fan containment casing of modern civil aeroengines, a novel composite structure (CS) is proposed. It combines the hard and stiff ceramic which layered at the impact side and the lightweight and tough polymeric matrix composites (PMC) on the back side. The new structure was tested under ballistic impact loadings and quasi-static four-point bending. The results indicate that the impact resistance of the new structure is improved, compared with the PMC-only samples. Meanwhile, the bending stiffness of the new structure is also substantially larger at the cost of much lower bending strength.© 2022 The Society of Manufacturing EngineersThis paper preliminarily designs array nozzles according to different nozzle processing time and flow requirements, and analyzes the pressure distribution and fluid velocity of different combination array nozzles by using flow field simulation. It is found that the array hole nozzles 5 × 5 and 10 × 10 can remove materials evenly during the actual process without damaging the surface of the workpiece. In addition, fused quartz is processed by using nano-SiO2 jet polishing. As the removal depth increased, the width to depth ratio gradually increased from 3.34 to 4.71, while the damage threshold also gradually increased from 5.56 J/cm2 to 6.78 J/cm2. Experimental results show that nano-SiO2 jet polishing can indeed blunt scratches and improve the laser damage ability of fused quartz.© 2022 IEEE.Nowadays, online news plays an important role in people's decisions and behaviors. Some of this news shared on the web may contain deceptive in-formation to mislead those peoples which may cause uncertainty and confusion such in election choices and purchasing decision. Thereafter, fake news is becoming a trending area of research. However, fake news can be differentiated into several subcategories, such as fake reviews, Propaganda, Ru-mor, spams etc. In this paper, fake news studies are analyzed and classified based on their focus areas, this helps to understand that which fake news areas have higher concentrations of research efforts and which area requires the research attention.

Some therapeutic strategies for this pathology focus on natural compounds, such as flavonoids, because of their antimicrobial and antiviral properties. However, the therapeutic efficacy of these active compounds is limited by their low bioavailability. In this paper, composite systems consisting of the flavonoid and a carrier were produced by Supercritical Assisted Atomization to increase these compounds’ dissolution rate. Luteolin, rutin, and naringenin were selected as model flavonoids, and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and polyvinylpyrrolidone were chosen as the carriers. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was the most suitable carrier, in terms of recovery, morphology/size of the particles, and dissolution rate of the active compound. At the best operating conditions, the dissolution rate of the active principle is speeded for all the flavonoids: in particular, if compared to the virgin materials, it is 55.8 times faster for luteolin, 3.1 times faster for rutin and 3.4 times faster for naringenin.© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis research is focused on the evaluation method of failure risk of prestressed anchor cable, and an accurate evaluation method with a simple operation is proposed. The analytic hierarchy process are used to determine the weight of each evaluation element, the closeness degree of each indicator is determined based on ideal point method. The results show the following: (1) the evaluation method better integrates the effects of multiple factors on the failure risk of the prestressed anchor cable, and the evaluation results are accurate and consistent with the actual situation of the project; (2) the evaluation result is intuitive, and the correlation degree obtained can not only reflect the failure risk grade of prestressed anchor cable, but also the possibility of deterioration of the failure risk of the evaluated anchor cable to a higher level could be obtained; and (3) the rationality and practicability is verified by comparison with field situation and other several methods. In addition, this method has good applicability in solving the other uncertain problems.© 2022 by the authors.

The ported shroud was developed specifically to extend the operating limit. It is a passive flow control device based on a cavity for flow recirculation to avoid blade passage blocking in near surge conditions. A CFD simulation campaign using a simplified model identified the differences in the performance of the centrifugal compressor with ported shroud, compared to the baseline case. The use of a stability criterion to determine the limit mass flow rate, developed in a previous study by the authors, highlighted and quantified the extension of the surge margin in the case with ported shroud for different rotational speeds. An increase in the surge margin of 11% was detected at design speed, but with a lower trend at higher speeds. An in-depth flow analysis showed the main physical mechanisms in the compressor that occur for different operating conditions: at near surge conditions the cavity recirculates the low momentum flow located in the inducer region; it re-energizes the mainstream decreasing the circumferential velocity component; an improvement of up to 7% of the pressure ratio was obtained. Instead, at best efficiency conditions the flow recirculation worsens the performance by reducing the flow incidence at the rotor leading edge. Finally, using unsteady simulations with a complete 3D model and with the application of the stability criterion it was possible to confirm that the ported shroud can effectively extend the operating range.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Several techniques have been applied to improve fluid conformance of injection wells to increase water flooding performance and eventually field oil recovery. Normal outflow control devices (OCDs) are effective solutions for this problem in reservoirs with static properties, however, they fail in reservoirs with complex/dynamic properties including growing fractures. There, the continuously increasing contrast in the injectivity of a section with the fractures compared to the rest of the well causes diverting a great portion of the injected fluid into the thief zone thus creating short-circuit to the nearby producer wells. A new autonomous outflow control device (AOCD) has been developed recently to choke the injection fluid into the propagating fractures crossing the well autonomously after reaching a designed flowrate thus maintaining a balanced/prescribed injection distribution. This work focuses on modelling design workflow to find the optimum completion design and demonstrates its added value through an extensive dynamic reservoir simulation study. Like other OCDs, this device should be installed in several zones in the injection well. The device is a bi-stable flow control device with two operating conditions, one, devices operate as normal passive OCDs initially, and two, if the injected flowrate flowing through the valve exceeds a designed limit, the device will automatically shut off. This allows the denied fluid to that specific zone to be distributed among the neighbouring zones. This performance enables the operators to minimise the impacts of thief zones on the injected fluid conformance and to react to a dynamic change in reservoirs properties specifically the growth of fractures. This also reduces the injection cost and improving the reliability of the injection well systems. A sector reservoir-model coupled with a Geomechanics model via commercial reservoir simulation software was established to study the impacts of temperature and flowrate of injection fluids on the performance of injection wells completed with various completions. The simulation study showed less imposed pressure and much more efficient fluid conformance and fracture growth was delivered with the new device compared to various other completions. The results showed how the new device may change the sequence of thermal fractures initiation and the extends of their growth. This autonomously reactive control on the injection fluid conformance resulted in an increased sweep and ultimate oil recovery (up to 20%) while reducing the total volume of injected fluid (by 30%), so significantly increased field NPV. This study illustrates how efficiently the new injection valve chokes/restricts water into dynamic thief zones in a reservoir. This new device is autonomous and reacts to the rate of fluid passing through and eliminates the cost of alternative techniques including running PLT and following intervention actions.© 2022 Author(s).Suppose the set W = {s1, s2,⋯, sk} is a subset of the vertex set V(G). The representation of a vertex v of G with respect to W as follows rm(v|W) = { d(v, s1), d(v, s2), ⋯, d(v, sk)} where d(v, si),1 ≤ i ≤ k is the distance between the vertex v with the vertices of set W together with their multiplicities. The set W is called the m-local resolving set of G if every two adjacent vertices of G have distinct representation with respect to W. If G has an m-local resolving set, then an m-local resolving set having minimum cardinality is called a local multiset basis and its cardinality is called the local multiset dimension of G, denoted by mdl (G). We say that G has an infinite local multiset dimension and we write mdl(G) = ∞. In this paper, we determine the local multiset dimension of related cycle graphs namely kayak paddles graph, and cycles with chord.© 2022 by the authors.

When scalar meteorological parameters have been considered, the focus has most often centered on temperature changes. A subset of these works has also considered humidity to various extents. These limited investigations are complemented by just a few studies dedicated to analyzing humidity changes. With onshore wind turbines often sited in agricultural areas, any changes to the microclimate surrounding a turbine can impact plant health and the length of the growing season; any changes to the environment around an offshore wind farm can change cloud and fog formation and dissipation, among other impacts. This article provides a review of observational field campaigns and numerical investigations examining changes to humidity within wind turbine array boundary layers. Across the range of empirical observations and numerical simulations, changes to humidity were observed in stably stratified conditions. In addition to the role of atmospheric stability, this review reveals that the nature of the change depends on the upstream moisture profile; robustness of the mixing; turbine array layout; distance from the turbine, in all three directions; and vertical temperature profile.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Dong, Lin, Zhang and Wang.Recombinant protein production by mammalian cells is the initial step in the manufacture of many therapeutic proteins. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most common host system to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins (RTPs). However, it is still challenging to maintain high productivity ensuring the good quality of RTPs produced by CHO cells. MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are short regulatory non-coding RNAs that can regulate cellular behavior and complex phenotypes. It has been found that miRNAs can enhance the expression level of recombinant proteins in CHO cells by promoting proliferation, resisting apoptosis, and regulating metabolism. miRNAs also can affect the quality of RTPs. In this review, we will discuss the effect and mechanism of miRNA on the expression level and quality of recombinant proteins in CHO cells.© 2022 IEEE.This paper deals with an enhanced Direct Torque Control strategy for induction motor drive. The proposed approach uses a more precise switching table based on twelve sectors and modified hysteresis controllers. Processor In the Loop technique is performed using MATLAB with Code Composer Studio and F28069M development board. Therefore, this work proposes an experimental validation of an enhanced algorithm for Direct Torque and flux Control. Also, it offers a comparison to the conventional Direct Torque Control strategy. Processor In the Loop results, show that modified Direct Torque Control strategy improves torque and flux dynamic and enhances waveforms quality. So flux and torque ripples and harmonic distortion of the currents are reduced.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.The stiffening finishing of cotton fabrics has been widely used in textile industry. However, the notorious softening of stiffened fabrics attenuated the stiffening style during storage. To reveal crucial factors responsible for the softening phenomenon and elucidate the mechanism, cotton twill woven fabrics finished with polyacrylates (PAcr) stiffening agents were systematically analyzed. The sensitive index to stiffening effect, i.e. stiffness value, was found which can fully assess the handle changes of stiffened fabrics. The stiffness value of stiffened cotton fabrics decreased rapidly in the initial stage of storage, and the declining extent was related to the hygroscopic behavior of stiffened fabrics. Based on the hygroscopic kinetic data, hygroscopic-drying cyclic experiments, and morphology characterization, it was found that interfaces between cotton fibers and stiffening agent film were maintained during the whole hygroscopic process, and the reason for handle changes of stiffened cotton fabrics was ascribed to the reversible moisture-induced plasticization effect on PAcr stiffening agent film and cotton fibers. Furthermore, the underlying softening mechanism was further proposed in this work. Collectively, the present results are crucial for anti-softening in stiffening finishing of hydrophilic fabrics and an important part for the research on the mechanism of softening of stiffened fabrics.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.To set the on-off mode for efficient automatic heat regulation of a smart base layer, this study determined whether the location of the temperature input sensors for automatic heat regulation and the temperature range set for on-off was adequate in a particular environment-clothing-body system. The experimental environment was set to both neutral (23.0±1.0 °C, 20±5 % RH) and cold (5±0.5 °C, 45±5 % RH, wind velocity: 0.2 m/s). With eight male subjects wearing T-shirts and outerwear over smart base layers, both their skin temperatures and the clothing microclimate temperatures were measured when the heating unit was in operation. Wearability was thus assessed, thereby allowing an examination of the relationship between the temperature values of the input sensor and those of the heating unit. In this context, we set the reference value of the fabric-covered sensor to 34 °C and sewed the operating portion of the heat-generating pad into the inner side of the back area of the base layer. When the heating unit temperature was set to 34 °C, the clothing microclimate temperature changed in response to changes in the external environmental temperature; this was detected by the temperature sensor attached to the heating unit of the smart base layer. Thus, in both environments, the back area skin temperature was maintained almost consistently within the upper limit (38.4±2.0 °C) of the skin temperature comfort zone. As a result of examining the temperature changes according to the layering structure of clothing where the heat-generating device was attached, the location where temperature sensor A was embedded to receive the input signal within the heating unit and the set point reflected the effects of the environmental temperature, body temperature, and clothing in balance, thereby demonstrating its suitability for automatic heat regulation input signals. Here, the overall thermal sensation was 1.3–2.0 points and thus somewhat warm; overall comfort was also higher than average, at 6.4–7.3 points. In sum, neither the overall thermal sensation or comfort level substantially changed when moving to low-temperature indoor environments after wearing the automatic heat-regulating smart base layer. We therefore established that the body comfort zone was adequately maintained in both given environments when the operating portion of the device was embedded into the base layer of the three-layer clothing system and while the reference value of the sensor temperature was set.© 2022 IEEE.Recently, several 'smart classroom' architectures have been developed with its specific architecture, most of which are general architectures for teaching and distance learning. Therefore, there is a dire need, as a particular challenge, to model and develop a generic architecture that should integrate into particular features of adaptive e-learning in a single model. This latter aims at making the system more efficient and helpful to learners to advance and complete their learning courses successfully while exploiting the traceability and history of the activities taught. The data related to each learner and the trainer was also exploited to predict the optimal and automatic choice of the learning path to be taken. Today, this challenge is now possible thanks to the rapid evolution of Information and Communication Technologies for Education (ICTE), where a new concept of the Internet has emerged under the name Internet of Things (IoT). This has allowed the development and exploitation of the concept of 'intelligent environments' in an educational process, considering the specific aspects of this process (face-to-face education, virtual education, self-training, etc.), into a single model. This was achieved while personalizing the educational content based on the specific needs of the learner specifically putting the latter in the heart of the learning process as the main actor.© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Low-dimensional perovskite halides have shown a great potential as X-ray detection materials because of efficient exciton emissions originating from strongly spatially localized charge carriers. Nonetheless, most of them have a scintillation yield far below their theoretical limits. Here, it is found that the harvesting efficiency of produced charge carriers can be significantly enhanced via a small amount of In+ doping in these highly localized structures. A bright and sensitive zero-dimensional Cs3Cu2I5:In+ halide with efficient and tunable dual emission is reported. The radioluminescence emission of Cs3Cu2I5:In+ crystals under X-ray excitation consists of a self-trapped exciton emission at 460 nm and an In+-related emission at 620 nm at room temperature. In+ doping enhances the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of Cs3Cu2I5 from 68.1% to 88.4%. Benefiting from the higher PLQY, Cs3Cu2I5:In+ can achieve an excellent X-ray detection limit of 96.2 nGyair s−1, and a superior scintillation yield of 53 000 photons per MeV, which is comparable to commercial CsI:Tl single crystals. As a result, a remarkable X-ray imaging resolution of 18 line pairs mm–1 is demonstrated, which is so far a record resolution for single crystal perovskite-based flat-panel detectors. These results highlight the importance of efficient harvesting of carriers (and excitons) in low-dimensional perovskites for radiation detection applications.© 2022, American Foundry Society.The influence of sodium on the microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties of die-cast Al–Si–Cu–Mg (ADC12) alloy has been examined experimentally. Mechanical properties of the die-cast Al–Si–Cu–Mg alloy have increased with the addition of 0.03% Na, because of modification of the shape of the Si eutectic particles from acicular to fine and fibrous appearing. However, the mechanical properties decreased when 0.04% Na or more was added, due to the formation of shrinkage porosity. The fine and fibrous appearing eutectic Si has been created by the interruption of the nucleation and growth of Si eutectic by Na. The mechanical properties of Na containing die-cast ADC12 alloy were further enhanced by a T5 treating which is a low-temperature aging, giving rise to significant precipitation of fine CuAl2 and Mg2Si. In contrast, the mechanical properties of die-cast ADC12 T6-treated samples were lower due to the formation of blister defects. Thus, the solid solution process in the T6 treatment may not make severe precipitation hardening of die-cast ADC12 due to overaging. Moreover, severe precipitation hardening occurred by the artificial aging after microstructural refinement by Na.© 2022 IEEE.Physical Distancing is one of the minimum health protocols where two persons should be at least 1.5 meters apart to lessen the risk of transmission of COVID-19. The study aims to design a real-time monitoring system that detects violations on physical Distancing by applying the You Only Look Once version 4 computer vision model. The program detects the pairwise distance between two persons in a frame and indicates whether they comply with the minimum 1.5 distance between persons. The video frame comprises zone 1 being the farthest from the camera, zone 2, and zone 3 being the nearest from the camera. The program calculates the Euclidean distance between persons and generates a pixel value converted to a metric value by a scale multiplier. The scaling multiplier varies depending on the zone at which the location of the detected person is. The mean absolute error of the distance predicted by the program is at 7.8 centimeters, 5.73 centimeters, and 5.21 centimeters at zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The physical distancing detector achieved 95.84% accuracy and 97.08% precision upon evaluating through the confusion matrix.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.The paper gives an overview of recent issues in Oil & Gas material selection, as resistance to high levels of H2S, and quality control during production of Carbon Steel and Clad pipes for pipelines, with reference to real cases. Each topic under discussion is first described showing the relevant issues in terms of materials available on the market, failure mechanisms and possible consequences during the service life. Then the challenges are analyzed by mean of a brief review based on the main and most recent corrosion related conferences. Then, making reference to case histories taken from recent offshore development projects, the Company experience is described, highlighting the technical solutions taken and the main results obtained. The first challenge discussed is the corrosion resistance of pipeline materials for transportation of fluids with high levels of H2S. The carbon steel pipes used for large diameters pipes are commonly manufactured with the TMCP, Thermo-Mechanical Controlled Process method. In severe sour service applications they showed to be susceptible to SSC, Sulfide Stress Cracking, due to hard zones that can originate at surface during pipe manufacturing. New non-destructive tests have been developed for the detection of hard zones during pipe production. Besides, SSC tests have been performed on API 5L X52 and X60 pipes samples at H2S partial pressure higher than 10 bar, which gave surprising results. Clad and lined pipes represent alternative materials to TMCP carbon steel, but they are expensive and only few manufacturers are available, with consequence in terms of long delivery time. Furthermore, these materials are not immune to technical problems, as the precipitation of intermetallic phases in the nickel alloy layer during heat treatment. The paper describes the Company experience made in offshore projects where both TMCP carbon steel and clad pipes have been used for pipelines and buckle arrestors. The corrosion and cracking problems described in the paper are relatively new, as well as the technical solutions adopted. New field experience represents additive information to existing literature.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.With the miniaturization of airborne system, heat dissipation has become a critical issue. Since sinusoidal channel can enhance flow disturbance, it has a stronger heat exchange capacity than that of straight channel. However, flow boiling characteristics in sinusoidal channel are more complex. Here, numerical simulations of flow boiling in sinusoidal and straight microchannels are conducted based on the VOF model with the inner diameter of 1 mm, mass flux of 500 kg/m2 s and heat flux of 50 kW/m2. The effects of channel structure and hypergravity are obtained. The simulation results indicate that bubble evolution in sinusoidal channel is more complex than that in straight channel, and bubbles are more likely to coalesce, deform and break. Vortices appear in sinusoidal channel and disrupt the near-wall boundary layer. Bubble evolution combined with vortices affect the flow boiling performances. For straight channel, dryout is less likely to occur, while for sinusoidal channel, it is more likely due to more drastic flow changes. Furthermore, the transition of flow patterns is faster under hypergravity. For sinusoidal channel, flow patterns transform earlier into slug and circular flows.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Deep tight gas fields in Northern Oman are often compared to and approached with unconventionals due to their tight matrix properties and the necessity of employing hydraulic fracturing to deliver productivity. Complicated by operational constraints and field histories, hydraulic fracture effectiveness – how fracture stimulation delivers relative to how much matrix flow contributes to production – remains a puzzle and a challenge. This further affects how to optimize existing completion and stimulation strategy in order to improve the value proposition. In this study, we review the fracture and production performance of a mature gas field in Northern Oman. Integrating data of various technical disciplines, we re-examine a wealth of cumulative field data over two decades of operations with an aim to identify the key enablers for fracture placement and production. With integration of reservoir properties, geomechanics, and time-lapse production profiles, we identify that geomechanics plays a key role in controlling reservoir fraccability and the placement of hydraulic fractures. While hydraulic fracture containment within the Barik formation has been well recognized and considered a given in multi-staged fractured vertical wells, the creation of fracture heights is found dependent on the in-situ stress conditions and pumping metrics, which further links to productivity. Such inter-relationship could potentially be utilized to optimize fracture performance by a refined placement strategy. With big data, the common technical opinions that normally arise from a deterministic approach on limited data can be better visualized and addressed. The statistical strength of the analysis leads to improved understanding of the subsurface complexity, interaction of reservoir quality with completion design, and a suite of future optimization opportunities.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.As the emerging cloud computing technologies become more widespread and intensive, the attention to energy consumption to the underpinning network and resources grows rapidly. This happens because the transmission and switching networks are the key for user connectivity to the cloud and give unlimited infrastructures to the users without sharing obligations to manage them. Hence, cloud computing service providers are facing challenges to exploit resources wisely and get the best revenues accordingly. This leads to task scheduling approaches with their associated algorithms that aim to minimize energy consumptions in a cloud environment. This chapter reviews the concept of task scheduling approaches and focuses on the strategies to improve energy efficiency that is meant for cloud computing data centers. Extensive experiments were conducted by researchers to compare the earlier scheduling approaches such as earlier deadline first (EDF), round robin (RR), and greedy with the enhanced algorithms that equipped with strategies to customize resources based on workload and total utility. The results show that the processing time of the enhanced algorithm is significantly improved and reduce the total energy consumption in cloud computing data center.© 2022 American Chemical Society.Developing highly sensitive and stable surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe systems is an actively pursued goal in sensors and diagnostics. In this study, we present silica-coated core-satellite (CS@SiO2) plasmonic nanoparticle assembly structures that potentially realize this goal. We assemble different-sized gold nanoparticles into core-satellite (CS) configurations using dithiol molecular linkers that also serve as SERS labels. Multiple hot spots in the CS structure and narrow nanogaps in each hot spot produce a significantly enhanced Raman scattering signal with an enhancement factor of ∼8 × 107. Various types of molecules can be inserted into the nanogaps using the mixed self-assembled monolayers with alkanedithiol, enabling multiplex detection. Silica encapsulation of the CS nanoassemblies stabilizes the particles and makes it easy to modify the surface to attach antibodies or DNAs. Many properties of the CS@SiO2, including a wide range of optical resonances, scalability using multiple glass slides, long-term stability in ethanol, and single-particle-level sensitivity, make the material an ideal SERS probe for sensitive and multiplexed detection of diseases and viruses.© 2022 by the authors.

The frequency dependence of dielectric response to the bias electric field opens a brand new window for the study of this problem. A novel model from mesoscopic to macroscopic, revealing the relationship between the dielectric permittivity to the applied electric field, temperature, and PNRs, was established based on mean field approximation and the theory of continuum percolation, and not only validates the field-induced percolation and the relaxation time divergency at the freezing temperature, but also predicts the frequency dependence of dielectric response. Unexpectedly, the model reveals the field-enhanced correlation length results in the nonmonotonic behavior of dielectric response, and implies that the increased orientation consistency of dipolar clusters and coercive fields originated from inherent inhomogeneity slow down the relaxation time of PNR reorientation. Considering the multi-scale heterogeneity of PNRs in relaxor, we found that the increased heterogeneity degree reduces the dielectric permittivity, but changes the slope of dielectric response to the bias electric field.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The aircraft structure would be suffered high temperature during the hypersonic flight. To solve the problem of high temperature resistance of hypersonic aircraft, the mechanical properties of different structural materials at different temperatures are studied. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of structural steel, aluminum alloy, titanium alloy, resin matrix composites and polyimide composites are analyzed, and the performance of the materials at high temperature is compared. The results show that the properties of typical materials will decrease with the increase of temperature. The high-temperature mechanical properties of structural steel and aluminum alloy are poor, and the titanium alloy can withstand higher temperature. Polyimide resin composites can work at higher temperature for a long time compared with epoxy resin and bismaleimide resin composites, and it has more obvious advantages than titanium alloy at 400 °C. Polyimide resin composite has great potential to replace traditional materials as load-bearing structural material of hypersonic aircraft.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The results of modeling a finite system of interacting two-dimensional electrons placed at zero temperature into an external parabolic potential well are presented.

As a continuation of the study, we synthesized a series of PAK copolymers to investigate the structure-property relationship of PAK on the IRI activity and its mechanism by varying the (1) composition of the l-alanine/l-lysine (A/K) ratio among 0/100, 50/50, 60/40, and 70/30 and (2) molecular weight of PAK among 4, 9, and 15 kDa at a fixed 50/50 ratio of A/K. As the hydrophobic l-alanine composition of PAK increased from 0 to 70%, the mean largest grain size (MLGS) relative to phosphate-buffered saline decreased from 74 to 11% at 1.0 mg/mL. As the molecular weight of PAK increased from 4 to 15 kDa, the MLGS decreased from 32 to 15% at 1.0 mg/mL. The ice nucleation temperature decreased as the hydrophobic l-alanine composition and the molecular weight of PAK increased. The thermal hysteresis (TH) of PAK was about 0.05 °C at 1.0 mg/mL and increased to 0.2 °C as the molecular weight increased from 4 to 15 kDa. The ice crystal size of ice cream showed a similar trend to IRI activity. To understand the underlying chemistry of the IRI effect of PAK, circular dichroism spectroscopy, a dynamic ice shaping study, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were carried out. These studies suggest that the α-helicity, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, molecular weight of PAK, and extent of interactions between polymers and ice crystals are related to the IRI activity, which extends to ice nucleation inhibition, TH of ice formation, ice shaping, and even the ice crystal size of ice cream.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.In mature fields developed by water flooding, oil companies keep trying to fight premature water encroachment in producing wells caused by heterogeneous reservoir permeability and non-uniform displacement front advance. Changes in pressure gradients and flow rates and increased effects of adsorptive, osmotic and capillary forces result in significantly reduced oil permeability and low production from low-permeability intervals. The chemical technology has been developed for the combined effect of selective water shut-off and change of rock properties from water wet to oil wet or visa versa to form a new phase on the rock surface, which produces significant excess energy used to recover residual oil. The effectiveness of this technology has been tested in a reservoir modelling laboratory by studying the compatibility between the agents employed and reservoir fluids and flow tests conducted on three areal heterogeneous reservoir models. Tests have shown that the agents used in the technology retain their functionality at high temperatures of up to 120°C and a formation water salinity of 10–127 g/l with no adverse effect on oil quality. The ultrafine reagent reducing interfacial tension at the oil-water interface under reservoir conditions to 0.005 mN/m was studied in the laboratory. Geological and production data show that the main problem of the pilot areas is early encroachment of production wells by injected water because of its breakthrough and subsequent unwanted flow through the most permeable and depleted layers. Tracer studies, conducted in injection wells using tracers that moved through flushed channels towards wells with high production rates and high-water cuts, identified zones of ineffective injection. Treatments using multi-action technology in four pilot areas of the field produced the following effects: 1. Redistribution of injected water flows by increasing the residual resistance factor in high-permeability zones and redirection of flows into previously inactive reservoir zones. 2. Incremental oil production from four areas over 10 months was 2745 tonnes with a lasting effect. The novelty of the multi-action technology consists in targeted treatment of oil reservoirs and displacement of residual oil through selective isolation of water-encroached zones. The energy produced at the phase interface is used to separate film-bound oil, move globular oil through pore throats and increase oil flow rate and oil permeability in the reservoir irrespective of its geological and mineralogical characteristics or formation fluid properties.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.This paper deals with problem of control under disturbance where dynamics of control system is fully nonlinear. Formulation of the problem follows first player’s problem in Krasovskii–Subbotin framework for the differential games. In a single cubic grid of time-state space the value function and the control values are simultaneously calculated, based on minmax structure with the use of multilinear interpolation. The control function at each instant of temporal partition is constructed by constant interpolation of the control values calculated at spatial nodes in the same instant. Convergence of the approximation scheme to the value function and universal suboptimality of the proposed feedback control are shown. Through several examples, the correctness of the schemes is illustrated.© 2022 The Authors.

In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion-type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent-ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent-ion batteries.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.The scope of this paper is to share technical knowledge and experience gained on the use of non-metallic materials in off-shore environments. The proposed applications lead to the highest benefit level in terms of maintenance interventions as well as to weaknesses jeopardizing the productivity. In particular, we evaluated the use of: • Glass-reinforced composite material in offshore platform boat landing and stairs, instead of galvanized grating; • Glass-reinforced epoxy pipe for offshore firefighting network; • Plastic reinforcement sleeve on the protection of tube bundle heat exchanger welding. Analysis was carried out on obtained results. The approach took into consideration the technical results after long period of installation in a boat landing and firefighting network offshore with averse environmental conditions, while for the plastic sleeve it was a proactive action against failure and the relevant study of consequences in case of removal. Present paper is not an innovative implementation but it is born from the daily offshore plant observation with the particular aim to improve the asset integrity trying to guarantee the best performance, reducing maintenance and restoration cost. Positive and negative results on the above applications will be mentioned to permit as final conclusion a proper material selection and design accuracy for future application.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The Michelson-Morley experiment (MME) is still important to physics, and not just to the history of physics. The hypothesis of contraction of bodies in the direction of their motion arose as an ad hoc hypothesis about the "contraction"of the Michelson's interferometer arm in the direction of its motion. Even today this experiment is the "strongest argument"of this hypothesis, and of time dilation too. This work will present the explanation of the MME through five methods. The first method can be called the traditional method, which was applied by Michelson, but not correctly. The other methods are the explanation of the MME with the interferometer located at an acute angle to the direction of Earth's motion; with the light clock; using Galilean transformation in polar coordinates and using the Doppler effect formula. All these methods give the same solution, and this solution is in accordance with the experiment's result. Solutions derived from these five methods represent a natural explanation for the result of the MME-without weird terms and without unscientific assumptions.© 2022 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.We investigate how large-scale cosmic filaments impact the quenching of galaxies within one virial radius of 324 simulated clusters from The Three Hundred project. We track cosmic filaments with the versatile, observation-friendly program DisPerSE and identify haloes hosting galaxies with VELOCIRaptor. We find that cluster galaxies close to filaments tend to be more star forming, bluer, and contain more cold gas than their counterparts further away from filaments. This effect is recovered at all stellar masses. This is in stark contrast with galaxies residing outside of clusters, where galaxies close to filaments show clear signs of density related pre-processing. We first show that the density contrast of filaments is reduced inside the intra-cluster medium. Moreover, examination of flows around and into cluster galaxies shows that the gas flows in intra-cluster filaments are colder and tend to stream along with galaxies in their midst, partially shielding them from strangulation by the hot, dense intra-cluster medium. This also preserves accretion on to satellites and limit ram pressure.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Subsurface gas storage is a strategic tool used to balance seasonal sales gas supply and demand fluctuations. Developing and managing gas storage reservoirs requires the application of standard reservoir engineering tools and practices; however, a number of additional challenges are specific to Underground Gas Storage (UGS). This paper addresses these challenges and present both modelling, design, and operational solutions. There are important considerations and challenges that can be associated with areas such as reservoir selection, surface-subsurface modelling, and optimum number of wells with the best design in gas storage reservoirs. Nevertheless, operational challenges can also be very critical and lead to jeopardizing the success of the project, if not mitigated properly. Due to the cyclic nature of gas storage during injection and reproduction, cyclic stress effects can be a concern and should be studied via appropriate geomechanical models and laboratory tests (Thick-Walled-Cylinder) to address any imapct on wellbore stability and potential sand/solid production. Although mature gas reservoirs are good candidates for underground gas storage, drilling any new wells can be challenging and has to be addressed using state of the art technologies such as managed-pressure-drilling (MPD) or under-balance-coiled-tubing drilling (UBCTD). The well completion in terms of material selection and design will also impact the workover frequency and productivity/injectivity of the gas storage wells. As such, accurate evaluation of flow assurance and completion accessories are essential to ensure long term suitability of the gas storage wells. Last but not least, due to the lean nature of the gas in these developments, the risk of hydrates formation is very likely and should be analyzed and mitigated with the right engineering tools. This work presents the basic theory and applications of the above-mentioned methods and evaluations with the ultimate goal of proposing general guidelines for the development of UGS. The results and interpretations of geomechanical modelling and laboratory testing are presented as well as the drilling design and its challenges. Well integrity and erosional velocity assessment are discussed as part of the flow assurance as well as hydrates formation envelopes and its prediction methods. Gas storage projects are strategic for gas operating companies and require careful planning and economic feasibility evaluation. The challenges and lessons learnt, discussed in this paper, are required to guarantee the success of such initiative.© 2022 Author(s).In this paper we review the performance of M/G/1 queueing systems. These systems refer to those systems in which the arrivals are generated by a Poisson process but the service time is permitted to be non-exponential distribution. Note that M/G/1 assumes no explicit distribution for the service time but assume that the service times of all customers be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d). Feature of actual situation in many practical scenarios often follows M/G/1 model. For example when a service station fails and needs repairs, then the amount of time needed to finish the job has a general distribution. Through traditional approach, the steady state or transient solutions were either in terms of Laplace-Stieltjes transforms (LSTs) or other integrals, so that inversion was required to get the probabilities of interest. For general service distributions and complex queuing scenarios, even with the current computing power the inversions are complicated and intractable. Avoiding such problems the discrete time queueing has been applied to derive the solutions. Furthermore, one can use lattice path combinatorics to study queuing processes using limiting process. Lattice paths approach was modified on deriving the busy period density function without using limiting process. The system probabilities obtained in this case are in explicit closed forms that are straight forward to compute.© 2022 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.Quasi-stationary density wave theory predicts the existence of an age gradient across the spiral arms with a phase crossing at the corotation radius. We have examined evidence for such age gradients using star formation history (SFH) maps derived from lightning, a spectral energy distribution fitting procedure, and by using spatially resolved stellar clusters. Three galaxies from the LEGUS survey were used to analyse the azimuthal offsets of spatially resolved stellar clusters. Kernel density estimation plots of azimuthal cluster distance offsets reveal prominent central peaks and secondary peaks on the positive side, relative to the density wave for NGC 5194 and NGC 5236. These secondary downstream peaks in the cluster distributions show overall evidence for an age gradient. NGC 628 shows secondary peaks on both sides of the density wave. The cluster distributions also show an increasing spatial spread with age, consistent with the expectation that they were born in the density wave. SFH maps of 12 nearby galaxies were analysed using spirality, a matlab-based code, which plots synthetic spiral arms over FITS images. The SFH maps reveal a gradual decrement (tightening) in pitch angles with increasing age. By analysing the pitch angle differences between adjacent age bins using the error function, the average of the probabilities shows a 69 per cent ± 25 per cent chance that the pitch angle values decrease (tighten) with increasing age. Thus, we see a tightening of the spiral pattern in galaxies, both when segregating stellar populations specifically by age or more generally by colour, as was shown in our previous studies.© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Horizontal wells with multiple perforated fracturing is main method to improve well production in the tight formation. However, hydraulic fracture morphology remains obscure because of different horizontal stress contrast, wellbore direction, and pump rate, resulting in no guidance for perforation parameters design. To uncover the mask, a perforated wellbore fracturing model is established based on the continuous damage theory, combing with field data to investigate the effects of above three factors on hydraulic fracture morphology around wellbore. The results indicate that induced fractures could overlap and interact with each other when the wellbore is set along the direction of minimum horizontal stress. The induced fractures have narrow width because of stress shadow effecting. However, when angle between wellbore and the minimum horizontal stress direction increases, the induced fractures prefer to link up as a simple one. Moreover, induced fractures could propagate along and perpendicular to the wellbore direction under a small horizontal stress contrast, forming a complex hydraulic fracture morphology. A high pump rate resists stress shadow effecting and improves hydraulic fracture volume, but cannot decrease the complexity of near-wellbore fractures under a small horizontal stress contrast.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Comprehensive and systematic analysis of complex pore networks is vital in elucidating the transportation of gas in coal reservoirs. In this study, multiscale heterogeneity of high volatile bituminous (hvBb) coal was reconstructed to replicate the pore connectivity. Furthermore, LPA-N2 data provides information about pore characteristics. With the digital and physical data, reliable pore-scale modelling was developed for the prediction of pore filling, sorption and diffusion of gases, including the network of pores and flow paths. The results obtained from this systematic approach is informative and gives complete details about the internal structure of coal that is viable for transportation of gas. Pore-scale modelling replicates familiar lab results. Consequently, geoscientists and reservoir engineers will be able to shorten traditional cycle times dramatically, better understand increasingly complex heterogeneous coal reservoirs, and evaluate exploratory wells, asses field development potential, and investigate early production strategies, as well improved recovery scenarios.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.Recently, electrospun nanofibers have gained attention because they are capable to capture PM2.5 and air pollutants. In this work, we developed bio-based air filters, which called cellulose@ZIFs, by dip-coating electrospun cellulose nanofibers with three synthesized zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), coding as, ZIF-8, ZIF-67 and Zn/Co-ZIF. It was found that all cellulose@ZIFs improved PM2.5 filtration perfomance. Among of these, cellulose@ZIF-8 exhibited the best PM2.5 removal efficiency (97.7 %) with the highest quality factor. In addition, a double-layer of cellulose@ZIF-8 showed an enhanced efficiency to 99.07 %. Considering the high performance, green and low-cost fabrication, the cellulose@ZIF-8 is a promising air filter for PM2.5 capture.© 2022A coupled thermo-mechanical simulation technique is proposed for reliability analyses of electronic devices based on the spectral element time domain (SETD) method. The transient spatial distribution of temperature, deformation and stress in electronic devices with different spatial scales can be obtained by using the implicit time integration method in the proposed technique. Through the thermo-mechanical equations, thin layers of electronic devices in the coupled fields can be made equivalent to surface boundaries to avoid volumetric meshing, thus reducing the number of degrees of freedom in computation and greatly improving the numerical efficiency of reliability analyses. Finally, through the thermo-mechanical analyses of different electronic devices such as a coaxial through-silicon via (TSV), and an integrated circuit (IC) package, various stress mechanisms related to the failure of electronic devices are successfully predicted to further demonstrate the capabilities of the technique to analyze the reliability of large-scale electronic devices.© 2022 IEEE.Mechanical parts are currently mass produced by machines that perform high-speed machining. The mechanical parts will be assembled in a machine with other components, and therefore there will be holes for screws, grooves etc... These parts must have a precise shape. If the machining and drilling are not done in the right place or with a small dimensional error in this case the assembly process cannot be completed. The manuel inspection is cumbersome and the efficiency is low. To overcome this problem, the non-contact defect detection process is the subject of this research. We proposed a real-time measurement technique using edge detection, dilation and erosion algorithms to remove noise and enhance the collected part image to make the information clearer, then compare it with the perfect model. This technique uses the OpenCV library and a Raspberry Pi 4 board. The experimental results show that the defect on the part can be effectively inspected, located and recognized.© ESO 2022.Context. Modelling the broadband emission of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) constitutes one of the main research topics of extragalactic astrophysics in the multi-wavelength and multi-messenger domain. Aims. We present agnpy, an open-source python package modelling the radiative processes of relativistic particles accelerated in the jets of AGN. The package includes classes describing the galaxy components responsible for line and thermal emission and it calculates the absorption due to γγ pair production on several photon fields. agnpy aims to extend the effort of modelling and interpreting the emission of extragalactic sources to a wide number of astrophysicists. Methods. We present the package content and illustrate a few examples of applications of its functionalities. We validate the software by comparing its results against the literature and against other open-source software. Results. We illustrate the utility of agnpy in addressing the most common questions encountered while modelling the emission of jetted active galaxies. When comparing its results against the literature and other modelling tools adopting the same physical assumptions, we achieve an agreement within 10-30%. Conclusions. agnpy represents one of the first systematic and validated collection of established radiative processes for jetted active galaxies in an open-source python package. We hope it will also stand among the first endeavours providing reproducible and transparent astrophysical software not only for data reduction and analysis, but also for modelling and interpretation.© 2022Variation of grating amplitudes on a surface of amorphous chalcogenide films (ACF) As20Se80 has been studied under illumination by a band-gap light with the purpose to understand mechanism of photo-induced (PI) mass transfer. After holographic recording of surface relief gratings (SRGs) of various periods Λ (from 3 to 15 µm) they were illuminated by a diode laser (λ = 660 nm) and their profile variation was analyzed using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, light scattering, and optical profilometry. The SRGs with Λ < 8 µm exponentially flattened with time of illumination, whereas amplitudes of the SRGs with Λ > 8 µm exponentially grew. Theoretical analysis of the kinetics of PI mass transfer shows that the SRG profile variation occurs by bulk diffusion of As and Se atoms as a result of competition between capillary forces and electrostatic forces created by redistribution of electrons and holes generated by light. Our theory predicts both flattening and growth of the SRG amplitudes under uniform light illumination. The PI diffusion coefficients have been estimated both from the flattening kinetics of the SRG amplitude and from its growth and found to be in good agreement with the theory. It is also observed that the profile evolution is accompanied by dewetting of ACFs and roughening of the initial SRGs.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.It is estimated that over 50% of the world's oil reserves are tied up in carbonate reservoirs. Predominantly, these reservoirs are oil wet in nature and as such, make sufficient primary and secondary recovery complex. Chemicals are considered as one of the more effective enhanced oil recovery (EOR) sources, but are often complicated by temperature and salinity parameters. Extended carboxylate surfactants have been proven to be effective molecules to positively interact with crude oil at higher reservoir extremes. In this study, adsorption of alkyl ether carboxylate extended surfactants were evaluated at elevated temperature and constant salinity using a limestone adsorbent media. Static adsorption is a commonly accepted laboratory technique used to help evaluate both technical and economic viability of surfactant based flooding applications in EOR processes. Various reports in literature suggest increases in salinity and temperature may increase adsorption tendencies. Focus was placed here on how various extensions of propylene oxide (PO) and/or ethylene oxide (EO) may influence carboxylate surfactant adsorption data. Results are intended to reveal how augmentations in hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) may either positively or negatively affect surfactant loss using static adsorption at elevated temperature. Several different alkyl ether carboxylate surfactants were studied. The academic focus for this effort was placed more on surfactant parameters being evaluated, with regard to carbonate rock mineralogy at high temperature, to study surfactant adsorption behaviour without interference of other influences. The number of mechanisms involved in surfactant loss from aqueous solutions to assorted porous media adds to the overall complexity of this phenomenon. Experimental results found in this study show that various surfactant extensions affect adsorption differently. An increase in some hydrophobic properties appear to increase surfactant adsorption. This was observed through a couple different mechanisms including increasing percent ratio of PO to EO, or increasing molecular weight of the surfactants. Conversely, increasing carbon chain length and increasing degree of alcohol branching appeared to show a general decrease in adsorption trend versus limestone mineralogy, as well as higher percent of EO. It was also observed that ratios of PO and EO extensions will also have a variable influence on surfactant adsorption. Defining experiments in the laboratory can improve overall economic efficiency of surfactant based chemical EOR processes in the field, which often struggle due to loss of chemicals by adsorption to the reservoir rock. Surfactant properties provide information on the type and mechanism of interactions involving surfactant molecules at the solid/liquid interface and their efficiency as surface-active agents. Findings from this study will be used to improve understanding on how the role of various extensions on carboxylate surfactants affect surfactant adsorption. This will help lead to enhancements in designing surfactant molecular structures that in turn, minimize adsorption to carbonate rock surfaces, while maintaining desired fluid performance for effective oil recovery.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this paper, hydrogen-air mixture combustion test was carried out with a cylindrical tank which has a diameter of 2 m and a height of 4 m. The ignitor was located at the lower part of the tank and the volume fraction of hydrogen in the mixed gas was 4.33 %, 5.17 %, 7.38 % and 10.02 % respectively. The computational fluid dynamics software Gasflow is used to simulate the experiment. The changes of pressure, gas temperature and hydrogen concentration in the tank after gas ignition were explored. The results show that when the volume fraction of hydrogen is less than 4 % cannot be ignited. When the volume fraction is above 8 %, hydrogen is consumed completely and the temperature and pressure increase significantly. In the process of combustion, the flame propagates upwards and sideways at the same time, but the upward propagation speed is obviously faster. The upward propagation speed of flame is 0.81 m/s when hydrogen concentration is 5.17 %, 7.38 % is 1.31 m/s, and 10.02 % is 2.63 m/s. The horizontal speed of flame is 0.08 m/s, 0.39 m/s and 0.62 m/s respectively.© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The date palm represents the main agricultural activity of the Drâa Tafilalet region, but unfortunately its waste often not recycled. The latter can present a good source for formulating insulation materials which are efficient and safe compared to other conventional materials. At this stage, several insulation materials have been designed from five mass fractions of date palm fiber (DPF) (40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80%) mixed with cardboard as a binder between the fibers. Then, a highly insulated house was used to evaluate the thermal properties of these composites and determine their thermophysical properties. In addition, based on an economic study, we determined the payback period, the energy savings and the optimal insulation thicknesses (OIT). The results showed that our developed insulation materials are competitive with conventional insulation materials. In addition, they offer several environmental and economic advantages.Copyright © 2022 Dong, Yang, Zhang, Yin and Wang.When a fuel rod is damaged, determining the degree of fuel failure makes sense. The operators can decide whether to continue operating the reactor or shut it down based on the severity of the fuel failure. The isotopic ratio of two radioactive fission products (FPs) is a typical technique for evaluating the degree of fuel failure, although this is not applicable in the case of little fuel failure but large tramp uranium mass. The feedforward neural network (FFNN) has been used to identify fuel failures in order to overcome the shortcomings of the isotopic ratio method, although there is still inadequacy in the ability to distinguish between an intact fuel rod and a defective fuel rod with a small defect. In this study, we propose a cascade-forward neural network with a decision tree for fuel failure detection that performs well at classifying the degree of fuel failure and, in particular, at differentiating between an intact fuel rod and a defective fuel rod with a small size defect. The input of the neural network is the specific activity of FPs measured in the coolant. The degree of fuel failure is determined by the neural network’s output, which is labeled using one-hot encoding. The training set is constructed using the Booth-type diffusion model and the first-order kinetic model. The performance of the improved neural network is demonstrated. It is shown that the improved method is more accurate and responsive than the previous neural network when recognizing the onset of fuel failure. Finally, the most important nuclides are determined through the sensitivity analysis, and the neural network is simplified according to the importance of nuclides and the limitation of the radioactive detector in practical application.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

These sources are often a cluster of distributed generation systems with alternating renewable energies. Uncertainties are important topics in research and applications. Because of the gradual exhaustion of fossil energy resources and severe concern for environmental protection, renewable energy sources (RESs) are widely deployed in power networks. The emergence of RESs poses uncertainties, leading to stringent requirements for system modeling and operation practices. This chapter summarizes the state-of-the-art approaches, techniques, and challenges within the uncertainty modeling of RESs in a practical power grid. Supporting the uniform clearing of the electricity market, a centralized dispatch model of VPP is introduced to enhance the competitiveness of distributed energy resources within the electricity market. Probabilistic methods also emerge as a serious research direction for these studies. Accurate and effective modeling of RES uncertainty involves holistic improvement. A set of distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and controllable loads are aggregated and then managed by VPP. The target of VPP is this chapter is to attenuate the entire operating expense and consider the energy loss cost.© 2022 The Author(s).The first part of this paper develops a geometric setting for differential-difference equations that resolves an open question about the extent to which continuous symmetries can depend on discrete independent variables. For general mappings, differentiation and differencing fail to commute. We prove that there is no such failure for structure-preserving mappings, and identify a class of equations that allow greater freedom than is typical. For variational symmetries, the above results lead to a simple proof of the differential-difference version of Noether's theorem. We state and prove the differential-difference version of Noether's second theorem, together with a Noether-type theorem that spans the gap between the analogues of Noether's two theorems. These results are applied to various equations from physics.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.the soot oxidation characteristics and oxidation mechanism of ethylene flame with different methane mixing ratios were studied by thermogravimetric analyzer and oxidation reaction kinetics analysis. The conclusions are as follows: in the process of programmed temperature rise, there is almost no loss in the quality of soot particles below 450 °C; With the increasing temperature, the mass of soot particles began to decrease when the temperature exceeded 500 °C; When the temperature exceeds 750 °C, the mass of soot particles is close to zero; With the increase of flame height, the thermogravimetric curve of soot first shifts to high temperature and then to low temperature; The activation energy of soot is closely related to its oxidation process, and decreases first and then increases with the deepening of soot oxidation; The mixing of methane promotes the rise of soot ignition temperature and burnout temperature, and the minimum activation energy of soot decreases at low flame height and increases at high flame height.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Breast tumour is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Researchers are working hard to develop early and improved detection tools for breast tumour. Several innovations lead to the decline in the mortality rate for this lethal illness, but breast amputation and early death diagnosis contributed the most to preventing disease transmission. Early detection of a breast tumour allows for the most effective treatment.

The aims of this study was to isolate, purify, and characterize the laccase produced by Trametes pavonia EDN 134 and to explore the laccase ability to decolorize azo textile dyes. Laccase purification process was carried out by fractionation using ammonium sulfate and continued with Hi Trap desalting column chromatography method. The results revealed that the highest laccase specific activity was 8268 U/g and detected in the ammonium sulfate fraction 40-60%. The purification using AKTA-Prime showed that the laccase specific activity enhanced to 98976.61 U/g. The purified laccase activity was optimum at pH 4 and temperature 27°C. The addition of heavy metal ions Hg2+ and Zn2+ reduced the activity of laccase, while Cu2+ and Mn2+ enhanced the activity. In addition, the purified laccase decolorized 200 ppm of Methyl Red (MR), Reactive Black 5 (RB5), and Reactive Red 120 (RR 120) of azo dyes as much as 50.7%, 21.9%, and 35.5%, respectively. This study proposes the potency of the laccase from T. pavonia EDN 134 for decolorization of textile dye wastewater.© 2022 Author(s).Cloud computing is a computing service that includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc., over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Utilizing dynamic resource allocation for load balancing is considered a vital optimization process in cloud computing. Here, we used a virtual machine serving maximum resource efficiency and scalability. Also, the creation of a desktop application for managing files in the cloud gives higher scope. The resource slicing and allocation problem use two-Time scales, including an extensive period for inter-slice resource pre-Allocation and a small-Time slot for intra-slice resource scheduling. The application consists of two major modules-admin and users. The admin can upload the files, view user details, view log history, view storage, and download details. Also, the admin can approve the files for download on request. The user can register their account, view or update their details, view the files in the cloud, request and download a file from the cloud. The application uses a cryptographic algorithm for ensuring authentication and scheduling algorithm for allocating files to the cloud in an optimal way. The priority for the files is given based on the Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm and Priority Based Optimization technique. The focus is given to the highly requested file to reduce the time of approval. For cloud storage services, the storage resources become virtualized and can form a storage pool. The cloud storage services use the internet to allow the data to be accessed and backed up on the local storage. Here, we use three cloud storage for file allocation. As a result, this application is better and efficient for write-in under low-cost circumstances.© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a demonstrated value for acute liver failure (ALF) regeneration, while their delivery stratagems with long-term biological functions, low immune response, and high biocompatibility are still a challenge. Here, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-loaded photoresponsive cryogel porous microcarrier (CPM) for MSCs delivery and colonization is presented to promote defect liver regeneration. The CPMs are fabricated with graphene oxide, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) via droplet microfluidic technology and a gradient-cooling procedure. Benefitting from the biocompatible GelMA component and the porous microstructure of the CPMs, MSCs can be nondestructively captured and abundantly delivered. Because the LPS can be released from the CPMs under NIR irradiation, the delivered MSCs are imparted with the feature of “trained immunity.” Thus, when the MSCs-laden CPMs are tailored into the liver matched patches by bioprinting and applied in ALF rats, they display superior anti-inflammatory and more significant liver regeneration properties than the untrained MSCs. These features make the CPMs an excellent MSCs delivery system for clinical applications in tissue repair.© 2022, CIGRE.

Training such diagnostic systems requires data containing fault conditions. However, fault-condition measurements are often not available due to low fault rates. This raises the question of whether ML-diagnostic systems trained with synthetic data are valid predictors for real applications. In this paper, synthetic data is generated with digital simulations of normal-and fault conditions of a high-voltage pantograph disconnector to train multiple ML-diagnostic systems. A system selection is executed using normal-condition measurements and the synthetic data only. Finally, the performance of the selected systems is evaluated with measurements of a disconnector with additional weight load. The results show that most of the ML-systems trained with synthetic data are capable to detect the fault conditions. The systems based on arti cial neural networks show the best diagnostic performance.© 2022 IEEE.COVID-19 is measured as the biggest hazardous and fast infectious grief for the human body which has a severe impact on lives, health, and the community all over the world. It is still spreading throughout the world with different variants which is silently killing many lives globally. Thus, earlier diagnosis and accurate detection of COVID-19 cases are essential to protect global lives. Diagnosis COVID-19 through chest X-ray images is one of the best solutions to detect the virus in the infected person properly and quickly at a low cost. Encouraged by the existing research, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid model to classify the Covid cases and non-Covid cases with chest X-ray images based on feature extraction, machine learning and deep learning techniques. Two feature extractors, Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) and CNN (MobileNetV2, Sequential, ResNet152V2) are used to train the model. For the classification, we utilized two approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for machine learning and CNN (MobileNetV2, Sequential, ResNet152V2) classifiers for deep learning. The experimental result analysis shows that the Sequential model and the ResNet152V2 model achieve 100% and 82.6% accuracy respectively which is satisfactory. On the other hand, the HOG-SVM method successfully detects all the test images correctly which provides the best result with 100% accuracy, specificity, and responsiveness over a limited public dataset.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryA new route for the synthesis of dinuclear bisborylene complexes was described.

This method can be applied in ambient pressure that makes this method more feasible. The discharge of plasma from the plasma jet can be adjusted according to the design used. Carrier gas that is used in the plasma jet system can also be adapted to the needs or appropriate to the target material. The gases that can be used are helium, argon, etc. A variant gas flow rate will also affect the plasma species and the surface material characteristics produced. Modifying a material with certain compounds can be done by passing the active gases or vapors through the carrier gas. The use of the plasma jet method possibly converts the surface material to be hydrophobic or hydrophilic characteristics. Moreover, the plasma jet technique is applicable for various materials or substrates in any dimension. This review article will discuss the parameters applied, such as various designs, carrier gas, gas flow rates, power used in the plasma jet.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Single star systems like our solar system are in fact not the most abundant in our universe. This research paper will specifically investigate the wide, or visual, binary star systems within the Hyades open star cluster and their positions on color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). To do this, this work incorporates the Gaia EDR3 dataset and python coding to conduct the mass selection and graphing of the data. The stars within the Hyades are first selected by evaluating their coordinates and then their relative motion. This maximizes our accuracy in selecting gravitationally bound stars within the Hyades. Then, by further reducing the margins, this paper identifies comoving wide binary star systems within our initially selected Hyades candidates. Finally, the CMD of the wide binary star systems within the Hyades star cluster is plotted along with the other none-binary star systems within the star cluster and the stars within the local 100 parsec (pc) of the Earth.© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe intermittent and stochastic power injections of the penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generators make the processing of fault restoration in the distribution network need to consider more uncertainties. A new scheme of robust fault restoration methods, aiming to maximize the recovery of outage power, is proposed for unbalanced distribution networks utilizing affine numbers to describe the uncertainty of PV outputs. Besides, the safe operation of the network is taken into account as its constraint condition. This restoration method is presented in two subsequent steps. The first step is the restoration of the island power outage, with the objective to reasonably isolate the power outage area containing the black-start PV to achieve island power supply recovery. Then the second step is to maximize the use of the remaining capacity of the main network and restore the power outage to ensure the power supply of the entire network. To solve the mathematical restoration model accurately, the piecewise linear approximation method based on the best isometric idea is introduced to relax the original objective function into a linear solvable form. An efficient decomposition algorithm, named column-and-constraints generation (C&CG), is used to solve the model, which can further improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical tests on different test systems demonstrate that the proposed robust restoration methodology yields obvious advantages in resisting system uncertainties by contrast with the existing deterministic restoration methods.© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Development of gallium oxide-based devices is one of the most promising areas of modern electronic technology. The method of ion implantation is widely used in electronic engineering; however, it has not yet been sufficiently studied for gallium oxide from a physical point of view. One of the interesting questions is the possible impact of surface orientation of β-Ga2O3 single crystals on the structural damage upon ion irradiation. In this work, the effect of Si+ ion irradiation on the structural properties of β-Ga2O3 crystals with (−2 0 1) and (0 1 0) surface orientations has been investigated by X-ray diffraction and small-angle reflection electronography. It is established that mechanical stresses in the irradiated layer depend on surface orientation: in the case of (−2 0 1) orientation, the stress in lateral to the surface direction is compressive, while it is tensile for the (0 1 0) orientation. At one and the same irradiation dose, the degree of damage for (0 1 0) orientation is shown to be stronger than that for (−2 0 1). Possible explanation is suggested for the surface orientation effect.© 2022, Editorial Office of China Civil Engineering Journal.

Firstly, the vibration laboratory test of the steel-slab-ribbed bridge-deck is performed. Secondly, a test-verified three-dimensional dynamic model is established based on the modal superposition finite element method, so that the plate vibration energy can be calculated. Furthermore, based on the finite element mode analysis method, the guided-wave types and dispersion characteristics are studied with a guided-wave model. Finally, the influences of plate thickness, rib thickness and rib space on vibration energy and characteristics of bending guided-wave are studied. The research results discloses that under unilateral suspension constraints, the dominant frequency bands of plate and rib vibration responses appear at 300 Hz and 400 Hz, and the vibration energy at the measuring points of rib edge is greater. Under the boundary consolidation constraint, the thinner plate has higher vibration energy peak value and lower peak frequency. From the perspective of guided wave transmission, the pass-band and attenuation band may appear with interval on the frequency dispersion curves of bending waves, the guided-wave mode number decreases with the increase of plate and rib thickness. Plate thickness has the greatest influence on the out-of-plane vibration attenuation zone, and the maximum difference in bandwidth is 110 Hz. Therefore, the out-of-plane wave vibration attenuation zone can be effectively controlled through plate thickness.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.The Internet of Things (IoT) has become the essential part of human life with commencement smart technologies.

However, lignin’s functionality can be directly utilised when it stays as native with cellulose and hemicellulose in plant biomass, rather than being separated. The fabrication process of this native lignin is sustainable, as it consumes less energy and chemicals compared to purified lignin; thus, it is an economic and more straightforward approach. In this study, the properties of native and purified lignin–cellulose nanocrystals (L–CNCs) sourced from hemp hurd waste were compared to explore the differences in their morphology, UV-shielding properties and chemical structure affected by their distinct fabrication process. These two kinds of L–CNCs were further added into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to evaluate their reinforcement characteristics. The resulting native L–CNCs/PVA film showed stronger UV-shielding ability than purified L–CNCs. Moreover, the native L–CNCs showed better compati-bility with PVA, while the purified L–CNCs/PVA interfaces showed phase separation. The phase separation in purified L–CNCs/PVA films reduced the films’ tensile strength and Young’s modulus and increased the water vapour transmission. The laboratory-scale cost of native L–CNCs production (~AUD 80/kg) was only 10% of purified L–CNCs (~AUD 850/kg), resulting in a comparatively lower cost for preparing native L–CNCs/PVA composite films. Overall, this study shows that the proposed method of production and use of native L–CNCs can be an economic approach to deliver UV-shielding properties for potential applications, such as food packaging.© 2022 Accounts of Materials Research.

This issue can be addressed by framing the particle with a more stable metal M for the generation of a Ag@M core-frame nanocrystal. In addition to the improvement in shape stability, the inclusion of metal M expands the functionality and capability of the Ag nanocrystals. The first part of this Account introduces two strategies for the rational synthesis of Ag-based core-frame nanocubes. In the first strategy, a precursor to metal M is cotitrated with Ag+ ions into an aqueous suspension of Ag nanocubes in the presence of ascorbic acid (H2Asc, reducing agent) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, colloidal stabilizer) under ambient conditions. The M and Ag atoms derived from the two precursors are preferentially codeposited along the edges of Ag nanocubes for the creation of Ag@M-Ag core-frame nanocubes. The second strategy combines the carving of Ag from the side faces of Ag nanocubes and the concurrent deposition of M and Ag atoms on the edges in an orthogonal fashion. In one protocol, the precursor to M is titrated into an aqueous suspension of Ag nanocubes in the presence of H2Asc, sodium hydroxide (pH modifier), and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (colloidal stabilizer and surface capping agent) under ambient conditions. In another protocol, the precursor is titrated into a mixture of Ag nanocubes, PVP (colloidal stabilizer and surface capping agent), and ethylene glycol (solvent and reducing agent) at an elevated temperature. In both cases, Ag atoms are carved from the side faces via oxidative etching while M and Ag atoms derived from the chemical reduction are codeposited on the edges for the generation of Ag@M-Ag core-frame concave nanocubes. The second part of this Account showcases the augmented properties of the Ag-based core-frame nanocrystals, in addition to some new functionality. The first example demonstrates how to preserve the shape of Ag nanocubes at an elevated temperature by passivating the vulnerable edges with Ir frames. The second example highlights the use of Ag-Pd core-frame nanocubes as a SERS probe for in situ monitoring the Pd-catalyzed reduction of 4-nitrothiophenol to 4-aminothiophenol by NaBH4 and the subsequent Ag-catalyzed oxidation of 4-ATP to trans-4,4′-dimercaptoazobezene by the oxygen from air. The third example establishes a method for the transformation of Ag@Au-Au core-frame concave nanocubes into trimetallic cage cubes through a site-selective galvanic replacement reaction. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that the shape stability of Ag nanocrystals can be enhanced while introducing new functionality by framing their edges with a different metal.© 2022 IEEE.Accurate and effective identification of the operating characteristics and application modes of electrochemical energy storage systems (EESS) is of great significance for the safe and reliable operation of large-scale EESS in power generation, transmission and distribution. The paper proposes a method for identifying the operating conditions of EESS based on the random forest algorithm. Analyzing and characterizing the typical operating conditions, such as frequency regulation, PV-EESS combination, Wind-EESS output schedule and smoothing, and peak shaving, the method introduces the random forest algorithm to build the identification model of EESS operating conditions. The variable importance measures, training model and test analysis have been completed. The results show that the method has an identification accuracy of more than 95% for the five typical operating conditions, which can effectively identify the EESS operating conditions.© 2022, V. Lashkaryov Institute of Semiconductor Physics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.The out-of-plane optical properties of a combined one-two-dimensional comb-type photonic structure based on macroporous silicon under illumination with polarized normally incident light have been experimentally investigated. Technologically simple quasi-periodic structure with parallel air grooves in the form of mutually overlapping macropores (i.e., one-dimensional air/Si type structure) together with macropores arbitrarily distributed over the crystal surface (two-dimensional air/Si structure) was studied in comparison with the calculated one-dimensional periodic metal lattice on silicon. It is shown that this combined air/Si photonic structure has significant polarization selectivity and can serve as a basis for developing the full-function out-of-plane thermal photodetector on macroporous silicon.© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Due to the relatively high hydrogen content, ammonia also shows application potential as a hydrogen storage material. However, the domain industrial method for ammonia synthesis is the Haber-Bosch process while the synthesis process has to be carried out at high temperature and high pressure, which requires a lot of energy. At the same time, hydrogen, which is one of the reactants, needs to be obtained by steam reforming of natural gas and the CO2 by-product is the main greenhouse gas. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional Haber-Bosch process, scientists have focused on the electrochemical catalytic synthesis of ammonia in recent years. Ammonia can be facilely synthesized from N2 and H2O in a mild environment and the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is therefore recognized as a clean and reproducible method for ammonia synthesis. However, since N2 is relatively very stable in ambient condition, the ammonia generation rate and Faraday efficiency of electrochemically catalyzed NRR are relatively low. There is still a long way to reach the standard of industrial synthetic ammonia. Therefore, catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity toward NRR are widely studied. Among the new developed catalysts, the precious metal catalyst exhibits relatively high ammonia synthesis rate and Faraday efficiency. At the same time, it has relatively great stability compared with cost-effective catalysts. This chapter mainly reviews the research progress of noble metal catalysts and the performance and mechanism of each catalyst in the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia. Finally, some perspectives are made on the shortcomings of noble metal catalysts and future research and development.© 2022 Author(s).A low-cost real-time photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has been developed by replacing the sophisticated laser and transducer with a very low-energy diode laser and a condenser microphone.

Although there are some limitations needed to be dealt with, the sample images obtained are adequate. Thus, our PAM with real-time scanning capability using low-cost equipment is feasible.© 2022 Author(s).One aspect that affects the space spectrum is the space vacuum environment. Because to achieve the satellite mission, the thermal control system (TCS) analysis is needed. TCS is one of the sub-systems in the development of the design of a satellite whose task is to control the state of the satellite so that the satellite mission can be achieved as desired. Space environments have temperatures up to 125°C give affect satellite performance. Therefore, TCS management is needed in a robust, modular, and scalable manner so that the mission carried out by a satellite can be successful. TCS satellite management can be grouped into two groups, passive and active. Passive TCS is used in this paper with absorptivity and emissivity value for the optical properties material. Two scenarios carried out in the TCS satellite are the worst hot and cold cases. The internal power dissipation was used for the comparison temperature satellite with three conditions of solar radiation, at the vernal equinox, winter solstice, and summer solstice. Using these two cases, various design parameters were evaluated; two worst-case design approaches were calculated.© 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Overall, 485 patients who received radiotherapy for bone metastases were grouped as per the NRF model (groups I, II and III) and Katagiri score (low-, intermediate- and high-risk). Survival was compared using the log-rank or log-rank trend test. Independent prognostic factors were identified using multivariate Cox regression analyses (MCRA). MCRA and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare both models' accuracy. For the 376 evaluable patients, the overall survival (OS) rates decreased significantly in the higher-tier groups of both models (P < 0.001). All evaluated factors except 'previous chemotherapy status' differed significantly between groups. Both models exhibited independent predictive power (P < 0.001). Per NRF model, hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.44 (P = 0.099) and 2.944 (P < 0.001), respectively, for groups II and III, relative to group I. Per Katagiri score, HRs for intermediate- and high-risk groups were 4.02 (P < 0.001) and 7.09 (P < 0.001), respectively, relative to the low-risk group. Areas under the curve (AUC) for predicting 6-, 18- and 24-month mortality were significantly higher when using the Katagiri score (P = 0.036, 0.039 and 0.022). Both models predict survival. Prognostic accuracy of the Katagiri score is superior, especially in patients with long-term survival potential; however, in patients with short prognosis, no difference occurred between both models; simplicity and patient burden should also be considered.© 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.Advanced high strength steel (AHSS) with Zn coating shows an abnormal liquid metal embrittlement (LME) during the assembly welding, limiting its application in the automotive industry. The element content of AHSS is believed to be one of the most important factors to control the Zn-assisted LME susceptibility. In this paper, the role of Si content in the liquid metal embrittlement for resistance spot welded joint of the galvanized QP980 AHSS was investigated. It was found that increasing the Si content could have a significant effect on the microstructural evolution of the galvanized QP980 AHSS, e.g., increased decarburization layer depth and internal oxide density. Moreover, the specimen with 1.8 wt.% Si content revealed more and longer LME cracks compared with those for the specimen with only 0.8 wt.% Si, reflecting the tendency of lower Si content being favorable to decrease the LME susceptibility of galvanized QP980 AHSS. In particular, the elements Si, Mn and O exhibited a synchronous segregation, implying some internal relation among them and their mutual effects on the liquid Zn during the resistance spot welding (RSW) process, which are deemed the crucial mechanism of LME formation.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.Directed energy deposition (DED) is an additive manufacturing process that produces remanufacturers and repairs metal parts and its unique characteristics enable the combination of materials with different properties and surface functionalization. However, DED alone does not always produce surfaces and dimensional quality suitable for most intended applications, thus requiring post-processing steps. Research on post-processing materials obtained by metal additive manufacturing has focused on non-conventional processes, primarily over flat surfaces. Little emphasis has been placed on surface characteristics, mainly when traditional operations are conducted on more intricate geometries. DED and machining can be combined in the same equipment, in what is called hybrid manufacturing (HM). This research work performs an example of remanufacturing using an HM process. An injection mold part, originally in AISI 1045, was remanufactured with AISI 316L stainless steel with the use of laser-based directed energy deposition (DED-LB) and high-speed machining (HSM) towards improving surface finishing and dimensional accuracy. The parameters and strategy employed by DED-LB obtained a material with no significant porosity, cracks, or microstructure defects. The stainless steel improved the corrosion resistance of the component; the resulting microstructure was similar to those obtained in similar works and hardness was slightly higher, enhancing the wear resistance. An analysis of surface roughness using Sa revealed different roughness values for the side and top areas with a strong dependency on both trajectory and semi-melted particles. The HSM process reduced the Sa value by approximately 90% with relatively short times in comparison to other surface finishing processes. The remanufacturing of components by DED-LB deposition of stainless steel onto carbon steels has opened a wide range of new applications, especially for complex 3D surfaces belonging to high-value components.© 2022, Editorial Office of Chinese I.C.E.

The SrMg2Bi2 Zintl compound has been theoretically illustrated to have a small ΔE, suggesting an approximately inherent convergence of two band orbitals. Therefore, this work is devoted to the revelation of the thermoelectric potential of the SrMg2Bi2 Zintl compound in a broad Hall carrier concentration of 0.3-5 × 1019 cm-3 by Ag-doping at the Sr site. The electrical transport properties can be well predicted by the single parabolic band model with acoustic phonon scattering, which reveals a multi-band transporting behavior in the heavily doped samples due to Fermi level deepening, leading to a significant zT-enhancement. In terms of the model, a peak zT of up to 1.0 is achievable by assuming the amorphous minimum lattice thermal conductivity, which demonstrates this compound as a promising thermoelectric material.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Along with the speedy improvement of sensing systems, wireless transmission technology, and faster and faster chip, the scope of application of the Internet of things (IoT) has substantially and rapidly increased, and research and innovation that integrate artificial intelligence.

Herein, a free-standing Fe2O3/C shells/reduced graphene oxide (Fe2O3/C/RGO) film as an additive-free anode is fabricated by a facile two-step strategy accompanied by the physical cross-linking feature of chitosan. In this free-standing structure, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of 20-30 nm are encapsulated by chitosan pyrolytic C shells and further confined within a highly ordered RGO film. As a consequence, the ultrasmall Fe2O3 NPs can effectively reduce the Li+ diffusion pathway, while the C shell and RGO sheets act as a matrix to alleviate the huge volumetric change of Fe2O3 NPs during the charge/discharge process. Benefiting from the advantages of a free-standing film, the well-designed Fe2O3/C/RGO film effectively resolves long-standing challenges and achieves an admirable capacity of 609 mAh·g-1 at 1 A·g-1, a good rate performance (up to 4 A·g-1), and an outstanding cycling performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a universal strategy to integrate TMOs with RGO to construct a flexible self-supported film for superior lithium-ion batteries.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Petroleum Development Oman operates large amount of gas wells in Sultanate of Oman.

Temperature sensitivity is a critical issue in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for EVs. The control of the working temperature lithium-ion battery is critical to its performance and long-term durability. Battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are based on different cooling methods using air, liquid, phase change materials, heat pipe, etc. A review of different sorts of cooling strategies utilized in battery pack thermal management with a focus of those based on nanofluid is presented in the current paper. Additionally, the utilization of nanofluids combined with phase change materials (PCMs) and heat pipes (HPs) for BTMSs is also introduced. Nanofluids are effectively utilized to improve the thermal management of the batteries. Hybrid cooling system based on nanofluids for BTMSs decreases the temperature rise and consequently improves the temperature uniformity in comparison with the single BTMS. Finally, this current review describes that more works concerned with BTMS are still indispensable to enhance the technology and advancements of EVs.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIn the recent decades, in order to obtain more excellent performance and a wider range of applications of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), researchers have explored potential electrode materials.

In reality, the poor stability is mainly due to the high-density defects in the perovskite films, which provide a channel for charge nonradiative recombination and ion migration. In this work, a multifunctional aminoguanidine hemisulfate (AG HSUL) is introduced into the CsPbIBr2 perovskite layer to achieve defect passivation. Guanidine cations (GA+) can form strong hydrogen bonds with under-coordinated halogen ions to stabilize the crystal lattice; the nitrogen atom in the amino group can form a complex with the under-coordinated lead ion; inorganic acids and ions can not only compensate for halogen anion vacancies, but also combine with lead clusters or capped lead ions to reduce defect density. The synergistic effect of anions and cations can effectively passivate the defects, and an energy conversion efficiency of 10.10% is obtained at the optimal concentration of modification. In addition, carbon electrodes are used instead of metal electrodes, which greatly reduces the cost. The results provide a new idea for the development of efficient all-inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The tension precision of pre-tightened wire rope with both ends fixed (PWRBEF) was very important for closed loop configuration (CCL) module of the satellite solar array.

With the technique, a portable tension calibration system was established to carry on the calibration experiments, which can decouple the measurement error caused by all factors. The single or multiple factors relationship were analysed to eliminate the measurement error of PWRBEF. Depending on the experiments results, the calibration database was built to test and adjust the tension of the PWRBEF in the CCL module.

The deployment synchronization and deployment reliability of the solar array were effectively ensured.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Based on the research achievements of the Haiyuan 1 oscillating buoy wave power generation device, this paper proposes the innovation about a group array of the buoy to increase the output of power generation and realize large-scale power generation. Firstly, the conversion efficiency of wave energy captured by buoys of arrays 3, 6, and 9 for power generation is theoretically estimated. According to wave theory, the energy conversion efficiency of buoy increases with the increase of array number. Then, the modeling and simulation of the buoy array wave energy generation system are carried out by using AMESim simulation software. Through the simulation and optimization of the parameters of the components in the array buoy storage power generation system, the stability and efficiency of the wave power generation device under different array buoys are studied. The simulation results show that by adjusting the volume of the accumulator, precharge pressure and the displacement of the hydraulic motor, the power generation system can not only realize the continuous power output, but also the power output increases with the increase of the number of accumulators. It is proved that the feasibility and rationality of the designed buoy power generation system in group array module, and the research results can make a reliable technical reference for the construction and implementation of large-scale wave power generation system.© 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

From May 2016 to August 2018, the Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology conducted a questionnaire based on the Japanese national structure survey of radiation oncology in 2015. Data were analyzed based on the institutional stratification by the annual number of new patients treated with radiotherapy per institution. The estimated annual numbers of new and total (new plus repeat) patients treated with radiation were 225 000 and 271 000, respectively. Additionally, the estimated cancer incidence was 891 445 cases with approximately 25.2% of all newly diagnosed patients being treated with radiation. The types and numbers of treatment devices actually used included linear accelerator (linac; n = 936), Gamma Knife (n = 43), 60Co remote afterloading system (RALS; n = 21), and 192Ir RALS (n = 129). The linac system used dual-energy functions in 754 units, 3D conformal radiotherapy functions in 867, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) functions in 628. There were 899 Japan Radiological Society/Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology-certified radiation oncologists (RO), 1213.9 full-time equivalent (FTE) ROs, 2394.2 FTE radiotherapy technologists (RTT), 295.7 FTE medical physicists, 210.2 FTE radiotherapy quality managers, and 906.1 FTE nurses. The frequency of IMRT use significantly increased during this time. In conclusion, the Japanese structure of radiation oncology has clearly improved in terms of equipment and utility although there was a shortage of personnel in 2015.© 2022 The Author(s).Motivated by the abundance of fractals in the natural world, this paper further develops continuum-type models for product-like fractals. The theory is based on a version of the non-integer dimensional space approach, in which global balance laws written for fractal media are expressed in terms of conventional (integer-order) integrals. Key relations of calculus for finite strain kinematics of fractal media are obtained, especially clarifying the fractal Jacobian and the fractal Reynolds transport theorem. The local forms are then written in terms of partial differential equations with derivatives of integer order. Hence, fractal versions of local continuity, linear and angular momenta and energy balance are derived. The angular momentum balance implies that the approximating continuum is micropolar rather than classical. Accordingly, the Cauchy postulate, lemma and theorem for Cauchy force-stress and couple-stress are re-formulated. The corresponding partial differential equations for finite as well as infinitesimal elasticity are given explicitly in both the displacement and stress formulations. The invariance of the stress field in planar fractal elastic media is shown to hold just like the one in planar micropolar elasticity.© 2022 by the authors.

Traffic incidents are one of the six causes of non-recurrent congestion. Early and accurate detection helps reduce incident duration, but it remains a challenge due to the limitation of current sensor technologies. In this paper, we employ a recurrence-based technique, the Quadrant Scan, to analyse time series traffic volume data for incident detection. The data is recorded by multiple sensors along a section of urban highway. The results show that the proposed method can detect incidents better by integrating data from the multiple sensors in each direction, compared to using them individually. It can also distinguish non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by incidents from recurrent congestion. The results show that the Quadrant Scan is a promising algorithm for real-time traffic incident detection with a short delay. It could also be extended to other non-recurrent congestion types.© 2022 Author(s).In order to investigate the microscopic evolution of the step flow growth process and reveal the microscopic origins of crystalline anisotropy during the epitaxial growth of 3C-SiC (0001) vicinal surface, a three-dimensional Kinetic Monte Carlo model is established, in which Si and C are considered individually. The helicoidal boundary condition is applied to the direction perpendicular to the step, and the periodic boundary condition is used in the direction along the step. Then, the effects of crystalline anisotropy on lateral growth rate, morphologies of step patterns, and growth mode are studied. The results show that the lateral growth rate in [1-210] is larger than that in 1 - 100 and the zigzag and meandering patterns of step are constructed in [1-210] and 1 - 100 directions, respectively, which is consistent with the experimental observations. Two possible origins of anisotropy are also revealed: one is the higher concentration of the edge sites of the step and the larger bonding energy in the [1-210] direction and another is the adatom diffusion along the edge of the step. Finally, a larger area of pure step flow growth mode is obtained in the [1-210] direction, which is good for lowering the cost for 3C-SiC epitaxial layers.© 2022 by the authors.

Although the Sage–Husa adaptive Kalman filter (SHAKF) has been applied to the target tracking field, the precision and stability of SHAKF remain to be improved. In this paper, a square root Sage–Husa adaptive robust Kalman filter (SR-SHARKF) algorithm together with the constant jerk model is proposed, which can not only solve the problem of filtering divergence triggered by numerical rounding errors, inaccurate system mathematics, and noise statistical models, but also improve the filtering accuracy. First, a novel square root decomposition method is proposed in the SR-SHARKF algorithm for decomposing the covariance matrix of SHAKF to assure its non-negative definiteness. After that, a three-segment approach is adopted to balance the observed and predicted states by evaluating the adaptive scale factor. Finally, the unbiased and the biased noise estimators are integrated while the interval scope of the measurement noise is constrained to jointly evaluate the measurement and observation noise for better adaptability and reliability. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in eliminating white noise triggered by the USV and target oscillations.© 2022 Author(s).The COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2/SARS-CoV-2. In 2020, Indonesia is the second country with the highest COVID-19 pandemic cases in Southeast Asia. Prevention of the spread of COVID-19 is carried out by quarantining infected individuals. The spread of this infectious disease can be represented in a susceptible infected quarantine recovered (SIQR) model. We formulate a SIQR model, apply the model to COVID-19 in Indonesia, determine the pattern of its transmission, and interpret the results of the application of the model. In this paper, the data used from March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed to obtain the parameter values. Based on the application, the pattern of the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia during 2020-2025 shows that the number of susceptible, infected, quarantine, and recovered individuals are downward trends. Furthermore, there are still infected individuals in 2025, and this amount can be reduced if the quarantine and self-isolation process is carried out optimally.© 2022 by the authors.

In particular, multi-port solid-state transformer (SST) topologies have been addressed and classified according to their isolation capabilities and their conversion stages configurations. Non-conventional configurations have been considered. A comparison of the most relevant features and design specifications between popular topologies has been provided through a comprehensive and effective table. Potential benefits of SSTs in distribution applications have been highlighted even with reference to a network active nodes usage. This review also highlights standards and technical regulations in force for connecting SSTs to the electrical distribution system. Finally, two case studies of multi-port topologies have been presented and discussed. The first one is an isolated multi-port bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter useful in fast-charging applications. The second case of study deals with a three-port AC-AC multi-level power converter in H-Bridge configuration able to replicate a network active node and capable of routing and controlling energy under different operating conditions.© 2022 Author(s).LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) is the most popular cathode material used for lithium-ion batteries. NCA batteries have some features of high capacity and high density but have a certain life-cycle so in the end, it becomes spent NCA batteries. Spent NCA batteries contain dangerous heavy metals for the environment, but it also valuable. In this study, valuable metals from spent NCA battery that is nickel and cobalt were recovered using mixed phosphoric acid and citric acid as a leaching agent and also as a reductant agent. The effects of various temperatures and concentrations of mixed acid were investigated to reach the optimum condition on the process of leaching nickel and cobalt. Spent NCA cathode was being dissolved by aqua-regia to determine the content of metals that could be leached. In the leaching process, the metals were leached in acid solution, and the concentration of metals ion in leachate was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). The leaching efficiencies of both nickel and cobalt reached about 99.6% of nickel and 93.4% of cobalt at the optimum leaching condition of 0.5 M phosphoric acid and 1.5 M citric acid with ratio solid to liquid (S/L) 30 g/L at 90°C for 60 minutes.© 2022 Optica Publishing Group.3D object detection is an important module for autonomous driving. A LiDAR camera optical system is suitable for accurate object detection, for it provides both 3D structure and 2D texture features. However, as LiDAR and a camera have different sensor properties, it is challenging to generate effective fusion features. Motivated by this, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, a novel LiDAR-camera based 3D object detection method. First, proposal selection is presented to utilize accurate 2D proposals predicted from RGB images to improve the quality of 3D proposals. It contains a (i) proposal addition and (ii) proposal filter. To increase the recall rate, the proposal addition generates extra 3D proposals via back-projecting 2D proposals on LiDAR depth. The proposal filter removes unrelated3D proposals by matching 2Dproposals with intersection-over-union thresholds. Then, considering the LiDAR mechanism, grid attention pooling is employed to estimate weights of grid points from LiDAR and image features to generate salient pooling features. Comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance and benefits the advanced application of a LiDAR camera system.© 2001-2012 IEEE.Force sensing is fundamental for developing smart surgical devices capable of in-vivo tissue stiffness measurement. The sensing technique necessitates integration of micromachined force sensors at the end-effectors of tactile probes. We discuss fabrication and characterization of a small footprint silicon diaphragm-based force sensor with boron-doped piezoresistors connected in Wheatstone bridge configuration. The sensor performance characteristics for axial indentation experiments yield sensitivity 0.34 mV/mN, linearity > 0.99, and hysteresis 1.18% for force range 0-250 mN. To validate the utility of the force sensor for mechanical characterization of soft tissues, we perform indentation experiments on sheep tracheal tissues. The study involved two important mechanical characterization techniques: compression and stress relaxation. Tissue samples comprised of cartilage tissue from the cranial, middle, and caudal portions of the trachea and smooth muscle tissue. We record the hysteresis patterns of the tissue samples at $10 ~\mu \text{m}$ /s strain rate. The stiffness of cranial, middle, and caudal cartilage at 20% strain are 23±1.39 N/m,22.36±2.05 N/m, and 22.41±2.04 N/m. The cranial cartilage is innately stiffer than other tracheal segments; however, the results show no statistical variation (p ≥ 0.1488) in cartilage stiffness based on anatomical region. The stiffness of smooth muscle at 30% strain measures to be 14.02±0.76 N/m. The stress relaxation experiments reveal cartilage samples have faster relaxation time, and the smooth muscle tissues respond less rapidly to compression loads and have slower relaxation time. The feasibility of characterizing soft tissues at low contact force and small sensing area extends the utility of the sensor in airway diagnostic tools for localized stiffness measurement.© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.For decades, crude oil spills and oil wastewater have become the most problematic environmental pollution and damage to public health. Therefore, it is considerable to develop superhydrophobic polymer foam for separating oil from water with high selectivity and sorption capacity. Here, a new type of environmentally friendly pure polypropylene (PP) foam with superhydrophobicity is first time proposed with a particular coexistence of microspheres and microporous structure fabricated via an advanced solvent-evaporation method. The PP foam exhibits exceptional superhydrophobic with a water contact angle of 151° and the maximum saturated adsorption capacity of 26 g g−1. After more than 15 h of cyclic continuous oil–water pumping experiment, it still maintains a high oil absorption efficiency of 98%, providing the basis for practical commercial applications. More importantly, the variation of hydrophobic properties is described by Flory–Huggins polymer solution theory and Huggins interaction parameters, and the optimal solution ratio range is predicted which provides a relevant theoretical basis for actual industrial production.© 2022 by the authors.

In addition, they are some of the few old celestial objects for which distances can be reliably inferred. As such, these stars are excellent tracers of the oldest structures that exist in the inner Galaxy. Although the inner Galaxy is where the oldest structures in the Milky Way are thought to be hidden, it is also a region notoriously difficult to study due to high extinction and crowding. Here, I will summarize how RR Lyrae stars have been used to obtain a more complete picture of the inner Galaxy. In particular, recently, a large sample of RR Lyrae star motions through space have been obtained and compared to younger, more metal-rich stars in the bulge/bar. It is seen that the inner Galaxy RR Lyrae star kinematics are complicated by a mix of a variety of Galactic components. After isolating only those RR Lyrae stars that are confined to the bulge, a subsample of these stars have slower rotation and are less barred than the dominant bar/bulge. Curiously, there is no discernible metallicity [Fe/H] difference between these two subsamples. Old, metal-poor stars in the inner Galaxy need to be properly accounted for when discussing processes that gave rise to the formation of the inner Galaxy and the Galactic bar/bulge.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In order to study the effect of inlet paired swirl distortion on the performance and stability of compressor, a full-annulus unsteady numerical simulation of the effects of swirl distortion on performance and stability of transonic rotor Rotor 37 is carried out in this paper. The result shows that: the rotor performance deteriorates and the stable working range decreases under the effect of vortex flow distortion; the circumferential side flow caused by vortex swirl distortion leads to the uneven circumferential distribution of flow parameters at the inlet and the outlet of the compressor; the rotor blade has a very significant attenuation effect on the swirl distortion, and the swirl distortion intensity decreases along the axial direction; the circumferentially inhomogeneous distribution of rotor angle causes excessive local aerodynamic load on the rotor, and high intensity leakage vortices and excitation vortices are generated at the blade tip. The circumferentially unevenly distributed swirl angle causes excessive local aerodynamic load of the rotor, resulting in high-intensity leakage vortex and shock wave interference in the blade tip area, which severely blocks the flow path and eventually leads to unstable flow in the Rotor37.© 2022, Indian Academy of Sciences.Construction of neutron energy spectrum is of interest in various scientific fields such as nuclear power, nuclear security, industrial applications of nuclear and fundamental physics. A genetic neutron spectrum unfolding method is proposed to generate neutron energy spectrum giving light output data from a liquid organic scintillation detector. The method presented attempts to unfold given minimum a priori data, specifically it does not require an initial guess spectrum to be supplied. Two response matrices corresponding to an EJ-309 organic liquid scintillator are constructed for testing, with one matrix using the traditional discretisation and the other using an alternate discretisation based on the energy-to-light conversion process. Test cases include MCNPX-PoliMi simulated 252Cf, AmLi and AmBe spectra with corresponding detector responses. The genetic method can perform a coarse unfolding of the test spectra, potentially enough to perform an initial categorisation of the spectra. Promising results are obtained when genetic method is used in conjunction with the existing MAXED unfolding code, which operates on the maximum entropy principle. In this scenario, accuracy appears to exceed MAXED using its built-in default a priori spectrum. The 252Cf test case saw a reduction in the unfolded spectrum error from 5.08× 10 - 3 to 9.42× 10 - 5. The AmLi and AmBe test cases could not be unfolded by MAXED using its default spectrum; however, when supplied with the genetic method result, MAXED could complete a successful unfold.© 2022, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd.

The general performance analysis of inhomogeneous thermoelectric generator is presented. The impacts of number of thermoelectric elements, heat conductance and temperature of high temperature source on performance characteristics of inhomogeneous thermoelectric generator are discussed. The results show that, compared with homogeneous thermoelectric generator, the maximum output power and maximum efficiency of the thermoelectric generator can be effectively improved due to the increase in the inhomogeneous degree of thermal conductivity. And the performance characteristics could be enhanced with higher number of thermoelectric elements, heat conductance or temperature of high temperature source.This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryLight induced electron transfer reactions of molecules on the surface of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) depend significantly on the electronic properties of the metal-organic interface. Hybridized metal-molecule states and dipoles at the interface alter the work function and facilitate or hinder electron transfer between the NPs and ligand. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of isolated AuNPs coated with thiolated ligands in a vacuum have been performed as a function of photon energy, and the depth dependent information of the metal-organic interface has been obtained. The role of surface dipoles in the XPS measurements of isolated ligand coated NPs is discussed and the binding energy of the Au 4f states is shifted by around 0.8 eV in the outer atomic layers of 4-nitrothiophenol coated AuNPs, facilitating electron transport towards the molecules. Moreover, the influence of the interface dipole depends significantly on the adsorbed ligand molecules. The present study paves the way towards the engineering of the electronic properties of the nanoparticle surface, which is of utmost importance for the application of plasmonic nanoparticles in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis and solar energy conversion.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.In this paper, the mechanical properties of a single-ply woven composites are investigated through a combination of multiscale numerical simulation and experimental test. The tensile experiments of three woven structures with different thread counts, 4.5+4.0, 5.5+7.0 and 5.5+5.0, are conducted. A multiscale numerical method is proposed in order to understand the influence mechanism of thread count on the mechanical properties. The numerical predictions have a good agreement with the experimental results. Many unique characteristics of the single-ply woven composites have been observed, such as the clearly nonlinear mechanical behavior of samples with large thread count, the positive transversal normal strain during the initial phase of longitudinal uniaxial tension and the breakage morphology in relation to thread count. The M/L ratio is proposed in this paper to investigate the effect of the difference in the thread count between warp and fill direction on the mechanical behavior. The M/L ratio of thread count of 5.5+7.0 specimen is larger than 4.5+4.0 and 5.5+5.0 by 38 % and 41 %, respectively, the corresponding M/T ratio of modulus is larger by 34 % and 29 %, and for strength it is 23 % and 24 %. It is found that the increase of thread count in one direction improves the mechanical properties in this direction but reduces the equivalent elastic modulus and strength in the vertical direction. The simulated stress and strain distribution inside the RUC helps to better understand the influence mechanism of thread count on the mechanical properties of single-ply woven composites.© 2022 Andrew P. J. Stanley et al.In wind plants, turbines can be yawed into the wind to steer their wakes away from downstream turbines and achieve an overall increase in plant power. Mathematical optimization is typically used to determine the best yaw angles at which to operate the turbines in a plant. In this paper, we present a new heuristic to rapidly determine the yaw angles in a wind plant. In this method, we define the turbine yaw angles as Boolean - either yawed at a predefined angle or nonyawed - as opposed to the typical methods of defining yaw angles as continuous or with fine discretizations. We then optimize which turbines should be yawed with an algorithm that sweeps through the turbines from the most upstream to the most downstream. We demonstrate that our new Boolean optimization method can find turbine yaw angles that perform well compared to a traditionally used gradient-based optimizer for which the yaw angles are defined as continuous. There is less than 0.6% difference in the optimized power between the two optimization methods for randomly placed turbine layouts and less than a 0.6% difference in the optimal annual energy production between the two optimization methods for a real wind farm. Additionally, we show that our new method is much more computationally efficient than the traditional method. For plants with nonzero optimal yaw angles, our new method is generally able to solve for the turbine yaw angles 50-150 times faster, and in some extreme cases up to 500 times faster, than the traditional method.

The failures of the power transformer impact critically the grid, can cause energy loss and blackouts. In energy production, transmission, distribution, and industrial applications, the oil immersed power transformer is the most used. The maintenance of this key equipment is highly important which can be done with different techniques such as thermal and vibration analysis, frequency analysis using wavelet transform and dissolved gas analysis. The application of predictive maintenance of the power transformer represents an important feature of the Smart Energy Management System in micro grids, that can reduce the percentage of failure occurrence while increasing the availability of the power transformer and prevents blackouts. This paper represents different failure classification techniques based on dissolved gas analysis data mainly logistic regression, multiclass jungle, multiclass decision tree and artificial neural network. The application can diagnosis the power transformer failures based on the parts-per-million of the different gas generated in the oil. The results of applying different types of classification algorithms shows the best technique to be part of a bigger system of monitoring and diagnostic of different installed equipment in a micro grid. The implementation of such application in real time energy management system requires different type of sensors and the interaction of offline database, the paper also shows the steps to integrate the algorithm in the Smart Energy Management System.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Foodborne pathogenic bacteria detection is an important work, the traditional laboratory identification method, will cause irreversible damage to the sample, and the detection cycle is long.

Each year, banks globally allocate approximately 20 percent of their revenues to innovate and protect their information system. During the coronavirus period, Moroccan banks have faced difficulties serving their customers, which led to the development of a bad relationship between the two sides and negatively affected the financial performance of banks. The Moroccan customers want to have 24/7 access to their banking services on their phones, on the web at home, and in physical branches. Even if digital banking applications have helped to provide options and to ease access to various banking services, many Moroccans who are less technologically engaged prefer in-person banking at the agency, which sometimes leads to overcrowded agencies. It has become necessary for the banks to propose new solutions to serve their customers while reducing the risk of covid-19 virus transmission. In this paper, we will present a solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in order to gain customer satisfaction by minimizing long wait times, reducing the number of people at the agency, reducing close interactions while managing a safe, smooth, and effective customer service.© 2022 IEEE.Classification task is a very popular preprocessing step in different research fields. Its main role is to separate the different components of an object or dataset into homogeneous regions or groups based on the similarity of properties and features. Among the most popular clustering algorithms we cite fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means. In this these iterative techniques, a distance metric between each actual dataset point and the estimated centroids is calculated at each iteration. In this paper, we implement four algorithms; sequential FCM, sequential K-means and their 2 parallel versions. A comparative computational performance study between the sequential and the parallel version is presented. This study, will focus on the execution time of the parallel and sequential implementations in addition to the speed up of the parallel version with respect to the sequential one. The experimental tests were conducted on a randomly generated number dataset. The parallel versions were implemented on a SIMD architecture of Nvidia GPU. The influence of the variation of the data size and the number of clusters on the execution time was analyzed and interpreted.© 2022 Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation.

Recently, several candidates on post-quantum signature schemes, in which the exponentiation operations in a hidden commutative group contained in a non-commutative algebra is used, were proposed. Search for new mechanisms of using a hidden group, while developing signature schemes resistant to quantum attacks, is of significant practical interest. Purpose: Development of a new method for designing post-quantum signature algorithms on finite non-commutative associative algebras. Results: A novel method for developing digital signature algorithms on non-commutative algebras. A new four-dimensional finite non-commutative associative algebra set over the ground field GF(p) have been proposed as algebraic support of the signature algorithms. To provide a higher performance of the algorithm, in the introduced algebra the vector multiplication is defined by a sparse basis vector multiplication table. Study of the algebra structure has shown that it can be represented as a set of commutative subalgebras of three different types, which intersect exactly in the set of scalar vectors. Using the proposed method and introduced algebra, a new post-quantum signature scheme has been designed. The introduced method is characterized in using one of the elements of the signature (e, S) in form of the four-dimensional vector S that is computed as a masked product of two exponentiated elements G and H of a hidden commutative group: S = B-1GnHrC-1, where non-permutable vectors B and C are masking multipliers; the natural numbers n and r are calculated depending on the signed document M and public key. The pair <G, H> composes a minimum generator systems of the hidden group. The signature verification equation has the form R = (Y1SZ1)e(Y2SZ2)e2, where pairwise non-permutable vectors Y1, Z1, Y2, and Z2 are element of the public key and natural number e that is computed depending on the value M and the vector R. Practical relevance: Due to sufficiently small size of public key and signature and high performance, the developed digital signature scheme represents interest as a practical post-quantum signature algorithm. The introduced method is very attractive to develop a post-quantum digital signature standard.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.We introduce our model of spacetime regarded as a 4-dimensional manifold fibred over absolute time.© 2022 Author(s).Nanoparticles of nickel cobalt ferrite (NixCo(1-x) Fe2O4, x=0.2) were prepared by the co-precipitation method for photocatalyst application. The structural characterizations were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The crystallite size for the annealing temperature variation 300°C, 400°C, and 500°C is 15.36 nm,18.70 nm, and 19.35, respectively. This increases the annealing temperature causes a larger crystal size. The density constant decreases while strain and lattice parameters in the sample increase with the annealing temperature. In the spectral analysis, two bands were observed in the range -400-600 cm-1 which confirmed the spinel structure of nanoparticle ferrites. Furthermore, the results of the photocatalyst test were characterized using UV-Vis spectrophotometer obtained bandgap energy of 17.58 × 10-1 eV, 17.63 × 10-1 e, and 17.68 × 10-1 eV.© 2020 American Chemical Society.

The original assignment, which was based on the available database, indicated that the amount of C−O−C/ C−OH was much larger than that of SiO2 at the sliding interface of SiC in water. However, our subsequent simulation of the sliding interface of SiC in water based on first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) showed that the formation of C−O bonds is difficult compared to the formation of Si−O bonds.1 Moreover, a later reactive MD-based simulation of the sliding interface of SiC in water showed that the main product of the tribochemical reaction was SiO2, and there was little formation of C−O−C and C−OH2. On the basis of these newly obtained simulation results, we decided to reinvestigate the XPS peaks.© 2022 IEEE.In Africa, the use of mobile terminals is one of the tools facilitating the exchange and transport of information. And that has increased the number of mobile subscribers. This situation is influenced by other factors such as the theft and sale in the market of many mobile terminals that do not meet the standards required for use. To achieve adequate management, it is vital to firstly state; the state of the art of mobile terminals in circulation in African countries, but also to put in place tools to control the supply chain. These tools will allow regulators from different African countries to control the entire chain better using an architectural model SSTM (System of Supervision and Control of Mobile Terminals), composed of a CEIR (Central Equipment Identifcation Registry), managed by the regulator of each country and the EIR of operators and those of the defence and security forces. These measures will allow the authorities of each country, via their regulatory bodies, to control mobile terminals in circulation and subscribers.Copyright © 2022 Hattori, Hayakawa and Ebihara.The solar activity has been significantly weakened during the Maunder Minimum (MM: 1645–1715), whereas it has been somewhat controversial to reconstruct the actual solar-activity magnitude and the space weather activity in this interval. Here, the East Asian records provide unique references for the low-latitude aurorae in the MM, particularly with the (quasi-)simultaneous candidate auroral accounts in March 1653 and September 1672. These cases have formed unique cases for the intense space weather events and solar-terrestrial interactions in the MM. In particular, the former has been regarded as “virtually incontrovertible evidence” for an intense geomagnetic storm in the Maunder Minimum, despite significant suppression of the solar activity therein. Thus, this record has attracted scientific interpretations on the physical mechanism. However, our philological analyses have traced these source records further back to their original sources and have detected chronological problems in the Japanese source documents. For the 1653 March event, we have identified that the Japanese record retrospectively referred to a hearsay report between 31 December 1652 and 28 January 1653, instead of one on 2 March 1653. Our modification has been verified in two additional contemporary records. In addition, we have further analysed the candidate auroral report of 21 September 1672, which has been subjected to the doubts on the chronological errors. Herein, we have consulted contemporary records and reinforced the revised date of 7 September 1635. Our philological study has cast serious caveats on the reliability of the (quasi-)simultaneous East Asian records for candidate aurorae during the Maunder Minimum, emphasised the importance of philological studies on the auroral records, and highlighted that further discussions are required on the solar–terrestrial environment in the grand solar minima.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryBoroles are well known to undergo ring expansion reactions with organic azides to yield 1,2-azaborinines. A synthon featuring both azide and borole moieties within the same molecule, 1-azido-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylborole, was found to be much less stable than the related, previously-reported azidoborafluorene and decomposed to intractable mixtures well below room temperature. It could, however, be trapped at −75 °C through the formation of Lewis base adducts, even in the form of the “azide-stabilized azidoborole” complex anion diazidoborolate.

WCO was used as a crosslinker to prepare a high-sulfur-content polymer through inverse vulcanization. Polysulfides were generated under vigorous stirring of WCO with elemental sulfur at different temperatures, crosslinking ratios, and reaction times. The physicochemical properties of the produced polysulfides were determined and the thermal stability was analyzed. The FTIR spectra including the breakdown of C=C and formation of C–S bond confirmed the change of functional groups between WCO and produced polymer. The effect of saturated and unsaturated triglycerides of WCO is clearly visible in SEM micrographs. The polysulfide with a 70 wt % sulfur feed ratio showed excellent morphological and thermal properties.© 2022, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

Novel and excellent biometric micromixers have been designed with an effective mechanism of flow splitting and recombining (SAR). The aim of this study is to modify the prototype of a biometric micromixer by designing the inlet flow channel and generating a better flow geometry in the blood vessel-micromixer. The blood vessel-micromixer was also investigated with different inlet channel angles and various Reynolds number ratios (ReI2 and Rer) for the estimation of their influence on the mixing performance of the micro-mixer. The ReI2 is the inlet 2 and the Rer is the combination of side flow and middle flow effects during the different flow conditions. Results showed that the blood vessel-micromixer with an inlet channel angle of 30° (Ø =30°) can be optimized for future research works. In addition, optimal performance with a Amixing index of 0.88 would be achieved at a condition of ReI2= 1 and Rer = 0.7. These findings will be definitely useful for the improvement of micromixer applications in the future.© 2021 Journal of Microscopy and Ultrastructure Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.Background: The pathogenesis of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) still remains conflicting and has been linked to alterations in epithelial thickness, fibrosis, and vascularity. Although changes in these individual parameters have been extensively studied in relation to epithelial dysplasia their combined relation with dysplasia has not been studied much. Any such relation, if present, may further help in understanding this disease process. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between epithelial thickness, fibrosis, and vascularity with dysplasia in OSF. Materials and Methods: The study consisted of 30 OSF patients. Incisional biopsy was taken from the most fibrosed area of the buccal mucosa. Hematoxylin-Eosin-stained slides were assessed for epithelial thickness, fibrosis, and vascularity using image analysis software. The slides were also assessed for epithelial dysplasia. Relationship of epithelial atrophy, fibrosis, and vascularity with dysplasia was assessed using one-way ANOVA. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for evaluating the relationship between epithelial thickness, fibrosis, and vascularity. Results: Epithelial dysplasia was found in all patients. Eleven patients had mild (36. 67%), thirteen had moderate (43.33%), and six had severe (20%) dysplasia. None of the parameters were found to have a significant relationship with dysplasia. However, moderate and positive correlation was found between epithelial thickness and fibrosis. This relation was statistically significant. Conclusion: Positive correlation between epithelial thickness and fibrosis in present study therefore contradicts the hypothesis of fibrosis induced epithelial atrophy. As dysplasia is influenced by multiple factors therefore habits and burning sensation needs to be incorporated in future studies assessing dysplasia in OSF.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.Poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) hydrogels reinforced with TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers were synthesized. The nanofibers were isolated from a local industrial waste, Agave tequilana bagasse, through pulping and bleaching processes followed by a mechanical treatment. Hydrogels containing TEMPO-oxidized nanofibers displayed higher swelling capacity and higher stiffness than hydrogels having untreated nanofibers. These improvements can be attributed to the hydrophilic and highly crystalline nature of the oxidized cellulose nanofibers. The best balance between swelling capacity and mechanical properties was found in hydrogels containing unbleached and TEMPO-oxidized nanofibers at a 0.35 wt% concentration.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Optical Society of India.Ohmic back contact for CIGS solar cell bilayer Mo thin film is deposited by DC sputtering. For the monolithic interconnection of the CIGS solar cell module, the first step is P1 scribing on the Mo layer. Using Nd: YAG 1064-nm nanosecond laser with two different optical setups, first using YAG focusing lens and second YAG f-theta lens with galvo mirrors, P1 scribing process was investigated and optimized. Several parameters such as laser power, pulse repetition rate, scan speed, pass delay, and depth of focus were varied to optimize the P1 scribing process. CIGS solar cell module was fabricated with an optimized bilayer Mo layer, and it has an efficiency of 1.51%. In the present work, low-cost optimization of the P1 isolation process has been studied by reducing the cost of the laser and its configured optics.© 2022 Author(s).Rainfall is one of the climate components that is often used as a reference, especially in agriculture. This thing cannot be separated from the fact that cropping pattern planning will need to pay attention to the amount of rainfall in the future. This research aims to build a rainfall forecasting model at 77 station points in Jember Regency using Statistical Downscaling (SD) technique. SD technique is an effort to connect the circulation of global scale variables (explanatory variables) and local scale variables. ln this research, the global scale variable used is Global Circular Model (GCM) with 3 variables which are precipitation, air temperature, and sea level pressure. The local scale variable used is monthly rainfall data in Jember Regency at 77 station points. The models used are Partial least Square (PLS) multi response, PLS single response, and Principal Component Regression (PCR) models. PLS single response gives a more accurate result compared to other models. This is indicated by the RMSEP value in PLS single response, PLS multi response, and PCR are 64.75, 66.41; and 67.11. But overall, the PLS multi response is more effective and efficient as a functional model for Statistical Downscaling to predict rainfall in Jember Regency. Because the running time on the PLS multi response is shorter than the other two models. PLS multi response provides forecast results at 77 stations in one process, while PLS single response and PCR require 77 processes to provide forecasts at 77 stations.© 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.Abstract: An experimental study of eigenwaves is carried out for EBG waveguides: axial three-row, diagonal five-row, and coupled three-row waveguides based on an electromagnetic crystal that represents an array of circular metal cylinders located inside a planar waveguide. The frequency dependence of the slowing factor of an eigenwave is measured using a resonator technique that employs measurement of the resonance frequencies of a resonator (a short-circuited fragment of an EBG waveguide). Electrodynamic simulation of resonators based on EBG waveguides is carried out. The measured slowing factors are compared with the data obtained using electrodynamic simulation of short-circuited EBG resonators and resonators with periodic boundary conditions. The experimental results are in good agreement with the calculated data.© 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.Technology, market, and competitive dynamics are requiring firms in restaurant/food service supply chains to improve their analytics capabilities, which have tended to lag behind other comparable industries. The global COVID-19 pandemic has further encouraged industrial leaders to evaluate new challenges and opportunities. Our research provides insights into current applications of analytics technologies and organizationally integrates these insights for decision-makers in restaurant supply chains. The study applies decision theory as a framing perspective to this phenomenon, thereby advancing the academic literature on the interface between data management, analytical techniques, and computing. We combine data drawn from interviews of leading players in U.S. and Chinese-based restaurant chains with insights from trade publications and social media posts to identify best practices for analytics usage and supporting organizational changes. Our analysis provides examples of ways in which business leaders are applying analytics technologies to structured and unstructured data to address targeted objectives for demand/supply processes and to foster higher order organizational learning. In keeping with the stated objectives of this special issue of Production and Operations Management, this study provides an overview of both current state-of-the-art and next-generation capabilities for analytics in the restaurant industry. We further identify specific limitations of current processes, opportunities for development and theory-based research, and challenges to implementation.© 2022 Author(s).Spinel lithium containing manganese oxide based on LiMn2O4 have been synthesized by varying synthesis conditions and the study related to the structure have been carried out in order to provide options for the cathode materials produced for secondary lithium-ion battery. We considered wide range synthesis parameters which included the choice of raw materials, synthesis methods, mechanical alloying (MA) parameters, and heat treatment parameters. It is obvious that synthesis parameters are sensitive to the product and determined the structure of the spinel LiMn2O4 and is related to morphology, lattice parameters, crystallite size, oxygen contents, composition of Mn3+ and Mn4+, and cation mixing. In general, synthesis conditions to compromise many parameters in order to obtain stoichiometric LiMn2O4 is the choice of LiOH.H2O and MnOx as raw materials, mix using MA method for 6 hours with ball-to-powder ratio of 40:1 and followed by annealing at 800°C for 4 hours in oxygen gas flow and cooled slowly at rate of 60°C/min. It is necessary to set a proper synthesis condition in an effort to obtained ideal cathode materials for specific application.© 2022 Author(s).Bengawan Solo is a watershed in Indonesia with an area of ±16,100 km2. The Gondang Reservoir Lamongan Post is one of the posts passed by the Bengawan Solo River Basin. Gondang Reservoir has benefits such as supplying field reservoirs and irrigation, providing water, controlling the flood or drought, and tourism objects. However, the flow of the Gondang Reservoir river has a negative side that has the potential to damage, so that it can cause disasters in the form of floods, drought, or broken embankments. Therefore it is necessary to have a control system to reduce the risk of disasters in the future. One of the important components in the watershed is rainfall data. Rainfall is very useful in determining the beginning of the season and evaluating a model. Rainfall forecasting is very important for workers in various sectors to determine the direction of a policy to be drawn up and be able to control the flows of the river in conditions that are not destructive. Forecasting techniques is one of the statistical methods that can be used to predict rainfall data because it provides significant results in predicting time series data in the long term. In this research, the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) method was applied for rainfall forecasting in the Gondang Reservoir. The SSA method consists of two stages, decomposition, and reconstruction. Each stage consists of several parts. The decomposition stage consists of embedding and singular value decomposition. Meanwhile, the reconstruction stage consists of grouping and diagonal averaging. Forecasting was conducted on Gondang Reservoir rainfall data from January 2010 to December 2020. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the SSA method could predict well enough rainfall data in the Gondang Reservoir Lamongan post using L = 32 and 5 groups with an MSE value of 43.87 and MAPE value of 21.28%.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.An Eni initiative Fast 3Digital Subsea was made to identify opportunities for improving Company's Subsea developments in terms of time, quality and cost by applying a new way of working and implementing a new digital tool, the FieldAP/Fieldtwin platform (by FutureOn). The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the comparison made between the conventional way of working and the application of the Fast 3Digital Subsea on subsea tieback projects. Data was collected and analysed for a project using the Fast 3Digital Subsea and the results showed the following key success benefits for Eni projects: time saving, cost reduction and improvement in engineering, quality and safety. The benefits listed above were proved during the engineering phase of the project, however the Fast 3Digital Subsea is expected to lead to similar improvements for the future phases of the projects such as installation, commissioning, maintenance and operation. From a Project point of view, the digital solution is expected to lead to minimum time savings of between 1-2 months from discovery to First Oil. This 1-2 months saving are expected mainly in projects where the critical path is represented by subsea items / flowlines that could benefit from an early procurement, in particular tie-backs to existing facilities (FPSO, FPU, and Onshore Plants). For this paper, an Eni project was chosen as the base case and the impacts on project schedule, cost, quality, and discipline collaboration during the engineering, feasibility and FEED activities were evaluated. The Fast 3Digital Subsea allowed engineers to evaluate multiple scenarios more effectively, increased the quality on the project documentation, allowed to select the optimum field layout configuration at an early stage and to quickly prepare an ITT package. All of the above, showed an average time saving of approximately 30% on field layout preparation, therefore cost saving compared to the conventional way of working were realised. Another significant time saving obtained by implementing a Fast 3Digital Subsea approach was during creating of overall deliverables with time saving of nearly 60% during Pre-FEED activities. All of time savings are broken down in activities and are described in the results section. In terms of marine operation, the selected digital solution allows engineers to assess the subsea deveolopment by visualising geohazards and clashes during SIMOPS, this aspect adds singnificant value to projects for faster decision making whilst taking into consideration safety.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.For a long transport pipeline in service in the east, the thermodynamic change rules along the pipeline during shutdown and restart were simulated and analyzed respectively, and the characteristics of soil temperature field during restart were clarified.

The research of this paper can provide theoretical support for the determination of shutdown time in the process of shutdown.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThe binding of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to ice needs to be mediated by interfacial water molecules. Our previous study of the effect of AFPs on the dynamics of the interfacial water of freezing at its initial stage has shown that AFPs can promote the growth of ice before binding to it. However, whether different AFPs can promote the freezing of water molecules on the basal and the prismatic surfaces of ice still needs further study. In the present contribution, five representative natural AFPs with different structures and different activities that can be adsorbed on the basal and/or prismatic surfaces of ice are investigated at the atomic level. Our results show that the phenomenon of promoting the growth of ice crystals is not universal. Only hyperactive AFPs (hypAFPs) can promote the growth of the basal plane of ice, while moderately active AFPs cannot. Moreover, this significant promotion is not observed on the prismatic plane regardless of their activity. Further analysis indicates that this promotion may result from the thicker ice/water interface of the basal plane, and the synergy of hypAFPs with ice crystals.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Formulations of Quantum Mechanics in a curved spacetime with absolute time and with reference to non inertial observers have been proposed by several authors with different aims and perspectives.© 2022 Optica Publishing Group.Changes in the environment, such as landslides, tsunamis, rising or falling sea levels in coastal oceans, and neighboring land surfaces, significantly impact the structure of the ocean and human life. These natural climate-change processes have unanticipated and deadly consequences for coastal areas. The continental margin part of the ocean has recently attracted the most attention because of the mineral sources and human activities such as exploration, navigation, recreation, and fishing. The continental margin stretches fromthe coastal mountains and plains to continental shelf, slope, and rise, where terrestrial and maritime means meet. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable underwater optical wireless sensor network (UOWSN) based on underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) to monitor and discover continental margin ore deposits. In this proposed system, a transceiver on the underwater wireless autonomous vehicle moving around the different regions of the continental margin collects information and transmits it to the seashore control station once it reaches the ocean surface. We investigated the outage probability and average bit error rate of the proposed system at the continental margin and used coding techniques to mitigate the effects of high turbulence in the continental shelf region.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Big data word is used for datasets whose size and types are beyond traditional data processing systems.

Shear walls have a large lateral stiffness compared to frame systems, and hence, they are often used where control of lateral displacement is imperative. General design objectives for coupled shear walls were summarized from the available literature. Four different configurations of coupling beams with aspect ratios of 2-4 were evaluated using SAP2000 software to obtain an approximate empirical relationship to estimate the degree of coupling of a coupled wall system for a typical four-story hotel-type structure. The proposed equation provides an accurate estimation of the degree of coupling. Using this empirical relationship, a simple procedure to incorporate coupling action into the instantaneous design of shear walls was outlined.© 2022, Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences.

High purity (99.99%) tantalum sheet was used as a target. The current density of the glow discharge during the etching of the target was 20.4 A/m2. Plasma-forming gases were argon or a mixture of argon and oxygen. Three types of coatings of tantalum on titanium were obtained: the first one was tantalum oxide on titanium, the second — tantalum on titanium, and the third — tantalum on titanium with a tantalum oxide sublayer. The effect of a pre-deposited sublayer of tantalum oxide on the hardness and morphology of the “base-coating” system was studied. It was found that of the greatest practical interest is an oxygen-saturated tantalum coating with the thickness of 800 nm deposited on a tantalum oxide sublayer with the thickness of 75 – 80 nm. Nanoindentation of samples with a tantalum-containing coating without a tantalum oxide sublayer revealed an increase in hardness up to 39 GPa and in elastic modulus up to 194 GPa. In case of the deposited tantalum oxide sublayer, the nanoindentation hardness reached 60 GPa, and the elastic modulus was 230 GPa. This superhard two-layer structure had a bimodal hardness distribution and contained a Ta2 O phase with a cubic crystal lattice. In this case, the proportion of measurements related to superhard inclusions was at least 43%. The coating had a heterogeneous structure consisting of agglomerates with a size of 0.4 – 0.5 µm. The chemical composition of the surface layer was characterized by an oxygen content of 17.46 at.%, titanium — within 2.00 at.%, and tantalum — 80.54 at.%. An increase in the proportion of coating agglomerates with a size of 0.2 – 0.3 µm was observed from 53.13 to 68.25% when using a tantalum oxide sublayer. The results make it possible to consider the developed process of obtaining coatings promising for the application of functional layers on titanium medical devices.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.Organic-inorganic hybrid nanofiber webs were prepared through electrospinning of binary polyacrylonitrile/AA for the removal of A(V) and ternary PAN/AA/(photocatalytic ZnO) solutions in DMF for the simultaneous removal of both As(III) and As(V) in water utilizing photocatalytic oxidation of As(III) to As(V). The sorption properties of the hybrid nanofiber webs were evaluated using batch and continuous process. AA was found to be effective not for sorption of As(III) but for As(V) by showing the rejection rates up to 95 % for As(V) and 20 % for As(III). However, As(III) could be effectively removed by using of the ternary hybrid nanofiber web due to photocatalytic oxidation of As(III) to As(V) by ZnO nanoparticles under UV irradiation. Qmax(mg/g sorbent) obtained in the continuous sorption process 3.5 which is higher than 2.4 reported in the other reference. Thus, it was concluded that the ternary hybrid nanowebs were very effective in simultaneous removing both As(V) and more harmful As(III) through photocatalytic oxidation of As(III) to As(V).© 2022 IEEE.Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is the process that concerns the permit of the machines to accept speech input from humans and interpret it with the highest precision probability.

Our obtained experimental results show that the best recognition rate was recorded by Pocketsphinx toolkit.© 2022 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.The tidal tails of Palomar 5 (Pal 5) have been the focus of many spectroscopic studies in an attempt to identify individual stars lying along the stream and characterize their kinematics. The well-studied trailing tail has been explored out to a distance of 15- from the cluster centre, while less than 4° have been examined along the leading tail. In this paper, we present results of a spectroscopic study of two fields along the leading tail that we have observed with the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian telescope. One of these fields lies roughly 7- along the leading tail, beyond what has been previously been explored spectroscopically. Combining our measurements of kinematics and line strengths with Pan-STARRS1 photometric data and Gaia EDR3 astrometry, we adopt a probabilistic approach to identify 16 stars with a high probability of belonging to the Pal 5 stream. Eight of these stars lie in the outermost field and their sky positions confirm the presence of 'fanning' in the leading arm. We also revisit previously published radial velocity studies and incorporate Gaia EDR3 astrometry to remove interloping field stars. With a final sample of 109 bona fide Pal 5 cluster and tidal stream stars, we characterize the 3D kinematics along the the full extent of the system. We provide this catalogue for future modeling work.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Recently, lead-free perovskite solar cell (PSC) heterostructure using CH3NH3SnI3 (MASnI3) absorber layer received significant attention due to their superior device performance. However, the effect of deep defect state on device performance is only little known about the MASnI3 absorber based PSC. In the present study, initially we optimized the power conversion efficiency of the device via the bandgap tuning and electron affinity variations in MASnI3 absorber layer using SCAPS-1D simulator. Thereafter, the capacitance-voltage (C-V), Mott-Shottkey (MS) (1/C2-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) measurements are performed through simulation approach, which confirmed a solid sign of deep defects in the perovskite heterostructure device. In addition, temperature dependent capacitance-frequency (C-f) characteristics confirmed the clear expectancy of thermally-induced variations in capacitance (or dielectric constant) under illumination and dark, respectively. Further, supremacy of the space charge region in MASnI3 based PSC is confirmed from the voltage dependent semicircular nature of the Nyquist plots. Shrink in the semicircles of the Nyquist plots with the increase of the forward bias voltage also confirm the improvement of carriers under forward bias which increase the conductivity and therefore decrease the impedance.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryAlthough the pyrenyl (Py) groups in several dipyrenyl (or bispyrenyl) compounds do not dimerize in the ground-state, they are known to intramolecularly aggregate exclusively in the excited-state to form excimers in common organic solvents. We present contrasting intramolecular aggregation behaviour of such a prototypical compound, 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane [1Py(3)1Py], dissolved in judiciously selected liquids having relatively high dynamic viscosities (η). Specifically, the intramolecular aggregation of 1Py(3)1Py is investigated in a liquid polymer polydimethylsiloxane with number average MW 2000, PDMS2000 (η293.15K = 21.4 mPa s), and is compared with aggregation of 1Py(3)1Py in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) constituted of the H-bond acceptor (HBA) choline chloride (ChCl) and H-bond donors (HBDs) urea and glycerol in a 1 : 2 mole ratio of ChCl : urea (η293.15K = 1372.0 mPa s) and ChCl : Gly (η293.15K = 473.0 mPa s), respectively, in 293.15 to 363.15 K temperature range. The HBD constituent of ChCl : Gly, glycerol (Gly) (η293.15K = 1412.0 mPa s) is also investigated for comparison purposes. It is found that while in PDMS2000, 1Py(3)1Py intramolecularly aggregates exclusively in the excited-state, thus forming a classical excimer, ground-state heterogeneity is clearly evident in both the DESs and Gly. High viscosity, a consequence of the extensive H-bonding in DESs/Gly, appears to induce the two Py units, both in the ground-state, to exist partly in a configuration where the interaction, albeit a weak one, takes place between the two. This ground-state interaction is not present in relatively low viscosity media PDMS2000 as observed in the common organic solvents. The role of viscosity/H-bonding of the solubilizing milieu on differential intramolecular aggregation in ground- and excited-states is highlighted.© 2022 Author(s).Synthesis of colloidal silver nanoparticles has been conducted using pulse laser ablation technique. Compared to chemical technique, pulse laser ablation can be successfully applied to produce silver nanoparticles with high impurity without any reduction chemical agent, thus they are applicable for human-related application such as disinfectant. Experimentally, high purity silver metal was immersed into polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP) liquid. The silver was subsequently bombarded by pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was successfully produced and dispersed in the PVP liquid. The produced AgNPs have a spherical shape with an averaged diameter of 15.6 nm and its light single Plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak at 402 nm. The colloidal AgNPs were then applied as an antibacterial agent to Escherichia coli and Streptococcus aureus. The result certified that a killing rate of 100% for both bacteria was obtained after AgNPs treatment for 30 s. The produced colloidal silver nanoparticles can be employed as a disinfectant.© 2022, The Korean Fiber Society for Fibers and Polymers and Springer.This work investigated the effects of length and oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the interfacial strength, fracture toughness enhancement and conductivity for epoxy matrix composites by experiment. Firstly, a seven-step processing scheme was proposed to obtain highly dispersed CNT-epoxy composites. Subsequently, two feasible methods were presented to characterize the interfacial strength and used to study the effects of length and oxidation of CNTs on the interfacial strength. Thirdly, based on the experimental results of the fracture toughness of CNT-epoxy composites, we proposed a new fracture theory for CNT-based composites which is contrary to the conventional fracture theory for fiber-based composites. The experimental results show that the fracture toughness enhancement reaches maximum at the critical oxidation time, when the interfacial strength equals CNT strength. At last, to obtain CNT-epoxy composites with both high mechanical and electrical properties, a feasible solution was put forward.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Blockchain is a computational data structure that provides open and distributed and decentralized public ledger technology that has many promising applications.

In contrast, the complexity of the motor structure and the manufacturing cost are low, and only one-way operation is required. The control strategy is simple. Based on the analysis of the self-starting mechanism of the two-phase switched reluctance motor with variable air-gap rotor structure, the structure scheme of the variable airgap rotor is determined by the finite element method. Two-dimensional model of two-phase switched reluctance motor with vertical air gap structure. To minimize the electromagnetic torque ripple, the structure parameters of the motor such as air gap, stator-rotor pole arc and winding turns are optimized. To solve the finite element optimization simulation time process, a numerical batch interpolation method is developed to optimize the non-uniform pole arc of the rotor to improve the finite element simulation speed. Finally, the fixed-rotor pole arc and winding turns of the motor are optimized. The motor parameters are further optimized to make the static performance of the motor more stable.© 2022 RSCAn intrinsic large valley splitting has been realized in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures formed by monolayer MoTe2 and layered room-temperature ferromagnetic MnSe2via first-principles calculations. The value of valley splitting of MoTe2 can reach 106 meV among a variety of stacking MoTe2/MnSe2 heterobilayers, which is equivalent to the effective Zeeman splitting in an external magnetic field of 530 T. And the magnitude of valley splitting can be further enhanced by applying external vertical-stress and biaxial compressive strain. To obtain a higher operating temperature, a biaxial tensile strain of 2.3% has been applied on the monolayer MnSe2 magnetic substrate, and the corresponding Curie temperature increased from an intrinsic value of 266 K to 353 K, but the valley splitting can still remain as large as 72 meV. This means that we can strike a balance between large valley splitting and high Curie temperature, which is vital for the application of magnetic valley electronic devices.Copyright ©2022 Applied Mathematics and Mechanics.

The non-limit states of the soil layers at different depths are different in this pattern, and present difficulties for soil stress calculation. Based on the existing research, the functional relationship between soil strength parameters of the wall footing rotation pattern and wall displacements were detruded. Under the assumption that the backfill forms a circular arch and the slip surface is uncertain, the backfill was divided into long horizontal slices, the numerical iteration scheme for the nonlimit-state active earth pressure in the wall footing rotation pattern was constructed, and the numerical calculation method for the active earth pressure was given. The numerical method not only determines the slip surface shape, but calculates the intensity, the resultant force and the action point of the nonlimit-state active earth pressure. The backfill slip surface is a curved one and the new numerical solution is more consistent with the existing full-scale test results than the existing analytical results. This work provides more accurate numerical solutions of the nonlimit-state active earth pressure on the rigid retaining wall in the footing rotation pattern, and makes a practical guide to design of such retaining walls.© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of process parameters on the film quality and film surface morphology was investigated, and the relationship between the growth rate of the films and the concentration of the reaction solution as well as the number of cycles was studied and analyzed. The experimental conditions for the preparation of CuI films with the highest transmittance were as follows: the concentration of the anion driving solution was 0.075 mol/L. The film thickness of the CuI films increased with the number of cycles, and films with a thickness of 1.73μm could be produced in 40 cycles. The films were tested by XRD and SEM and showed high purity, flat and dense surface.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.In this paper, a controllable band-stop filter based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) is presented using complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications. Four CSRRs are inserted on the ground plane to achieve the required band rejection characteristics. The filter cutoff frequency is controlled by changing the depth of the SSPP grooves. Frequency and bandwidth of the stopband are controlled by adjusting the geometric parameters and position of the CSRRs, respectively. The Control process of the stopband is independent of the filter cutoff frequency, so adjusting the stopband does not change the cutoff frequency. Two prototypes of the proposed filter with different CSRR diameters are fabricated. The measured 20 dB rejection bandwidth for the prototypes with the CSRR diameters of 3.2 and 4 mm are 10.5–11.2 and 7.8–8.6 GHz, respectively. Measured cutoff frequency is about 13.1 GHz for both fabricated filters, which indicates that stopband control does not change the cutoff frequency. Simulation and measurement results show excellent rejection performance, so the proposed filter can be used for UWB applications.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this paper, a method of plant image processing combined with BP neural network was proposed to predict the disease degree of brassica napus.

Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study used an electronic survey questionnaire comprising 18 questions. An electronic survey was distributed through social networking sites during the period from November 1 to November 15, 2014, followed by data analysis. Results: Data from 1808 questionnaires were collected and analyzed. The results showed that 61% of the participants used analgesics without prescription; 67% used analgesics only for severe pain; 72% stated that analgesics could be administered with other medications; 68% reported that analgesics had an antipyretic effect; and only 1% reported that they had an anti-inflammatory effect. Further, 80% of the participants had the habit of reading drug product information and 77% were careful about the expiry date. Conclusions: The general population showed inadequate knowledge and attitudes toward OTC analgesics. Therefore, more programs to increase awareness and health education among patients are needed.© 2022 IEEE.Accessibility to medical knowledge andhealthcare costs are the two major impediments for the commonman.

However, tremendous attention has been focused on introducing specific dynamic covalent bonds or noncovalent bonds into the molecular structures of thermosetting polymers, which requires choosing or synthesizing particular monomers, greatly limiting the industrial application potential. Herein, we have devised and prepared a series of conventional thermosetting polyurea elastomers (TPUEs) by utilizing the commercial raw materials of poly(propylene oxide)diamine and different diisocyanate monomers. These TPUEs have remarkable solvent resistance, great thermal stability, and outstanding transparency in the visible light range. In particular, the toughness, the breaking strength, and the elongation at break of TPUEs can reach maximum values of 300 MJ m−3, 31.4 MPa, and 1752%, respectively, making them superior to most dynamic materials and commercial elastomers that exhibit exceptional mechanical properties. Surprisingly, the TPUEs devised here have a superior dynamic nature owing to the classic urea bond, as confirmed via analysis of small molecules and dynamic properties, such as stress-relaxation and creep-recovery. These TPUEs can maintain remarkable mechanical properties, chemical stability, and solvent resistance after being recycled multiple times. Additionally, we propose a universal mechanism by which these TPUEs can simultaneously have mechanically robust properties in the range from the glass transition temperature of the soft segment (Tgs) to their topology freezing-transition temperature (Tv) (about −40 °C to 150 °C) and excellent recyclability at temperatures ranging from Tv to the thermal decomposition temperature (Td) (about 150 °C to 220 °C). Integration of mechanical robustness and a dynamic nature into one network can provide a facile way to solve the recyclability issues relating to conventional TPUEs.© 2022, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd.

First of all, the failure mechanism analysis shows that the degradation process of photovoltaic modules is mainly manifested as the attenuation of output power, which has monotonous and random characteristics, and the initial degradation also has random characteristics, so as to establish the inverse Gaussian performance degradation model with time shift of photovoltaic modules. Then, based on the maximum likelihood estimation method, the model parameters and reliability functions are estimated. Finally, based on the model, an example of photovoltaic module degradation is analyzed, and compared with the traditional inverse Gaussian degradation model, the results show that the model can describe the degradation law of photovoltaic modules more accurately, and the reliability estimation results are more in line with the reality.© 2022 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.Multifield inflation models and non-Bunch-Davies vacuum initial conditions both predict sizeable non-Gaussian primordial perturbations and anisotropic μ-type spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody. While CMB anisotropies allow us to probe non-Gaussianity at wavenumbers k≃ 0.051, μ-distortion anisotropies are related to non-Gaussianity of primordial perturbation modes with much larger wavenumbers, k≃ 740, Mpc-1. Through cross-correlations between CMB and μ-distortion anisotropies, one can therefore shed light on the aforementioned inflation models. We investigate the ability of a future CMB satellite imager like LiteBIRD to measure μT and μE cross-power spectra between anisotropic μ-distortions and CMB temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropies in the presence of foregrounds, and derive LiteBIRD forecasts on fNLμ (k≃ 740Mpc-1)}. We show that μE cross-correlations with CMB polarization provide more constraining power on fNLμ than μT cross-correlations in the presence of foregrounds, and the joint combination of μT and μE observables adds further leverage to the detection of small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity. For multifield inflation, we find that LiteBIRD would detect {fNLμ }=4500 at 5σ significance after foreground removal, and achieve a minimum error of {\sigma (fNLμ =0) ≃ 800} at 68 per cent CL by combining CMB temperature and polarization. Due to the huge dynamic range of wavenumbers between CMB and μ-distortion anisotropies, such large fμ NL values would still be consistent with current CMB constraints in the case of very mild scale dependence of primordial non-Gaussianity. Anisotropic spectral distortions thus provide a new path, complementary to CMB B-modes, to probe inflation with LiteBIRD.© 2022 Optica Publishing Group.Although many studies on cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) microdroplet single-mode lasers are available, it has been shown that the stability and tunability of such microdroplets are difficult to achieve simultaneously. In this paper, a new, to the best of our knowledge, method is proposed for the mass and rapid preparation of stable and tunable monodisperse CLC microdroplet single-mode lasers. This is based on the formation of polymer networks on the surface of the microdroplet via interfacial polymerization and a disruption of the orderliness of the polymer networks by increasing the temperature during polymerization, which results in a single pitch inside the microdroplets. This approach enables CLC microdroplet single-mode lasers to achieve improved environmental robustness, while maintaining the same temperature tunability as the unpolymerized sample. Our method has promising future applications in integrated optics, flexible devices, and sensors.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryIn this work, ammonium oxofluorotitanates, including (NH4)2TiOF4 and NH4TiOF3, are synthesized via the in situ hydrolysis of (NH4)2TiF6 produced by the field-assisted dissolution of freshly grown TiO2 during the high-field anodization of titanium in an NH4F-containing ethylene-glycol-based electrolyte. The obtained ammonium oxofluorotitanate products have a mesocrystalline structure consisting of 3D nanocrystalline building units aligned in an orderly fashion, which are self-assembled via a typical non-classical crystallization process, i.e., oriented particle attachment. (NH4)2TiOF4 with various morphologies, such as plates, rods and a unique cross-like structure, is obtained within a few minutes of reaction. As the reaction continues, an unexpected transformation process from (NH4)2TiOF4 crosses to NH4TiOF3 disks is recorded. NH4TiOF3 nucleates and grows in situ from the center of an (NH4)2TiOF4 cross with the continuous consumption of (NH4)2TiOF4, and a pure-phase NH4TiOF3 disk is finally obtained. Upon thermal annealing, all the obtained ammonium oxofluorotitanates, including the pure-phase (NH4)2TiOF4 crosses, (NH4)2TiOF4 crosses with an NH4TiOF3 disk at the center, and pure-phase NH4TiOF3 disks, could be converted to micrometer-sized mesocrystalline anatase TiO2 composed of nanocrystalline sub-units while maintaining their exterior morphologies. Physicochemical information related to the growth and transformation of the products is discussed.This journal is © The Royal Society of ChemistryEnantioseparation of chiral molecules is an important aspect of life sciences, chemical syntheses, and physics. Yet, the prevailing chemical techniques are not effective. Recently, a few types of plasmonic apertures have been theoretically proposed to distinguish between chiral molecules that vary based on their handedness under circularly polarized illumination. Both analytic calculations and numerical simulation demonstrated that enantioselective optical sieving could be obtained at the nanoscale using a large chiral optical force based on plasmonic resonance enhanced near-field chiral gradients in the aperture. Nevertheless, scaling this scheme to chiral entities of a few nanometer size (i.e., proteins and DNA) faces formidable challenges owing to the fabrication limit of a deeply sub-nanometer aperture and the intense power levels needed for nanoscale trapping. In contrast, by extending the Friedrich-Wintgen theory of the bound states in the continuum (BIC) to photonics, one may explore another mechanism to obtain enantioselective separation of chiral nanoparticles using all-dielectric nanostructures. Here, we present a metasurface composed of an array of silicon (Si) nanodisks embedded with off-set holes, which supports a sharp high-quality (Q) magnetic dipolar (MD) resonance originating from a distortion of symmetry-protected BIC, so called quasi-BIC. We, for the very first time, show that such a quasi-BIC MD resonance can markedly improve the chiral lateral force on the paired enantiomers with linearly polarized illumination. This quasi-BIC MD resonance can enhance the chirality density gradient with alternating sign at each octant around the Si nanodisk, while exhibiting a small gradient for the electromagnetic (EM) density. This offers a chiral lateral force that is 1 order larger in magnitude compared to the non-chiral lateral forces on sub-2 nm chiral objects with a chirality parameter of ±0.01. Moreover, the quasi-BIC MD resonance can excite four pairs of diverse optical potential wells (−13kBT) that are distributed uniformly along the outer edge of the resonator, enabling a simultaneous separation of four paired enantiomers. Our proposed dielectric metasurface may move forward the techniques of enantioseparation and enantiopurification, taking a novel perspective to advanced all-optical enantiopure synthesis.© 2022 Kaiwen Luo et al.To reveal the pharmacokinetic process of narirutin, naringin, and honokiol in normal and different courses of liver-stagnation and spleen-deficiency syndrome depressive rats after intragastric administration of Zhi-Zi-Hou-Po decoction (ZZHPD), a rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was proposed in this study. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat was employed as the depression model. Acetonitrile solution containing 0.1% acetic acid and methyl alcohol-water (50: 50, v/v) was chosen as the protein precipitant and redissolve solution severally; a Shim-pack GISS C18 column coupled with 0.1% aqueous acetic acid-acetonitrile in gradient elution was employed to separate the mixed constituents in plasma. The WinNonLin software (version 6.1) was chosen as the analytical tool for the pharmacokinetic parameters. The results indicated that compared with rats in the control group, the sucrose preference, scores in the open-field test, and the concentration of 5-HT in plasma of rats in CUMS and CUMS + ZZHPD treatment groups were lower, while the immobility time in the forced swimming test of rats in these two groups was longer, which implied that the depression model was successful. These behavioral and biochemical indexes of rats above in the CUMS + ZZHPD treatment group were improved after oral administration of ZZHPD, which indicated that the antidepressant effect of ZZHPD was definite. The UHPLC-MS/MS method was stabilized, sensitive, and exclusive, and the extraction recovery and matrix effect of three analytes were all above 89%. The Tmax, AUC, and Cmax of three ingredients in CUMS-induced depression rats were significantly larger than control rats, while these pharmacokinetic parameters in CUMS + ZZHPD treatment rats were decreased significantly compared with CUMS-induced depression rats, which may relate with the changes in physiological function of the gastrointestinal tract and liver in CUMS-induced liver-stagnation and spleen-deficiency syndrome depressive rats. This study provided important information for the clinical rational use of ZZHPD in antidepressant treatment.© 2022 Author(s).In this study, the mass ratio of hemicellulose to lignin in biomass was changed to explore the interaction among three components of biomass in the gasification process. The experimental values were compared with the predicted values based on the gasification data of each single component. In the experiment, the reaction temperature was 1000 °C, and the air equivalent ratio was 0.25. The obtained gas components and gasification indexes showed that the interaction among three components was significant. Under the mass ratio of cellulose:hemicellulose:lignin = 5:4:1, hemicellulose, respectively, improved H2 yield, carbon conversion efficiency, gasification efficiency, and calorific value by 44.58%, 22.05%, 19.60%, and 18.50% in contrast to the predicted values. Under the mass ratio of cellulose:hemicellulose:lignin = 5:1:4, lignin increased the tar yield to 4.46 mg/g and the percentage increase reached 75.59%. In addition, the experimental results of ash showed that both straw ash and pine ash improved the yields of H2 and CO and gasification efficiency, and the improvement effect of pine ash was better. The experimental results of component connection morphology showed that the actual component connection morphology of biomass inhibited the formation of H2 and CO, reduced the gasification efficiency, and promoted the formation of tar.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In present work, the aerodynamic characteristics and the infrared radiation (IR) features of the spherical convergent flap nozzle (SCFN) under vector actuating operations have been studied numerically. The infrared radiation (IR) features of the nozzle under different vector actuation angle have been studied using the reverse Monte-Carlo method (RMCM). Several parameters, such as IR intensity, radiation brightness, and the spectral radiant intensity of the nozzle, are analyzed in detail. The results show that SCFN radiation intensity distribution gradually transitions from two-peak distribution to single-peak distribution. When the pitching motion is activated, the "second peak"located downstream of the deflection vector angle is gradually weakened and disappears. The peak gradually approaches the peak of the mixer, and the contribution of the mixer gradually dominates. With the increase of geometric vector angle in the pitching direction, the detection angle of the nozzle's infrared radiation intensity peak is less than the geometric vector angle, meanwhile the decrease of the peak value of the infrared radiation intensity of the nozzle is parabolic with the geometric vector angle. Along the direction of the pitching operation, the average value of the infrared radiation at a detection angle of -35° to 35° decreases linearly. When the yaw motion is activated, the infrared radiation intensity distribution in the backward direction of the nozzle exhibits a single-peak feature, and the detection angle at which the peak is located is also smaller than its geometric vector angle. Using the detection angle of the peak as the axis of symmetry, the curve of the infrared radiation intensity distribution behind the nozzle is symmetrical. As the geometric vector angle in the yaw direction increases, along the direction of the pitching operation, both the average value of infrared radiation at a detection angle of -35° to 35° and the peak value of the backward infrared integrated radiation intensity of the nozzle decrease linearly. Besides, the maximum drop is much smaller than the maximum drop during pitching operation.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.Weld mechanical as well as metallurgical properties are widely affected by the flux composition. Selection of flux composition play an important role in determining the good bead quality and mechanical properties of the welded joint. By using laboratory developed agglomerated rutile basic fluxes a study has been carried out to predict the element transfer behaviour in submerged arc welding process (SAW). With the application of mathematical experiments of mixture design approach different statistical model were developed in terms of flux constituents. Using twenty one rutile basic submerged arc welding fluxes a series of bead on plate weld deposits were made at constant welding parameters. Twenty one submerged arc welding fluxes were prepared as per mixture design approach for SiO2-CaO-TiO2 & Al2O3-SiO2-CaO flux system. Regression models were developed in terms of individual, binary and ternary mixture flux constituents for different ∆ quantities. Mathematical regression models have been checked for 95% significance level by using F-test. Results indicates that there was predominant effect on weld metal carbon, silicon, manganese, sulphur, phosphorous, molybdenum and chromium contents. Individual flux ingredients CaO and SiO2, has synergistic effect on ∆C and increases its weld bead carbon content while TiO2 and Al2O3 shows antisynergistic effect on ∆C and decreases the delta carbon content in weld region.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryElectrodes for electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) are coated with thin films using drop-casting and evaporation-assisted self-assembly.

Based on the obtained results, specific parameters for the HadesMiMC encryption algorithm and the Poseidon hash function were determined, which allow them to be used for recurrent SNARK-proofs based on MNT-4 and MNT-6 triplets. It is also shown how better to choose S-boxes for these algorithms, so that this choice was optimal both in terms of stability and in terms of complexity of calculations in SNARK-proofs. It is determined how many rounds are sufficient to guarantee the stability of algorithms for different options. The number of constraints per bit is calculated for different options, and it is shown that it is significantly smaller than for the Pedersen function, which is currently used in the cryptocurrency Zcash. The significant advantages of the considered HadesMiMC block encryption algorithm and the corresponding Poseidon hash function when using these cryptographic primitives in the blockchain as a decentralized environment, an additional function of which is to ensure the anonymity of personal information, are substantiated. These advantages are both a reasonably high level of resistance to known attacks on such cryptographic primitives, and a significant increase in speed (up to 15 times) in the construction of appropriate SNARK-proofs, which are an integral part of the mechanisms of anonymity in the blockchain. The results showed that the HadesMiMC block encryption algorithm, based on operations over a simple finite field, is secure against linear and differential cryptanalysis, with the correct choice of parameters of this algorithm. As a result, the Poseidon hash function, built using the SPONGE design and the HadesMiMC permutation, will be stable. It was also shown how the parameters of the algorithm should be selected to ensure its specified level of security. In addition, the number of constraints per bit of information was calculated and it was shown that the HadesMiMC algorithm and the Poseidon hash function currently have no competitors when used in SNARK-proofs.© 2022, ASM International.Additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as an outstanding technique for obtaining complex geometries and custom parts, without the material loss of conventional subtractive manufacturing processes. In this work, AISI 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), and its microstructure was characterized by several techniques. Tensile tests with in situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using synchrotron radiation. Stress–strain curves and diffractograms were obtained for the as-printed AM 316L, annealed AM 316L and conventional/rolled 316L samples for comparison. The results indicated lower ductility for the AM samples when compared to the sheet. This can be a result of the remaining porosity associated with the AM process. The annealing of the AM samples led to a reduction of the residual stress and an improvement of ductility without significant loss on the ultimate tensile strength. In situ XRD data indicated that AM samples did not undergo phase transformation during straining, maintaining a fully austenitic microstructure and preventing a transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect. On the other hand, in the rolled sample, peaks of α′-martensite were identified. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements indicated that a random texture was achieved by the parameters and scanning strategy used. The results indicate that process parameters must be carefully chosen in order to avoid porosity, and excessive residual stresses, features that directly affect the mechanical behavior of the material.© 2022.

This is not only due to continuous depletion of fossil fuel reserves but also for day by day increasing global warming. This global warming is mainly due to emission of harmful gases from manufacturing industries and vehicles used for transportation including aerial vehicles. In this paper, an experimental study has been performed in variation of mean cylinder pressure at crank angles divided into 4 categories for each stroke. 180° actual movement of crankshaft is taken as 90° for study. Further analysis is done for all the four strokes starting from power stroke at 0° and end of compression stroke as 360° (actually 720°). The fuel used for the study is a 20% blend of biodiesel named as B20 in the paper. The experimental results obtained in a variable compression ratio engine are compared with the corresponding characteristics of fossil fuel. Diesel named as D100 which is a proved and widely used fuel at present. The comparative study has shown a clear indication that though biodiesel blend B100 may not be suitable in, as it’s condition but blend B20 may be suitable to be used in as is condition as the experimental results are not varying largely with that of pure diesel. Variation in power strokes and exhaust strokes were found to have larger deviation from linear trend whereas it followed linear variation in induction and compression stroke. The performance can be improved further by using suitable additive in further research works.© 2022, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.Influences of grain size and low energy Σ boundaries on intergranular corrosion (IGC) resistance of low and high nitrogen containing 316L austenitic stainless steel (ASS) have been investigated in this study after solutionising and sensitisation heat treatments. With increase in solutionising temperature, an increase in average grain size with a larger distribution (larger standard deviation) was also observed. Variation of grain size was larger in the low nitrogen containing ASS as compared to that of high nitrogen containing ASS. Full width half maximum (FWHM) was observed to increase with increasing solutionising temperature and grain size in both the steels. However, relatively finer grains accompanied by higher FWHM were observed in high nitrogen containing ASS. The IGC resistance of solutionised and sensitised steels was studied using double-loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) method. It was observed that the degree of sensitisation (DOS) had reduced significantly in high nitrogen containing ASS after sensitisation heat treatments. Improved IGC resistance of steel with increased nitrogen content could be attributed to the increased fraction of low energy Σ boundaries.© 2022 The Royal Society of ChemistryThermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compounds are promising materials used in emissive layers of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Their main benefit is that they allow the internal quantum efficiency of the OLED to reach up to 100% by converting non-radiative triplet states into radiative singlets. Besides the importance of having a high reverse intersystem-crossing rate, which governs triplet conversion, minimizing the non-radiative decay processes is also extremely important to reach high efficiency. In this study we provide a new method to quantify not only the most important decay rates involved in the TADF process, but also the non-radiative decay rates of both singlet and triplet states individually from transient and steady state experimental optical data. In addition, the different contribution that the two non-radiative decay pathways have on the internal quantum efficiency is investigated. Finally, the method is applied to experimental data from two TADF materials.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.A sliding mode control method of surface mount permannent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM) based on disturbance observer was proposed to solve the problem of internal parameter disturbance caused by temperature change during PMSM operation. Firstly, a disturbance observer based on parametric disturbance is established. Secondly, a new double power approach law is used to design the speed ring controller, and the stability of the controller and observer is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. The results turns out that the new method can clearly improve the performance of the motor, weaken chattering, enhance the robustness and anti-interference ability.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Chemical EOR processes based on surfactants are highly constrained by chemicals losses due to retention in porous media. Surfactant adsorption is usually considered as the main retention mechanism. It can lead to a decrease in process efficiency and to an increase in costs. Among the factors impacting surfactant adsorption – namely reservoir rock mineralogy, brine composition and chemicals types — mineralogy is known to be prominent with an impact that is hard to predict and should be dealt with. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the importance of reservoir rock mineralogy on laboratory design and performance evaluation of surfactant-based EOR processes, using several field cases as illustrations. First, the main effects of the various factors quoted above on surfactant adsorption will be presented. Then a summary of the mitigation strategies that can be applied on field, based on either brines treatments, chemical selection or specific injections processes, will be presented. Four representative cases studies of Surfactant-Polymer process design and evaluation at the lab scale on different mineralogies and conditions will be discussed. Each of them exhibits specific hurdles and requires solutions to mitigate mineralogy impact on designed process. Oil recovery corefloods on reservoir rock were conducted with surfactant in effluent and oil production measurements. Mineralogy analysis were also conducted using XRD, SEM and NMR experiments. The first case focuses on a low clay – low temperature sandstone, an apparently simple case which nonetheless shows a very high and unexpected surfactant adsorption due to a very particular clay repartition. The second case focuses on a high clay — high temperature sandstone: this expectedly difficult case was mitigated by the use of adsorption inhibitors, leading to a good oil recovery and a low adsorption. The third case focuses on an unconsolidated – low clay sandstone containing heavy oil which shows a pronounced sensitivity to fine mobilization by surfactant-polymer process. The selected solution was an adapted brine treatment. The last case focuses on a high temperature carbonate which classically shows high adsorptions. A combined process using brine treatment and adsorption inhibitor resulted in particularly low surfactant adsorption of 60 μg/g. Mineralogy is shown to be a key factor that controls surfactant adsorption in chemical EOR processes. Using representative mineralogy in the lab feasibility studies is therefore mandatory to design relevant Surfactant-Polymer processes. This review demonstrates that efficient strategies can be developed to mitigate the impact of mineralogy on SP chemical EOR processes in a wide range of challenging conditions.© 2022 Commonwealth of Australia [2022].

The usually small apparent proper motion of distant extragalactic targets allow us to realize the fundamental celestial reference frame with VLBI observations. However, long-term astrometric monitoring may reveal extreme changes in some AGN positions. Using new VLBI observations in 2018-2021, we show here that four extragalactic radio sources (3C 48, CTA 21, 1144+352, 1328+254) have a dramatic shift in their positions by 20-130 mas over two decades. For all four sources, the apparent positional shift is caused by their radio structure change.© 2022, Gruppo Italiano Frattura.

This technique ameliorates the mechanical and physical comportment of the soil. Based on this, this research paper aims at investigating the mechanical behaviour of a specific type of dried-cemented-sandy soil reinforced with discrete elements such as polypropylene fibre basically through experimental tests. The latter is a series of consolidated drained triaxial tests which were carried out on sand samples that are prepared with 0, 3 and 6% of cement, reinforced with 1% of polypropylene fibre (12, 18 mm) randomly distributed. Furthermore, those contents are measured by the volume of dry sand. In addition to these tests, the mechanical properties of two types of reinforced sand obtained experimentally, were used in a numerical analysis of a road embankment using a finite element program such as Plaxis 2D in order to observe the variation of different parameters like safety factor and the displacements (Ut, Ux, Uy). The test results showed that the addition of cement and polypropylene fibre of different accommodations increased both cohesion and friction angle of sands while the numerical results indicated that the presence of these additions improved the safety factor and decreased significantly the displacements.© 2022 by the authors.

We consider chains of ‘classical’ two-state Ising spins and their discrete deterministic dynamics as an ontological model with an unitary evolution operator generated by pair-exchange interactions. A simple error mechanism is identified, which turns them into quantum mechanical objects: chains of qubits. Consequently, an interaction between a quantum mechanical and a ‘classical’ chain can be introduced and its consequences for this quantum-classical hybrid can be studied. We found that such hybrid character of composites, generally, does not persist under interactions and, therefore, cannot be upheld consistently, or even as a fundamental notion à la Kopenhagen interpretation, within CAI.© 2022 Author(s).In the food and beverage industry, drying is one of the most important factors in maintaining the durability of these foods. The technology that is often used is to use the spray drying method which converts the extraction of food and beverages into solid powder. In spray drying, air is used as the drying medium. So that air conditions are the main focus. One of the most frequently used air conditioning techniques is dehumidification, which is by reducing the moisture content in the air by using a liquid desiccant as the working medium. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution was chosen because it is safe for food. During the dehumidification process, over time the CaCl2 solution will reach a saturation point where it loses its ability to absorb water vapor in the air. Therefore a regeneration process is needed to restore its ability, namely by using a regenerator or humidifier which in this study uses a counter flow type of flow. This study aims to examine the effect of temperature variations of CaCl2 on humidifier performance as read from changes in air temperature and humidity and the data obtained have been validated by previous research. From this study it was found that the higher the temperature of CaCl2, the higher the addition of moisture in the air, which means that more water vapor is lost in the CaCl2 solution.© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Hydrogel-based soft, wet devices receive a great deal of attention in advanced medical engineering, which will require integration of hydrogels and elastomers through a transparent and tightly bound interface. Here, the strength of the mechanical interlock of the hydrogel–elastomer interface is studied using microstructured poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sheets embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel. The PDMS sheet, which exhibits micro-protrusions (cuboid and frustum-shape), has a tensile strength of 10 kPa, which can be sufficient for gentle handling of the PVA/PDMS assembly. The PDMS protrusions (even the frustum-shape) are found to drag out from the deformed PVA hydrogel without any destruction. The tensile strength of the embedded PDMS is further increased by attaching a thin roof film to bridge the protrusions. These microbridge structures are more than ten times stronger than those with only protrusions, and extraction of the PDMS microbridges caused the destruction of PVA hydrogel. It is also confirmed by a 90°-peeling test that the microbridge structure is effective for tough lamination of the PVA on PDMS. The PVA/PDMS assembly with the microbridged interface exhibits transparency and deformability that will be sufficient for biomedical applications.© 2022 RSCIn the present work, a porous 2D carbon-based sustainable, rapid, and efficient oxidase mimic for ascorbic acid (A.A.) detection has been discussed. Here, Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) biomass waste was used as a precursor, which resulted in advanced N, O-doped hierarchically porous 2D carbon. In this, the heteroatom-like N, O are well-dispersed while 2D carbon has a high surface area. For this, a one-step carbonizing technique was used in an inert environment without any surfactant/activating chemical aid. The structural parameters of such a 2D carbon material were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoluminescence spectroscopic techniques. The morphological investigations of 2D carbon were done by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Nanozymes, also called nanomaterials having the behaviors of enzymes, are promising materials for biomedical fields. Due to the absence of corrosive H2O2 in the reaction path, oxidase-like nanozymes are gaining more importance and attention. Due to the high surface area and N, O-doped hierarchical pores, the 2D carbon possessed more catalytic active sites and facilitated rapid oxidase-like activity for the chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The oxidation culminated in a charge-transfer product with an absorbance peak at 652 nm. Ascorbic acid is a biomolecules that displays concentration-dependent inhibition property over the oxidase activity of a nanozyme. We developed a colorimetric technique based on a 2D carbon oxidase nanozyme for A.A. sensing. Based on this principle, the presented colorimetric method showed an excellent linearity range from 1 to 70 μM with a 0.26 μM detection limit and the fastest A.A. detection among the other reported colorimetric methods. This work demonstrates a simple approach for preparing a complete metal-free and efficient nanozyme, and explored its use for A.A. detection in orange, lemon, grapes, and human serum. Also, it presents a new avenue to design a sustainable mimetic substrate and further a road map for transforming biowastes into new technology.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.This paper deals with the effect of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow for a couple of stress fluids on an exponentially stretching sheet. The magnetic field is implemented normally to the surface. To observe the transfer of heat phenomenon, the Cattaneo–Christov flux model of heat is employed. Using similarity transformation, the substantial differential equations are reformed into ordinary differential equations. Eventually, the effects of different physical parameters are studied graphically. The drawback in Fourier heat flux model is removed by adding a new paramter known as thermal relaxation time by Cattaneo. This perimeter allows heat transportation by way of propagation of waves thermally at a defined speed. After this, the Cattaneo law is further modified by Christov–Christov to replace the ordinary derivative along Oldroyd's upper-convective derivative.© 2022 IEEE.Aiming at the characteristics of temperature control equipment with good energy saving and demand response potential, a temperature control equipment energy consumption control system based on the cyber physical system (CPS) architecture is proposed. Based on the two-Tier architecture of a typical CPS system, the unit level realizes the dynamic information perception, standardized information modeling and control of temperature control equipment through the intelligent energy-using terminal; the system-level implements multiple information fusion and edge computing through the intelligent energy-using gateway to achieve Energy efficiency analysis, energy efficiency diagnosis and coordinated control of multiple devices for residential temperature control equipment. Relying on the proposed interactive architecture and CPS model, using the relevant information sensed by the CPS unit, at the CPS decision-making level, an optimized control strategy for temperature control equipment based on cloud model theory is proposed. The consumption has dropped significantly.© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.The sluggish kinetics of CO2 reduction and evolution reaction (CRR and CER) on the Li–CO2 battery cathode seriously hindered its practical application. Rational design of the Ru/C interface is expected to simultaneously decrease the free energy barrier of intermediate species and create a favorable electronic structure, effectively promoting the catalytic reaction kinetics of the CRR and CER. Herein, a 3D self-supporting cellulose carbon aerogel (CCA) with well-defined Ru/C interfaces (Ru@CCA) is synthesized as an advanced CO2-breathing cathode for Li–CO2 batteries. The results show that the energy efficiency significantly improves to 80% with a high discharge capacity of 10.71 mA h cm−2 at 20 µA cm−2, and excellent cyclic stability of 421 cycles at 100 µA cm−2. These outstanding performances are highly competitive compared with state-of-art Li–CO2 cathodes. In addition, the unique interface design strategy is applied to other non-noble metal@CCA cathodes, which confirms the advantages of constructing nanostructure metal/C interfaces for improving the kinetics of CRR and CER. This fundamental understanding of the structure–performance relationship provides new inspiration for designing highly efficient cathode catalysts for Li–CO2 batteries.© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this research paper, the Chinese beehive culture in Fujian Province, China is used as the carrier, and the Mini-EfficientDet deep neural network after migration is used to identify common species at the hive door, that is, the identification of Chinese bees, wasps and cockroaches in the form of nymphs. In this paper, we define the modified model as Mini-EfficientDet by compressing the initial EfficientDet model and adding the category imbalance function, which makes it focus more on the recognition and classification of small targets while ensuring the recognition accuracy. Through the test on the MSCOCO2017 data set, it is concluded that when the backbone network adopts EfficientNet B7, it shows strong detection accuracy in detecting targets of various scales, which confirms the role of the category imbalance function proposed in this paper and the efficiency of the improved EfficientDet model. Detection accuracy. The pre-trained model is transferred to the field of beehive species detection through migration learning, that is, after the post-training of the self-collected data set, the detection accuracy of Chinese bee, cockroach, and wasp is 98.66%, 83.71%, and 82.06%. It has made sufficient algorithmic preparations for the later detection and early warning system of beehive species invasion.© 2022 Author(s).The CdIn2S4 semiconductor is considered a potential host for the implementation of intermediate band solar cells due to its ideal bandgap value and excellent photoelectric property. In this paper, the electronic structures of group IV elements (Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb)-doped CdIn2S4 have been investigated by using hybrid density functional calculations. In the case of Ge, Sn, and Pb doping, an isolated and partially occupied intermediated band with delocalized characteristics could be created in the bandgap of the host. The results of the projected density of states reveal that the intermediated band is derived from the hybridization between the S-3p and dopant-ns states. Thanks to the assistance of the impurity band, the optical absorption ability of the intermediate band semiconductor is greatly enhanced. Based on the detailed balance theory, the theoretical efficiencies of intermediate band solar cells made by Ge- and Pb-doped CdIn2S4 are estimated to be 45.0% and 49.2%, respectively, which are superior to the Shockley and Queisser limit (40.7%) of a single junction photovoltaic device. Moreover, the experimental synthesis of these impurity semiconductors is relatively feasible because substitutional doping at the octahedral position is energetically favorable. These findings would be helpful to the development of a high-efficiency intermediate band solar cell.© 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the all-surface nature of 2D materials renders many of them vulnerable to surrounding environments, especially etchants and water involved during wet transfer process. Up to now, a scalable and damage-free transfer method for sensitive 2D materials is still lacking. Here, we report a general damage-free transfer method for sensitive 2D materials. The as-transferred 2D materials exhibit well-preserved structural integrity and unaltered physical properties. We further develop a facile TEM sample preparation technique that allows direct recycling of materials on TEM grids with high fidelity. This recycling technique provides an unprecedented opportunity to precisely relate structural characterization with physical/chemical/electrical probing for the same samples. This method can be readily generalized to diverse nanomaterials for large-area damage-free transfer and enables in-depth investigation of structure-property relationship.© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a member of the methyltransferases family, a type-II arginine enzyme crucial for many cellular processes and associated with many cancer diseases. In this study, 2D QSAR study, pharmacophore-based 3D QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and binding free energy studies were carried out from a set of 61 reported potent compounds being inhibitors of PRMT5 protein. A five-point pharmacophore model (AADHR) was generated and this model is used to generate an atom-based 3-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D QSAR). The obtained 3D QSAR model has better correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.91), cross-validation coefficient (Q2 = 0.82), F value (140.3), low RMSE (0.47), and Pearson R value (0.91). A library of 329,825 molecules (ChEMBL database) is screened with the pharmacophore model to retrieve hit molecules that are further subjected for molecular docking to identify best fit-active conformations binding at the receptor site of PRMT5 protein. Furthermore, we calculated ADME and toxicity properties using the QikProp module and pkCSM server. The lead molecules were prioritized by glide scores and binding free energy studies. Finally, we have evaluated the stability of protein–ligand complexes by performing an all-atom MD simulation in explicit solvent. MD results further strengthen our findings.© 2022 Author(s).This investigation aims to wear analyze of acetabular cup on metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty with and without dimple addition.

All rights reserved.The developments of efficient and low-cost substitutes of precious metals as active electrocatalysts in electrochemical reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution, and reduction reaction) are the top priority in the field of renewable energy technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess many advantages, such as large specific surface area, adjustable pore size and topological structure, as well as diverse periodic organic and inorganic compositions. Therefore, MOFs have been considered as multifunctional precursors or sacrificial templates for the preparations of functional materials such as advanced electrodes or efficient electrochemical energy storage and conversion catalysts. In this chapter, our main purpose is to summarize the latest research achievements of MOF-derived hollow micro-/nanostructures and their applications in the fields of overall water splitting and Zn-air battery. To be specific, the hollow structures derived from MOFs precursors are firstly classified from their geometric shape, mainly including single-shelled and multishelled hollow structures, particle-in-box, and carved hollow structure. Moreover, the morphology-dependent electrocatalytic activity and possible enhanced mechanisms are discussed in detail. Next, we systemically discuss the latest strategies and internal mechanisms for electrocatalytic activity optimization from the following five aspects: Active site assembly, electronic structure regulation, single-atom catalyst, defect chemistry, and synergistic catalysis. At last, the current challenge, future perspective, and research direction ahead for the preparation and energy-related application of MOFs-derived hollow structure as robust catalysts are also outlined and highlighted.© 2022 Elsevier LtdSelf-assembling prodrugs are able to form stable nanoparticles without additional excipients and therefore have gained increasing interest in the field of drug delivery. As a natural derivative of vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulatory effects. However, the clinical translation of atRA has been hampered by its insufficient therapeutic efficacy. In this work, to fully maximize the therapeutic potential of atRA, we developed delicately designed self-assembling RABA (atRA-based hybrid prodrug) as a hybrid prodrug of atRA and hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA). RABA could form nanoassemblies and decompose to release atRA and HBA simultaneously in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In a mouse model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury, RABA nanoassemblies accumulated in liver preferentially and exerted highly potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects, leading to effective protection of liver from IR injury. RABA nanoassemblies exhibited significantly higher therapeutic efficacy than the combination of equivalent atRA and HBA. Given its H2O2-responsiveness, self-assembling and self-immolating behaviors, and cooperative therapeutic actions, RABA nanoassemblies have great potential as a pure nanodrug for hepatic IR injury. This study also provides a new valuable addition in the development of prodrug self-assemblies that will emerge as next generation of drugs.Copyright © 2022 Han, Wang, Yin, Li, Sun and Su.A nanoparticle-coated graphite target (NCGT) is presented to improve the analysis accuracy and stability of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). A stable, relatively homogeneous, and close to optically thin laser-induced breakdown plasma was obtained by dispersing sample nanoparticles on a high-purity graphite substrate. Spectral structures dominated by the characteristic lines of carbon and the samples can greatly simplify spectral identification and avoid line interference. To maximize the analysis accuracy and stability, a series of experimental conditions were optimized step by step according to the spectral intensity and signal-to-noise ratio of the lines. Based on the final optimized conditions, the relative standard deviation values of Mg, Fe, and Sr elemental content in Chinese medicinal material (CMM) samples were reduced from 17.7, 16.6, 12.1% of the pressed target to 4.8, 9.5, and 4.5% of the NCGT, respectively. Comparisons with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) results demonstrated that the present method has great potential for detection of LIBS.© 2022 IEEE.In the last years there has been a growing interest in adopting learning analytics (LA) in higher and further education systems. LA assists the institutional stakeholders to enhance the learning process, ameliorate the teaching activities, make adequate decisions and take appropriate actions based on the collection, analysis, and reporting of data generated from individual learners. The learning analytics approach aims to achieve many objectives, one of them is prediction which is the center of this research. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study between three machine learning algorithms; Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM); to predict the stream of new enrollments in the first year of higher education. As a case study, the predictive model is applied to new enrollments in the first year of the University Diploma of Technology (DUT) at the Higher School of Technology in Meknes, Morocco (ESTM). The performance of the classifiers is tested with and without the use of SMOTE data balancing on a dataset of 53554 students collected between 2016 and 2019. The obtained results show the best algorithm to predict the most accurate enrollments of students.Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.The ultimate goal of hydraulic stimulation in terms of business value is "production", especially in those cases where the well is approaching the economic limit, is to increase the hydrocarbon flow, improve the ultimate recovery and make it profitable. During a sing stage fracturing operation, extensive data is produced. Unfortunately, less than 10% of the data are properly preserved. Finally resides in corporate repositories. Comparable is the case of knowledge, where just in few cases, previous lessons learned are taken into consideration when designing a new job. Data Quality and human talent dedication are not the exception; data completeness levels of just 40% has been estimated. While Production Technologist and Frac Engineers during a normal Frac design, dedicate nearly much of their time on searching for data. It was identified the need for having a centralized database, and avoid the dissemination of "local" customized spreadsheets to track the fracturing activities. At the same time, there were no fracturing workflow identified, instead, multiple version depending on each well/cluster approach. Hydraulic Fracturing Project emerged as a corporate initiative to support the HF evolution, and the vision to provide the business the best tools (knowledge, standard process, data, and technical resources) to get the maximum benefit from this broadly adopted technology. The paper discusses the analytical aspects, operational workflow and administrative and quality control for properly managing the Frac data, from pre-Frac (job design) to post-Frac (job performance evaluation), embedding Frac execution, and including workflow. The data base allowed efficient management of hydraulic fracturing operations, better identification of the fracture candidates, and better design of fracturing treatment, Hence, Frac Platform will improve efficiency, performance & delivery well targets that could essentially reduce resources in data management.© 2022 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this research, a silver/K-carrageenan nanocomposite was synthesized using a chemical reduction method assisted by microwave irradiation using NaOH as an accelerator. The aims of this research is to determine the optimum conditions for the preparation of silver nanoparticles with NaOH variations, microwave irradiation time and, AgNO3 concentration. AgNO3 compounds function as precursors and K-carrageenan as a reducing agent, stabilizer and also a matrix in silver-K-Carrageenan nanocomposites. The formation of silver nanoparticles was identified using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer which is associated with the LSPR phenomenon. Testing of antibacterial activity using the diffusion method against S.Aureus bacteria. The results showed that the silver nanoparticles formed on the silver/K-Carrageenan nanocomposite were characterized by the appearance of an absorption band in the 400 nm region. NaOH concentration, irradiation time and AgNO3 concentration affect the absorbance value at the maximum absorption, which indicates the effect on the amount of silver nanoparticles. The optimal condition for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles is the use of NaOH 0,014 M with an irradiation time of 6 minutes. The concentration of AgNO3 precursor is directly proportional to the amount of silver nanoparticles formed in the nanocomposite. Silver/K-Carrageenan nanocomposite has high antibacterial activity and potential as antibacterial material.
